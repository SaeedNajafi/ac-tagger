Influential
members
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
introduced
legislation
that
would
restrict
how
the
new
savings-and-loan
bailout
agency
can
raise
capital
,
creating
another
potential
obstacle
to
the
government
's
sale
of
sick
thrifts
.

The
bill
,
whose
backers
include
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
(
D.
,
Ill.
)
,
would
prevent
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
from
raising
temporary
working
capital
by
having
an
RTC-owned
bank
or
thrift
issue
debt
that
would
n't
be
counted
on
the
federal
budget
.

The
bill
intends
to
restrict
the
RTC
to
Treasury
borrowings
only
,
unless
the
agency
receives
specific
congressional
authorization
.

``
Such
agency
`
self-help
'
borrowing
is
unauthorized
and
expensive
,
far
more
expensive
than
direct
Treasury
borrowing
,
''
said
Rep.
Fortney
Stark
(
D.
,
Calif.
)
,
the
bill
's
chief
sponsor
.

The
complex
financing
plan
in
the
S&L
bailout
law
includes
raising
$
30
billion
from
debt
issued
by
the
newly
created
RTC
.

This
financing
system
was
created
in
the
new
law
in
order
to
keep
the
bailout
spending
from
swelling
the
budget
deficit
.

Another
$
20
billion
would
be
raised
through
Treasury
bonds
,
which
pay
lower
interest
rates
.

But
the
RTC
also
requires
``
working
''
capital
to
maintain
the
bad
assets
of
thrifts
that
are
sold
,
until
the
assets
can
be
sold
separately
.

That
debt
would
be
paid
off
as
the
assets
are
sold
,
leaving
the
total
spending
for
the
bailout
at
$
50
billion
,
or
$
166
billion
including
interest
over
10
years
.

``
It
's
a
problem
that
clearly
has
to
be
resolved
,
''
said
David
Cooke
,
executive
director
of
the
RTC
.

The
agency
has
already
spent
roughly
$
19
billion
selling
34
insolvent
S&Ls
,
and
it
is
likely
to
sell
or
merge
600
by
the
time
the
bailout
concludes
.

Absent
other
working
capital
,
he
said
,
the
RTC
would
be
forced
to
delay
other
thrift
resolutions
until
cash
could
be
raised
by
selling
the
bad
assets
.

``
We
would
have
to
wait
until
we
have
collected
on
those
assets
before
we
can
move
forward
,
''
he
said
.

The
complicated
language
in
the
huge
new
law
has
muddied
the
fight
.

The
law
does
allow
the
RTC
to
borrow
from
the
Treasury
up
to
$
5
billion
at
any
time
.

Moreover
,
it
says
the
RTC
's
total
obligations
may
not
exceed
$
50
billion
,
but
that
figure
is
derived
after
including
notes
and
other
debt
,
and
subtracting
from
it
the
market
value
of
the
assets
the
RTC
holds
.

But
Congress
did
n't
anticipate
or
intend
more
public
debt
,
say
opponents
of
the
RTC
's
working-capital
plan
,
and
Rep.
Charles
Schumer
(
D.
,
N.Y
.

)
said
the
RTC
Oversight
Board
has
been
remiss
in
not
keeping
Congress
informed
.

``
That
secrecy
leads
to
a
proposal
like
the
one
from
Ways
and
Means
,
which
seems
to
me
sort
of
draconian
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
RTC
is
going
to
have
to
pay
a
price
of
prior
consultation
on
the
Hill
if
they
want
that
kind
of
flexibility
.

''
The
Ways
and
Means
Committee
will
hold
a
hearing
on
the
bill
next
Tuesday
.

We
're
about
to
see
if
advertising
works
.

Hard
on
the
heels
of
Friday
's
190-point
stock-market
plunge
and
the
uncertainty
that
's
followed
,
a
few
big
brokerage
firms
are
rolling
out
new
ads
trumpeting
a
familiar
message
:
Keep
on
investing
,
the
market
's
just
fine
.

Their
mission
is
to
keep
clients
from
fleeing
the
market
,
as
individual
investors
did
in
droves
after
the
crash
in
October
Just
days
after
the
1987
crash
,
major
brokerage
firms
rushed
out
ads
to
calm
investors
.

This
time
around
,
they
're
moving
even
faster
.

PaineWebber
Inc.
filmed
a
new
television
commercial
at
4
p.m.
EDT
yesterday
and
had
it
on
the
air
by
last
night
.

Fidelity
Investments
placed
new
ads
in
newspapers
yesterday
,
and
wrote
another
new
ad
appearing
today
.

Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
by
yesterday
afternoon
had
already
written
new
TV
ads
.

It
considered
running
them
during
tomorrow
night
's
World
Series
broadcast
but
decided
not
to
when
the
market
recovered
yesterday
.

Other
brokerage
firms
,
including
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
,
were
plotting
out
potential
new
ad
strategies
.

The
brokerage
firms
learned
a
lesson
the
last
time
around
,
when
frightened
investors
flooded
the
phone
lines
and
fled
the
market
in
a
panic
.

This
time
,
the
firms
were
ready
.

Fidelity
,
for
example
,
prepared
ads
several
months
ago
in
case
of
a
market
plunge
.

When
the
market
went
into
its
free
fall
Friday
afternoon
,
the
investment
firm
ordered
full
pages
in
the
Monday
editions
of
half
a
dozen
newspapers
.

The
ads
touted
Fidelity
's
automated
800-number
beneath
the
huge
headline
,
``
Fidelity
Is
Ready
For
Your
Call
.

''
A
Fidelity
spokesman
says
the
800-line
,
which
already
was
operating
but
which
many
clients
did
n't
know
about
,
received
about
double
the
usual
volume
of
calls
over
the
weekend
.

``
A
lot
of
investor
confidence
comes
from
the
fact
that
they
can
speak
to
us
,
''
he
says
.

``
To
maintain
that
dialogue
is
absolutely
crucial
.

It
would
have
been
too
late
to
think
about
on
Friday
.

We
had
to
think
about
it
ahead
of
time
.

''
Today
's
Fidelity
ad
goes
a
step
further
,
encouraging
investors
to
stay
in
the
market
or
even
to
plunge
in
with
Fidelity
.

Underneath
the
headline
``
Diversification
,
''
it
counsels
,
``
Based
on
the
events
of
the
past
week
,
all
investors
need
to
know
their
portfolios
are
balanced
to
help
protect
them
against
the
market
's
volatility
.

''
It
goes
on
to
plug
a
few
diversified
Fidelity
funds
by
name
.

PaineWebber
also
was
able
to
gear
up
quickly
thanks
to
the
1987
crash
.

In
the
aftermath
of
the
1987
debacle
,
the
brokerage
firm
began
taping
commercials
in-house
,
ultimately
getting
its
timing
down
fast
enough
to
tape
a
commercial
after
the
market
closed
and
rush
it
on
the
air
that
night
.

It
also
negotiated
an
arrangement
with
Cable
News
Network
under
which
CNN
would
agree
to
air
its
last-minute
creations
.

The
new
PaineWebber
commercial
,
created
with
ad
agency
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
,
features
Mary
Farrell
,
one
of
the
firm
's
most
visible
investment
strategists
,
sounding
particularly
bullish
.

Taped
just
as
the
market
closed
yesterday
,
it
offers
Ms.
Farrell
advising
,
``
We
view
the
market
here
as
going
through
a
relatively
normal
cycle
...
.

We
continue
to
feel
that
the
stock
market
is
still
the
place
to
be
for
long-term
appreciation
.

''
The
spot
was
scheduled
to
appear
three
times
on
CNN
last
night
.

PaineWebber
considered
an
even
harder
sell
,
recommending
specific
stocks
.

Instead
,
it
settled
on
just
urging
the
clients
who
are
its
lifeline
to
keep
that
money
in
the
market
.

``
We
're
saying
the
worst
thing
that
anyone
can
do
is
to
see
the
market
go
down
and
dump
everything
,
which
just
drives
the
prices
down
further
,
''
says
John
Lampe
,
PaineWebber
's
director
of
advertising
.

``
If
you
owned
it
and
liked
it
Friday
,
the
true
value
has
n't
changed
.

''
He
adds
,
``
This
is
n't
1987
revisited
.

''
With
the
market
fluctuating
and
then
closing
up
more
than
88
points
yesterday
,
investment
firms
had
to
constantly
revise
their
approach
.

At
Shearson
Lehman
,
executives
created
potential
new
commercials
Friday
night
and
throughout
the
weekend
,
then
had
to
regroup
yesterday
afternoon
.

The
plan
had
been
to
make
one
of
Shearson
's
easy-to-film
,
black-and-white
``
Where
We
Stand
''
commercials
,
which
have
been
running
occasionally
in
response
to
news
events
since
1985
.

The
ad
would
have
run
during
the
World
Series
tomorrow
,
replacing
the
debut
commercial
of
Shearson
's
new
ad
campaign
,
``
Leadership
by
Example
.

''
But
in
a
meeting
after
the
market
closed
yesterday
,
Shearson
executives
decided
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
stock-market
ad
.

``
We
do
n't
think
at
this
point
anything
needs
to
be
said
.

The
market
seems
to
be
straightening
out
;
we
're
taking
a
wait-and-see
attitude
,
''
says
Cathleen
B.
Stewart
,
executive
vice
president
of
marketing
.

In
any
case
,
the
brokerage
firms
are
clearly
moving
faster
to
create
new
ads
than
they
did
in
the
fall
of
1987
.

But
it
remains
to
be
seen
whether
their
ads
will
be
any
more
effective
.

In
1987
,
despite
a
barrage
of
ads
from
most
of
the
major
investment
firms
,
individuals
ran
from
the
market
en
masse
.

Now
the
firms
must
try
their
hardest
to
prove
that
advertising
can
work
this
time
around
.

ARNOLD
ADVERTISING
:
Edward
Eskandarian
,
former
chairman
of
Della
Femina
,
McNamee
,
reached
an
agreement
in
principle
to
acquire
a
majority
stake
in
Arnold
Advertising
,
a
small
Boston
shop
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

Mr.
Eskandarian
,
who
resigned
his
Della

post
in
September
,
becomes
chairman
and
chief

of
Arnold

John
Verret
,
the
agency
's
president
and
chief

,
will
retain
the
title
of

.

Separately
,
McDonald

named
Arnold
to
handle
its
estimated

A

.

The

,
the
largest
ever
for
the

,
includes
ads
from
52
corporate
advertisers
and
kicks
off
a
two-year

10,000
monkeys
placed
before
10,000
pianos
would
produce
1,118
publishable
rock
'n'
roll
tunes
.

Baseball
,
that
game
of
the
long
haul
,
is
the
quintessential
sport
of
the
mean
,
and
the
mean
ol'
law
caught
up
with
the
San
Francisco
Giants
in
the
World
Series
last
weekend
.

The
team
that
dumped
runs
by
the
bushel
on
the
Chicago
Cubs
in
the
National
League
playoffs
was
held
to
just
one
in
two
games
by
the
home-team
Oakland
A
's
,
the
gang
that
had
been
done
unto
similarly
by
the
Los
Angeles
Dodgers
and
Orel
Hershiser
in
last
year
's
tournament
.

Morever
,
much
of
the
damage
was
accomplished
by
A
's
who
had
some
catching
up
to
do
.

In
game
two
,
on
a
cool
Sunday
evening
in
this
land
of
perpetual
autumn
,
a
lot
of
the
catching
up
was
done
by
the
A
's
catcher
,
Terry
Steinbach
.

He
hit
a
2-0
pitch
from
Rick
Reuschel
into
the
left-field
stands
in
inning
four
to
stretch
his
team
's
lead
from
2-1
to
a
decisive
5-1
,
where
it
stayed
.

So
what
if
Steinbach
had
struck
just
seven
home
runs
in
130
regular-season
games
,
and
batted
in
the
seventh
position
of
the
A
's
lineup
.

``
If
you
get
your
pitch
,
and
take
a
good
swing
,
anything
can
happen
,
''
he
later
remarked
.

On
Saturday
night
,
quite
a
few
of
the
boys
in
green
and
gold
salted
away
successes
to
salve
the
pain
of
past
and
,
no
doubt
,
future
droughts
.

Mark
McGwire
,
the
big
,
red-haired
Oakland
first
baseman
,
had
three
hits
in
four
at
bats
,
two
more
than
he
'd
had
in
the
five-game
Dodger
series
in
which
he
'd
gone
1-for-17
.

The
A-men
batting
Nos.
6
through
9
,
a.k.a.
the
``
bottom
of
the
order
,
''
got
seven
of
their
team
's
11
hits
and
scored
four
of
its
runs
in
a
5-0
decision
.

Right-hander
Dave
Stewart
held
the
Giants
to
five
hits
to
account
for
the
zero
on
the
other
side
of
the
Saturday
ledger
.

That
he
was
the
A
's
winningest
pitcher
during
its
American
League
campaign
with
a
21-9
mark
,
plus
two
wins
over
Toronto
in
the
playoffs
,
indicates
he
may
have
some
evening
up
coming
,
but
with
the
way
his
split-fingered
fastball
is
behaving
,
that
might
not
be
this
week
.

The
same
goes
for
Mike
Moore
,
another
veteran
who
overcame
early
struggles
to
permit
the
Giants
but
a
run
and
four
hits
in
seven
innings
in
Sunday
's
contest
.

``
Every
guy
they
put
out
there
had
a
better
split-finger
than
the
guy
before
,
''
marveled
Giant
manager
Roger
Craig
.

He
's
an
ex-hurler
who
's
one
of
the
leading
gurus
of
the
fashionable
delivery
,
which
looks
like
a
fastball
until
it
dives
beneath
the
lunging
bat
.

The
upshot
of
the
downshoot
is
that
the
A
's
go
into
San
Francisco
's
Candlestick
Park
tonight
up
two
games
to
none
in
the
best-of-seven
fest
.

The
stat
to
reckon
with
here
says
that
about
three
of
four
clubs
(
29
of
39
)
that
took
2-0
Series
leads
went
on
to
win
it
all
.

That
's
not
an
average
to
soothe
Giant
rooters
.

One
might
think
that
the
home
fans
in
this
Series
of
the
Subway
Called
BART
(
that
's
a
better
name
for
a
public
conveyance
than
``
Desire
,
''
do
n't
you
think
?
)
would
have
been
ecstatic
over
the
proceedings
,
but
they
observe
them
in
relative
calm
.

Partisans
of
the
two
combatants
sat
side
by
side
in
the
49,000-plus
seats
of
Oakland
Coliseum
,
and
while
they
cheered
their
favorites
and
booed
the
opposition
,
hostilities
advanced
no
further
,
at
least
as
far
as
I
could
see
.

A
few
folks
even
showed
up
wearing
caps
bearing
the
colors
and
emblems
of
both
teams
.

``
I
'm
for
the
Giants
today
,
but
only
because
they
lost
yesterday
.

I
love
'em
both
.

The
only
thing
I
'm
rooting
for
is
for
the
Series
to
go
seven
games
,
''
said
David
Williams
,
a
Sacramento
septuagenarian
,
at
the
Coliseum
before
Sunday
's
go
.

The
above
represents
a
triumph
of
either
apathy
or
civility
.

I
choose
to
believe
it
's
the
latter
,
although
it
probably
springs
from
the
fact
that
just
about
everyone
out
here
,
including
the
A
's
and
Giants
,
is
originally
from
somewhere
else
.

Suffice
it
to
say
that
if
this
were
a
New
York
Yankees-Mets
series
,
or
one
between
the
Chicago
Cubs
and
White
Sox
(
hey
,
it
's
possible
)
,
you
'd
need
uniformed
police
in
every
other
seat
to
separate
opposing
fans
,
and
only
the
suicidal
would
bifurcate
their
bonnets
.

Anyway
,
the
A
's
gave
you
a
lot
of
heroes
to
root
for
.

In
the
opening
game
,
besides
Steinbach
and
Stewart
,
there
was
Walt
Weiss
,
a
twiggy-looking
,
second-year
shortstop
who
had
lost
a
couple
months
of
the
season
to
knee
surgery
.

He
was
flawless
afield
(
ditto
in
game
two
)
,
moved
a
runner
along
in
the
A
's
three-run
second
inning
,
and
homered
for
his
team
's
final
tally
.

Such
is
his
reputation
among
the
East
Bay
Bashers
that
when
he
hit
his
first
career
home
run
last
season
,
the
fan
who
caught
it
agreed
to
turn
the
ball
over
to
him
in
return
for
an
autograph
.

Not
his
autograph
;
power-hitter
McGwire
's
.

An
A
's
co-hero
of
the
second
game
was
Rickey
Henderson
,
who
exemplifies
the
hot
side
of
the
hot-cold
equation
.

He
smoked
Toronto
in
the
playoffs
with
six
hits
,
seven
walks
and
eight
stolen
bases
in
22
at
bats
,
and
continued
that
by
going
3-for-3
at
the
plate
Sunday
,
along
with
walking
,
stealing
a
base
and
scoring
a
run
.

``
When
you
're
in
the
groove
,
you
see
every
ball
tremendously
,
''
he
lectured
.

The
cold
guys
in
the
set
were
Will
Clark
,
Kevin
Mitchell
and
Matt
Williams
,
the
Giants
'
3-4-5
hitters
.

They
combined
for
25
hits
,
six
home
runs
and
24
runs
batted
in
in
the
five
games
against
the
Cubs
.

They
went
a
collective
5-for-24
here
,
with
zero
homers
and
ribbies
.

It
's
that
last
set
of
numbers
,
as
much
as
anything
else
,
that
gives
the
Giants
hope
in
the
Series
games
to
come
.

``
I
believe
in
the
law
of
averages
,
''
declared
San
Francisco
batting
coach
Dusty
Baker
after
game
two
.

``
I
'd
rather
see
a
so-so
hitter
who
's
hot
come
up
for
the
other
side
than
a
good
hitter
who
's
cold
.

''
But
the
old
Dodger
slugger
wisely
offered
no
prediction
about
when
good
times
would
return
to
his
side
.

``
When
it
goes
,
you
never
know
when
you
'll
get
it
back
,
''
he
said
.

``
That
's
baseball
.

''
NCR
Corp.
reported
a
10
%
drop
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
citing
intense
competition
that
caused
its
gross
profit
margins
to
dip
.

Net
income
for
the
quarter
fell
to
$
93.1
million
from
$
103.1
million
,
roughly
what
analysts
had
expected
.

But
per-share
profit
dropped
only
2
%
to
$
1.23
a
share
from
$
1.26
a
share
,
as
the
company
continued
its
stock
buy-back
plan
.

Average
shares
outstanding
dropped
to
75.8
million
from
82.1
million
.

Revenue
fell
1
%
to
$
1.39
billion
from
$
1.41
billion
.

The
computer
maker
,
which
sells
more
than
half
its
goods
outside
the
U.S.
,
also
said
the
negative
effect
of
a
stronger
U.S.
dollar
will
``
adversely
affect
''
its
fourth-quarter
performance
and
``
make
it
difficult
''
to
better
1988
results
.

NCR
said
revenue
declined
both
in
the
U.S.
and
overseas
,
reflecting
a
world-wide
softening
of
the
computer
markets
.

The
company
,
however
,
said
orders
in
the
U.S.
showed
``
good
gains
''
during
the
latest
quarter
.

Analysts
estimate
those
gains
at
12
%
to
13
%
,
a
good
part
of
it
coming
from
large
orders
placed
by
a
few
of
NCR
's
major
customers
.

In
addition
to
a
general
slowing
of
the
computer
industry
,
NCR
,
which
sells
automated
teller
machines
and
computerized
cash
registers
,
is
also
affected
by
the
retail
and
financial
sectors
,
``
areas
of
the
economy
that
have
generally
not
been
robust
,
''
notes
Sanjiv
G.
Hingorani
,
an
analyst
for
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
.

These
factors
,
combined
with
a
strong
dollar
,
should
negatively
affect
the
current
quarter
's
results
,
NCR
said
.

In
the
year-earlier
fourth
quarter
,
NCR
had
profit
of
$
149.6
million
,
or
$
1.85
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
1.8
billion
.

Mr.
Hingorani
said
he
lowered
his
full-year
estimates
for
1989
to
$
5.35
a
share
from
$
5.50
a
share
.

Revenue
projections
were
slashed
to
$
6.03
billion
from
$
6.20
billion
.

Last
year
,
NCR
had
net
income
of
$
439.3
million
,
or
$
5.33
a
share
,
on
$
5.99
billion
in
revenue
.

For
the
nine
months
,
the
company
's
earnings
fell
9
%
to
$
264.6
million
,
or
$
3.40
a
share
,
from
$
289.7
million
,
or
$
3.49
a
share
.

Revenues
declined
1
%
to
$
4.17
billion
from
$
4.19
billion
.

In

Concerning

I
'm
delighted
that
Wall

is
finally
tuning
in
to
the
hard
,
cold
facts
of
the
real

If
the

serious

why
limit
the
practice
to
the
poor

maligned

whose
ability
to
see
into

is
fragile
at
best
?
Why
not
extend
the
same
harsh
standards
to
the
sales
force
,
and
pay
brokers
a
base
salary
with
annual
bonus
based
on
how
much
money
they
made
for
their
clients
during
the

That

a

driven
only

would

half
hours
before
the

At

J.
Francis
Palamara
did
n't
reach
the

until
5:30
a.m.
,
but
then
he
had
been
up
most
of
the
night
at
home
.

``
I
had

all

''
For
many
of
London
's
securities
traders
,
it
was
a
day
that
started
nervously
in
the
small
hours
.

By
lunchtime
,
the
selling
was
at
near-panic
fever
.

But
as
the
day
ended
in
a
frantic
Wall
Street-inspired
rally
,
the
City
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
.

So
it
went
yesterday
in
the
trading
rooms
of
London
's
financial
district
.

In
the
wake
of
Wall
Street
's
plunge
last
Friday
,
the
London
market
was
considered
especially
vulnerable
.

And
before
the
opening
of
trading
here
yesterday
,
all
eyes
were
on
early
trading
in
Tokyo
for
a
clue
as
to
how
widespread
the
fallout
might
be
.

By
the
time
trading
officially
got
under
way
at
9
a.m.
,
the
news
from
Asia
was
in
.

And
it
left
mixed
signals
for
London
.

Tokyo
stocks
closed
off
a
significant
but
less-than-alarming
1.8
%
on
thin
volume
;
Hong
Kong
stocks
declined
6.5
%
in
orderly
trading
.

At
Jefferies
'
trading
room
on
Finsbury
Circus
,
a
stately
circle
at
the
edge
of
the
financial
district
,
desktop
computer
screens
displayed
the
London
market
's
major
barometer
--
the
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100
Share
Index
.

Red
figures
on
the
screens
indicated
falling
stocks
;
blue
figures
,
rising
stocks
.

Right
away
,
the
reds
outnumbered
the
blues
,
80
to
20
,
as
the
index
opened
at
2076.8
,
off
157.1
points
,
or
7
%
.

``
I
see
concern
,
but
I
do
n't
see
any
panic
,
''
said
Mr.
Palamara
,
a
big
,
good-humored
New
York
native
who
runs
the
15-trader
office
.

The
Jefferies
office
,
a
branch
of
the
Los
Angeles-based
firm
,
played
it
conservatively
,
seeking
to
avoid
risk
.

``
This
is
not
the
sort
of
market
to
have
a
big
position
in
,
''
said
David
Smith
,
who
heads
trading
in
all
non-U.S.
stocks
.

``
We
tend
to
run
a
very
tight
book
.

''
Jefferies
spent
most
of
its
energies
in
the
morning
trying
to
match
buyers
and
sellers
,
and
there
were
n't
many
buyers
.

``
All
the
takeover
stocks
--
Scottish
&
Newcastle
,
B.A.T
,
DRG
--
are
getting
pretty
well
pasted
this
morning
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

Seconds
later
,
a
7,500-share
``
sell
''
order
for
Scottish
&
Newcastle
came
in
.

For
the
third
time
in
15
minutes
,
a
trader
next
to
Mr.
Smith
left
the
no-smoking
area
to
have
a
cigarette
.

On
the
screens
,
only
two
forlorn
blue
figures
remained
,
but
the
index
had
recovered
a
few
points
and
was
off
about
140
.

``
Because
Tokyo
did
n't
collapse
,
let
's
pick
up
a
little
stock
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

He
targeted
7,500
shares
of
Reuters
and
punched
a
button
to
call
up
on
his
screen
other
dealers
'
price
quotes
.

The
vivid
yellow
figures
showed
the
best
price
at
845
pence
,
(
$
13.27
)
and
Mr.
Smith
's
traders
started
putting
out
feelers
.

But
the
market
sensed
a
serious
buyer
on
a
day
dominated
by
selling
,
and
the
quotes
immediately
jumped
to
850
pence
.

``
When
I
want
to
buy
,
they
run
from
you
--
they
keep
changing
their
prices
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
.

``
It
's
very
frustrating
.

''
He
temporarily
abandoned
his
search
for
the
Reuters
shares
.

By
this
time
,
it
was
4:30
a.m.
in
New
York
,
and
Mr.
Smith
fielded
a
call
from
a
New
York
customer
wanting
an
opinion
on
the
British
stock
market
,
which
had
been
having
troubles
of
its
own
even
before
Friday
's
New
York
market
break
.

``
Fundamentally
dangerous
...
,
''
Mr.
Smith
said
,
almost
in
a
whisper
,
``
...
.

fundamentally
weak
...
fairly
vulnerable
still
...
extremely
dangerously
poised
...
we
're
in
for
a
lot
of
turbulence
...
.

''
He
was
right
.

By
midday
,
the
London
market
was
in
full
retreat
.

``
It
's
falling
like
a
stone
,
''
said
Danny
Linger
,
a
pit
trader
who
was
standing
outside
the
London
International
Financial
Futures
Exchange
.

Only
half
the
usual
lunchtime
crowd
gathered
at
the
tony
Corney
&
Barrow
wine
bar
on
Old
Broad
Street
nearby
.

Conversation
was
subdued
as
most
patrons
watched
the
latest
market
statistics
on
television
.

At
12:49
p.m.
,
the
index
hit
its
low
,
2029.7
,
off
204.2
points
.

``
France
opened
the
limit
down
,
off
at
least
10
%
if
you
could
calculate
the
index
,
which
you
could
n't
,
''
Mr.
Clark
,
the
Shearson
trader
,
said
early
in
the
afternoon
.

``
Spain
is
down
10
%
and
suspended
,
Sweden
's
down
8
%
,
Norway
11
%
.

This
market
has
been
very
badly
damaged
.

''
As
2:30
p.m.
--
Wall
Street
's
opening
time
--
neared
,
Shearson
traders
and
salesmen
traded
bets
on
how
low
the
New
York
market
would
open
.

In
the
center
of
the
trading
floor
,
chief
trader
Roger
Streeter
and
two
colleagues
scrambled
for
the
telephones
as
soon
as
the
New
York
market
opened
--
plummeting
more
than
60
points
in
the
first
few
minutes
.

They
saw
an
opportunity
created
by
the
sell-off
.

As
Wall
Street
traders
dumped
American
Depositary
Receipts
in
Jaguar
PLC
,
Mr.
Streeter
and
trader
Sam
Ruiz
bought
them
to
resell
in
the
U.K
.

Investors
here
still
expect
Ford
Motor
Co.
or
General
Motors
Corp.
to
bid
for
Jaguar
.

Suddenly
,
after
about
45
minutes
,
the
U.S.
markets
rallied
.

``
The
MMI
has
gone
better
,
''
shouted
one
trader
at
about
3:15
London
time
,
as
the
U.S.
Major
Markets
Index
contract
suddenly
indicated
a
turnabout
.

As
Wall
Street
strengthened
,
the
London
trading
room
went
wild
.

Traders
shouted
as
their
screens
posted
an
ever-narrowing
loss
on
Wall
Street
.

Then
,
nine
minutes
later
,
Wall
Street
suddenly
rebounded
to
a
gain
on
the
day
.

``
Rally
!
Rally
!
Rally
!
''
shouted
Shearson
trader
Andy
Rosen
,
selling
more
Jaguar
shares
.

``
This
is
panic
buying
!
''
As
the
London
market
rallied
,
some
wondered
whether
the
weekend
of
worrying
and
jitters
had
been
worth
it
.

The
London
index
closed
at
2163.4
,
its
high
for
the
day
,
off
70.5
,
or
about
3.3
%
.

Ambassador
Paul
Nitze
's
statement
(
Notable
&
Quotable
,
Sept.
20
)
,
``
If
you
have
a
million
people
working
for
you
,
every
bad
thing
that
has
one
chance
in
a
million
of
going
wrong
will
go
wrong
at
least
once
a
year
,
''
is
a
pretty
negative
way
of
looking
at
things
.

Is
n't
it
just
as
fair
to
say
that
if
you
have
a
million
people
working
for
you
,
every
good
thing
that
has
one
chance
in
a
million
of
going
right
will
go
right
at
least
once
a
year
?
Do
n't
be
such
a
pessimist
,
Mr.
Ambassador

The
House
Aviation
Subcommittee
approved
a
bill
that
would
give
the
transportation
secretary
authority
to
review
and
approve
leveraged
buy-outs
of
major
U.S.
airlines
.

The
collapsed
plan
to
acquire
UAL
Corp.
,
parent
of
United
Airlines
,
spurred
quick
action
on
the
legislation
,
introduced
Wednesday
and
approved
by
the
subcommittee
on
a
voice
vote
yesterday
.

The
bill
is
expected
to
be
taken
up
by
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
tomorrow
,
and
a
floor
vote
by
next
week
will
be
urged
.

The
measure
drew
criticism
from
the
Bush
administration
and
a
parting
shot
from
financier
Donald
Trump
,
who
yesterday
withdrew
his
takeover
bid
for
AMR
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
.

In
a
letter
to
subcommittee
Chairman
James
Oberstar
(
D.
,
Minn.
)
,
Mr.
Trump
criticized
the
bill
as
an
explicit
effort
to
thwart
his
bid
for
AMR
,
and
said
it
contributed
to
the
collapse
of
the
deal
.

Elaine
Chao
,
deputy
transportation
secretary
,
also
sent
a
letter
to
express
the
administration
's
opposition
to
the
bill
``
in
its
present
form
.

''
Rep.
Oberstar
brushed
off
Mr.
Trump
's
allegations
as
an
``
excuse
for
his
own
deal
failing
.

''
He
also
said
the
fact
that
the
other
letter
had
n't
come
from
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
indicated
there
is
``
wiggle
room
''
in
the
administration
's
position
.

Mr.
Oberstar
and
other
committee
members
repeatedly
stressed
that
the
legislation
was
n't
a
response
to
any
particular
market
situation
.

But
they
cited
the
UAL
and
AMR
examples
as
reasons
to
move
quickly
to
enact
this
legislation
.

Aides
both
in
the
House
and
Senate
said
the
withdrawal
of
the
Trump
bid
for
AMR
is
n't
likely
to
deflate
efforts
to
push
the
legislation
.

``
It
's
still
on
the
fast
track
and
we
still
want
to
do
it
,
''
said
one
Senate
aide
.

The
bill
is
aimed
at
addressing
the
concern
that
an
airline
might
sacrifice
costly
safety
measures
to
pay
off
the
debt
incurred
in
a
leveraged
buy-out
.

Currently
,
the
transportation
secretary
does
n't
have
clearly
established
authority
to
block
mergers
,
but
can
take
the
drastic
step
of
revoking
the
operating
certificate
of
any
carrier
the
official
considers
unfit
.

Supporters
of
the
legislation
view
the
bill
as
an
effort
to
add
stability
and
certainty
to
the
airline-acquisition
process
,
and
to
preserve
the
safety
and
fitness
of
the
industry
.

In
general
,
the
bill
would
give
the
Transportation
Department
a
30-day
review
period
before
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
a
major
U.S.
air
carrier
could
be
acquired
.

It
also
would
require
the
acquiring
party
to
notify
the
transportation
secretary
and
to
provide
all
information
relevant
to
determining
the
intent
of
the
acquisition
.

The
bill
would
allow
the
secretary
to
reject
a
buy-out
if
sufficient
information
has
n't
been
provided
,
or
if
the
buy-out
is
likely
to
weaken
the
carrier
financially
,
result
in
a
substantial
reduction
in
size
of
the
airline
through
disposal
of
assets
,
or
give
control
to
a
foreign
interest
.

If
more
information
is
needed
,
the
secretary
would
have
authority
to
extend
the
review
period
20
days
.

All
the
witnesses
,
both
congressmen
and
industry
experts
,
expressed
support
for
the
bill
in
order
to
prevent
profiteers
from
cashing
in
on
airline
profits
at
the
expense
of
safe
,
cost-effective
service
.

But
several
committee
members
disapproved
,
some
backing
Mr.
Trump
's
claim
that
the
threat
of
regulation
caused
the
failure
of
the
UAL
deal
and
the
stock-market
plunge
.

One
of
the
major
concerns
expressed
by
the
dissenters
was
that
large
airlines
would
be
prohibited
from
divesting
themselves
of
smaller
entities
and
producing
independent
spin-off
companies
.

In
a
possible
prelude
to
the
resumption
of
talks
between
Boeing
Co.
and
striking
Machinists
union
members
,
a
federal
mediator
said
representatives
of
the
two
sides
will
meet
with
him
tomorrow
.

``
It
could
be
a
long
meeting
or
it
could
be
a
short
one
,
''
said
Doug
Hammond
,
the
mediator
,
who
called
the
agreement
to
meet
a
first
step
toward
a
resumption
of
negotiations
.

``
We
're
encouraged
that
talks
are
scheduled
again
but
beyond
that
,
we
have
made
no
expression
of
expectations
,
''
a
Boeing
spokesman
said
.

The
Machinists
union
has
rejected
a
three-year
contract
offer
that
would
have
provided
a
10
%
wage
increase
over
the
life
of
the
pact
,
plus
some
bonuses
.

Currently
,
average
pay
for
machinists
is
$
13.39
an
hour
,
Boeing
said
.

Now
in
its
13th
day
,
the
strike
has
idled
about
55,000
machinists
and
has
started
to
delay
delivery
of
some
jetliners
.

With
a
strike
fund
of
about
$
100
million
,
the
union
had
said
it
was
prepared
for
a
long
strike
.

After
the
third
week
on
strike
,
union
members
will
begin
receiving
$
100
a
week
from
the
fund
.

Work
at
Boeing
continues
with
supervisors
and
other
non-striking
personnel
manning
the
lines
.

And
at
the
company
's
Wichita
,
Kan.
,
plant
,
about
2,400
of
the
11,700
machinists
still
are
working
,
Boeing
said
.

Under
Kansas
right-to-work
laws
,
contracts
can
not
require
workers
to
be
union
members
.

Boeing
has
declined
to
say
how
many
employees
are
working
at
its
giant
Renton
,
Wash.
,
plant
.

Union
officials
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

DPC
Acquisition
Partners
,
a
hostile
suitor
for
Dataproducts
Corp.
,
said
it
intends
to
launch
a
tender
offer
for
the
computer
printer
maker
's
common
stock
.

DPC
,
a
group
led
by
the
New
York
investment
firm
Crescott
Inc.
,
also
said
it
plans
to
file
preliminary
materials
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
regarding
a
shareholder
solicitation
to
oust
Dataproducts
'
board
.

DPC
holds
a
7.8
%
stake
in
Dataproducts
and
made
a
$
15-a-share
bid
for
the
company
in
May
,
but
Dataproducts
management
considered
the
$
283.7
million
proposal
unacceptable
.

A
DPC
spokesman
declined
to
elaborate
on
the
group
's
new
plan
.

In
American
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
yesterday
,
Dataproducts
shares
jumped
62.5
cents
to
close
at
$
9.375
.

Dataproducts
,
which
had
been
seeking
a
buyer
for
several
months
,
announced
a
restructuring
plan
in
September
and
took
itself
off
the
auction
block
.

The
company
's
restructuring
includes
plans
to
split
into
three
sectors
,
to
phase
out
domestic
printer
manufacturing
operations
and
to
sell
its
New
England
subsidiary
.

As
part
of
the
plan
,
Dataproducts
announced
a
pact
to
sell
$
63
million
of
its
real
estate
holdings
to
Trizec
Properties
Inc.
,
a
unit
of
Canada
's
Trizec
Corp
.

Jack
Davis
,
Dataproducts
'
president
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
company
``
is
at
a
loss
to
understand
DPC
's
intentions
.

''
He
called
today
's
announcement
``
opportunistic
and
disruptive
''
and
said
the
company
intends
to
proceed
with
its
restructuring
.

Share
prices
plummeted
across
Europe
yesterday
in
response
to
Friday
's
New
York
sell-off
,
but
some
issues
staged
a
late
comeback
after
Wall
Street
opened
without
another
rout
.

European
investors
have
further
reason
for
optimism
today
,
after
the
U.S.
rebound
.

The
Frankfurt
Stock
Exchange
,
which
closed
before
the
New
York
exchanges
opened
,
was
the
hardest
hit
of
the
major
European
markets
,
with
the
DAX
Index
dropping
12.8
%
.

In
London
,
prices
plummeted
in
early
trading
and
were
off
as
much
as
9
%
before
coming
back
strong
after
the
New
York
opening
to
close
down
only
3.2
%
.

West
German
Economics
Minister
Helmut
Haussmann
said
,
``
In
my
view
,
the
stock
market
will
stabilize
relatively
quickly
.

There
may
be
one
or
other
psychological
or
technical
reactions
,
but
they
are
n't
based
on
fundamentals
.

The
economy
of
West
Germany
and
the
EC
{
European
Community
}
is
highly
stable
.

''
Paris
,
which
has
been
the
center
of
speculation
fever
in
recent
weeks
,
also
was
hard
hit
.

Share
prices
fell
in
Milan
,
Amsterdam
,
Zurich
,
Madrid
and
Stockholm
.

Prices
in
Brussels
,
where
a
computer
breakdown
disrupted
trading
,
also
tumbled
.

Following
is
a
breakdown
of
major
market
activity
:
FRANKFURT
:
One
of
the
sharpest
declines
came
in
the
financial
center
of
Europe
's
strongest
economy
.

The
DAX
Index
of
30
West
German
blue
chips
plunged
12.8
%
,
a
one-day
record
,
wiping
out
the
summer
's
gains
.

The
index
closed
at
1385.72
,
down
203.56
points
.

By
comparison
,
two
years
ago
on
Black
Monday
,
the
new
index
would
have
dropped
9.4
%
,
according
to
a
projection
by
the
exchange
.

Investors
may
have
reacted
so
strongly
to
Friday
's
U.S.
stock
market
loss
because
they
had
vivid
memories
of
the
Frankfurt
exchange
's
losing
35
%
of
its
value
in
the
1987
crash
and
its
wake
.

This
time
,
however
,
many
small
investors
may
have
been
hurt
by
acting
so
swiftly
.

``
They
all
went
in
the
wrong
direction
,
''
said
Andreas
Insam
,
an
investment
adviser
for
the
Bank
in
Liechtenstein
's
Frankfurt
branch
.

He
said
he
told
clients
to
buy
selected
West
German
blue
chips
after
they
fell
by
about
10
%
.

After
the
opening
was
delayed
30
minutes
because
of
the
crush
of
sell
orders
,
Frankfurt
's
normal
two-hour
trading
session
was
extended
75
minutes
to
handle
the
heavy
volume
.

``
The
beginning
was
chaotic
,
''
said
Nigel
Longley
,
a
broker
for
Commerzbank
AG
.

``
It
took
three-quarters
of
an
hour
before
enough
prices
could
be
worked
out
to
get
a
reading
on
the
market
.

''
Institutional
investors
and
bankers
,
many
of
whom
spent
the
night
before
in
their
offices
watching
Far
Eastern
markets
,
were
cautiously
optimistic
after
the
mild
1.8
%
decline
in
Tokyo
stock
prices
.

``
Everybody
was
still
confident
,
including
most
institutional
investors
.

That
is
why
everybody
was
a
little
surprised
by
the
storm
of
sell
orders
from
small
private
investors
,
''
said
Norbert
Braeuer
,
a
senior
trader
for
Hessische
Landesbank
.

Some
big
institutions
,
including
banks
,
began
picking
up
lower-priced
shares
late
yesterday
,
but
most
investors
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
in
New
York
before
acting
.

But
even
if
Wall
Street
continues
to
stabilize
,
analysts
here
say
the
latest
blow
to
investor
confidence
could
inhibit
a
swift
recovery
for
the
Frankfurt
exchange
,
which
already
was
showing
signs
of
weakness
after
the
DAX
had
slipped
from
a
1989
high
of
1657.61
on
Sept.
8
.

Some
of
West
Germany
's
bluest
chips
took
some
of
the
biggest
hits
.

A
16.3
%
drop
for
Mannesmann
AG
and
Dresdner
Bank
AG
's
9.6
%
decline
were
especially
problematic
for
their
respective
boards
,
whose
plans
for
major
rights
issues
in
November
could
now
be
in
jeopardy
.

Dresdner
Bank
last
month
said
it
hoped
to
raise
1.2
billion
marks
(
$
642.2
million
)
by
issuing
four
million
shares
at
300
marks
each
.

Yet
yesterday
's
market
cropped
Dresdner
's
share
price
by
33
marks
to
309
marks
a
share
,
leaving
little
incentive
for
investors
to
subscribe
to
the
standing
price
unless
the
market
recovers
quickly
.

LONDON
:
Headed
toward
a
record
drop
at
midday
,
the
London
stock
market
recouped
two-thirds
of
its
losses
in
the
wake
of
New
York
's
early
rally
.

The
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100
Share
Index
closed
off
70.5
points
,
at
2163.4
,
its
high
for
the
day
,
after
having
plunged
204.2
points
at
12:49
p.m
.

It
was
big
institutions
such
as
Norwich
Union
Insurance
Group
,
Scottish
Amicable
Investment
Managers
and
Standard
Life
Assurance
Co.
that
spearheaded
the
rally
.

Attracted
by
low
prices
and
encouraged
by
New
York
's
performance
,
they
scooped
up
equities
across
the
board
.

Volume
was
959.3
million
shares
,
more
than
triple
recent
levels
.

PARIS
:
Late
buying
gave
the
Paris
Bourse
a
parachute
after
its
free
fall
early
in
the
day
.

The
CAC
General
Index
ended
down
5.4
%
at
523.6
,
a
drop
of
29.6
points
from
Friday
.

``
There
was
a
volatility
in
the
market
that
I
have
never
seen
before
,
''
said
Michel
Vigier
,
a
partner
in
brokerage
firm
Cholet
Dupont
.

``
When
Wall
Street
turned
around
shortly
after
the
opening
,
there
was
panic
buying
in
Paris
.

''
Brokers
said
that
as
the
news
spread
that
Wall
Street
was
moving
up
,
traders
who
had
called
to
place
sell
orders
changed
their
line
in
mid-conversation
,
ordering
buys
instead
.

Trading
was
driven
primarily
by
small
investors
and
speculators
,
with
large
institutions
waiting
on
the
sidelines
until
late
in
the
day
.

When
Wall
Street
turned
,
however
,
the
big
boys
entered
the
market
,
looking
for
bargains
.

J.P.
Morgan
&
Co.
swung
to
a
loss
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
NCNB
Corp.
reported
net
income
more
than
doubled
,
and
Security
Pacific
Corp.
net
rose
10
%
.

J.P.
Morgan
&
Co
.

J.P.
Morgan
,
as
expected
,
posted
a
$
1.82
billion
net
loss
for
the
quarter
,
reflecting
the
New
York
bank
's
decision
last
month
to
add
$
2
billion
to
reserves
for
losses
on
loans
to
less-developed
countries
.

The
reserve
addition
placed
the
parent
of
Morgan
Guaranty
Trust
Co.
among
a
few
major
U.S.
banks
that
have
covered
nearly
all
their
medium
and
long-term
portfolios
to
less-developed
countries
with
reserves
.

The
latest
quarter
's
loss
equals
$
9.92
a
share
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
Morgan
earned
$
233.6
million
,
or
$
1.25
a
share
.

George
M.
Salem
,
analyst
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
,
called
the
results
``
mildly
disappointing
.

''
Excluding
the
$
2
billion
provision
and
allowing
for
the
taxes
Morgan
paid
,
earnings
were
about
65
cents
a
share
,
Mr.
Salem
said
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
yesterday
,
Morgan
climbed
$
1.50
a
share
to
$
44.125
.

Net
interest
income
sank
27
%
in
the
quarter
to
$
254
million
from
$
347
million
.

The
interest
rate
on
short-term
funds
,
which
banks
borrow
to
finance
longer-term
loans
to
customers
,
was
``
sharply
higher
,
''
Morgan
said
.

Morgan
received
$
2
million
of
interest
payments
on
its
medium
and
long-term
Brazilian
loans
;
had
they
been
accruing
interest
,
net
interest
income
would
have
been
$
35
million
higher
in
the
quarter
,
Morgan
said
.

Such
loans
to
Argentina
also
remain
classified
as
non-accruing
,
costing
the
bank
$
10
million
of
interest
income
in
the
third
period
.

Income
from
sources
other
than
interest
climbed
12
%
to
$
414
million
,
reflecting
higher
corporate-finance
and
other
fees
and
gains
on
sales
of
investment
securities
.

``
These
increases
were
partly
offset
by
lower
trading-related
''
income
,
the
bank
said
.

Non-interest
expenses
grew
16
%
to
$
496
million
.

NCNB
Corp
.

NCNB
Corp.
's
net
income
more
than
doubled
in
the
period
,
largely
because
of
continued
strong
performance
by
the
bank
's
Texas
operations
.

The
Charlotte
,
N.C.
,
company
said
earnings
rose
to
$
143.6
million
,
or
$
1.45
a
share
,
from
$
58.9
million
,
or
69
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
56.1
million
,
or
59
cents
a
share
,
related
to
the
purchase
of
the
remaining
51
%
of
NCNB
Texas
National
Bank
from
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp
.

The
strong
performance
,
however
,
contrasted
with
an
unexpectedly
large
increase
in
the
size
of
NCNB
's
problem
loans
,
particularly
in
the
Southeast
.

In
the
third
quarter
,
nonperforming
assets
jumped
to
$
474.1
million
,
or
1.43
%
of
net
loans
and
leases
,
from
$
232.8
million
,
or
1.13
%
in
the
second
quarter
.

Nonperformers
totaled
$
230.8
million
,
or
1.27
%
in
the
year-ago
third
quarter
.

Included
in
the
increase
in
the
most
recent
quarter
is
a
$
33
million
loan
,
which
NCNB
said
it
``
expects
to
be
fully
repaid
,
with
no
loss
,
early
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

The
deterioration
in
credit
quality
offset
strong
loan
growth
of
17
%
in
NCNB
's
Southeast
operations
,
as
well
as
a
28
%
growth
in
deposits
resulting
from
an
aggressive
marketing
campaign
.

The
higher
rates
paid
on
deposits
also
helped
squeeze
NCNB
's
net
interest
margin
in
the
Southeast
to
3.38
%
from
3.80
%
a
year
earlier
.

In
Big
Board
composite
trading
yesterday
,
NCNB
jumped
$
3.50
a
share
,
to
$
51
.

Results
were
released
after
the
market
closed
.

NCNB
Texas
National
,
formed
from
the
remnants
of
of
the
failed
First
RepublicBank
Corp.
of
Dallas
,
contributed
$
76.9
million
to
NCNB
's
bottom
line
in
the
third
quarter
.

NCNB
said
its
third-quarter
results
reflect
100
%
of
earnings
of
the
Texas
operation
since
Aug.
1
.

NCNB
raised
some
$
1.9
billion
in
new
capital
during
the
quarter
to
complete
the
NCNB
Texas
purchase
,
and
to
acquire
several
small
failed
thrifts
to
fill
out
its
regional
franchise
.

Last
week
,
the
banking
company
said
it
purchased
both
Freedom
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
and
University
Federal
Savings
Association
of
San
Antonio
,
Texas
,
for
$
169.4
million
.

In
the
first
nine
months
,
NCNB
's
net
income
climbed
65
%
to
$
310.9
million
,
or
$
3.30
a
share
,
from
$
188.2
million
,
or
$
2.22
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Security
Pacific
Corp
.

Security
Pacific
's
earnings
growth
slowed
in
the
third
quarter
,
but
the
Los
Angeles
bank
holding
company
was
still
able
to
post
a
10
%
increase
in
net
income
because
of
robust
growth
in
residential
real-estate
and
consumer
loans
.

Net
rose
to
$
185.1
million
,
or
$
1.55
a
share
,
from
$
167.9
million
,
or
$
1.47
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
company
said
the
gain
resulted
mainly
from
a
$
54
million
increase
in
net
interest
income
,
reflecting
a
33
%
increase
in
real
estate
loans
(
mainly
residential
)
,
and
a
19
%
rise
in
consumer
loans
.

These
high-yielding
loans
in
effect
replaced
some
low-yielding
assets
such
as
inter-bank
loans
,
which
were
allowed
to
decrease
.

As
a
result
,
Security
Pacific
's
net
interest
margin
fell
only
13
basis
points
,
a
more
mild
decrease
than
some
major
banks
outside
California
,
which
have
been
reporting
more
sluggish
earnings
.

Security
Pacific
shares
closed
at
$
44.625
,
down
37.5
cents
,
in
Big
Board
composite
trading
.

The
earnings
represent
a
0.89
%
return
on
assets
for
Security
Pacific
,
and
an
18.9
%
return
on
equity
.

The
loan
growth
offset
continuing
real-estate
loan
losses
in
the
depressed
Arizona
market
.

Security
Pacific
reported
a
33
%
increase
in
net
credit
losses
for
the
quarter
,
to
$
109
million
from
$
81.9
million
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Nonperforming
loans
grew
slightly
to
$
1.75
billion
at
Sept.
30
,
from
$
1.7
billion
a
year
ago
.

Security
Pacific
's
loan-loss
provision
was
down
22
%
,
or
$
30.4
million
,
because
it
added
to
its
foreign-debt
reserve
the
year
before
.

Non-interest
income
fell
6
%
in
the
quarter
,
mainly
because
of
an
unusual
gain
a
year
earlier
from
the
sale
of
Hong
Kong
banking
operations
.

Non-interest
expense
grew
only
4
%
in
the
period
.

For
the
nine
months
,
net
rose
17
%
to
$
548.9
million
,
or
$
4.67
a

,
from

LIN
Broadcasting
Corp.
said
it
wo
n't
take
a
position
on
a
revised
tender
offer
by
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
Inc.
to
buy
LIN
and
has
asked
for
clarification
of
the
offer
.

The
new
offer
,
which
seeks
50.3
%
of
the
cellular
and
broadcasting
concern
,
is
for
$
125
a
share
for
22
million
LIN
shares
.

McCaw
's
revised
tender
offer
would
require
McCaw
to
begin
an
auction
process
in
July
1994
that
would
buy
out
remaining
holders
at
a
per-share
price
roughly
equivalent
to
what
a
third
party
might
then
have
to
pay
for
all
of
LIN
.

LIN
is
asking
McCaw
to
clarify
its
tender
offer
,
which
challenges
an
agreement
between
BellSouth
Corp.
and
LIN
to
merge
their
cellular-telephone
businesses
.

BellSouth
has
notified
LIN
that
it
would
``
shortly
respond
to
the
McCaw
proposal
in
as
full
and
effective
a
manner
as
is
warranted
.

''
The
LIN
board
said
holders
may
be
misled
by
the
provision
in
the
McCaw
proposal
that
``
guarantees
''
private
market
value
after
five
years
for
the
remaining
shares
.

McCaw
has
``
no
obligation
to
purchase
and
the
definition
of
private
market
value
is
uncertain
,
''
the
LIN
board
said
.

The
board
added
that
McCaw
would
be
able
to
control
LIN
's
operations
and
could
,
``
therefore
,
operate
LIN
in
a
manner
which
could
diminish
its
private
market
value
and
attractiveness
to
a
third-party
purchaser
in
five
years
.

''
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
said
the
first
dispute-settlement
panel
set
up
under
the
U.S.-Canadian
``
free
trade
''
agreement
has
ruled
that
Canada
's
restrictions
on
exports
of
Pacific
salmon
and
herring
violate
the
accord
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
the
U.S.
and
Canada
have
until
Nov.
13
to
resolve
the
dispute
.

If
a
solution
is
n't
reached
by
then
,
she
said
,
the
U.S.
would
have
the
right
to
suspend
some
trade
concessions
to
Canada
equivalent
in
value
to
the
losses
suffered
by
U.S.
fish-processing
companies
in
Alaska
and
the
Pacific
Northwest
.

However
,
in
Ottawa
,
Canadian
Trade
Minister
John
Crosbie
said
the
dispute-settlement
panel
accepted
the
``
legitimacy
of
Canada
's
position
on
the
use
of
these
landing
requirements
to
conserve
and
manage
these
important
fisheries
.

''
Questioned
about
the
seeming
contradiction
in
the
U.S.
and
Canadian
government
views
of
the
panel
's
report
,
an
aide
for
Mrs.
Hills
said
the
panel
had
clearly
ruled
that
the
Canadian
trade
restrictions
``
are
illegal
.

''
The
U.S.
trade
representative
declined
to
put
a
dollar
estimate
on
the
losses
resulting
from
the
Canadian
export
restrictions
.

Canada
initially
had
an
export
prohibition
that
was
replaced
by
regulations
requiring
that
such
fish
had
to
be
brought
ashore
in
British
Columbia
by
commercial
fishermen
prior
to
export
.

This
action
was
defended
by
the
Canadian
government
on
conservation
grounds
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
yesterday
that
the
dispute-settlement
panel
rejected
this
Canadian
government
argument
.

``
We
fully
expect
that
Canada
will
comply
with
the
panel
's
ruling
''
that
the
``
landing
requirement
''
also
must
be
ended
,
she
said
.

Earlier
,
an
international
panel
set
up
under
the
rules
of
the
General
Agreement
on
Tariffs
and
Trade
in
Geneva
determined
that
the
original
Canadian
fish-export
restrictions
violated
GATT
rules
.

Mrs.
Hills
said
the
U.S.
wo
n't
accept
any
delays
after
Nov.
13
because
U.S.
fish-processing
firms
enter
into
contracts
in
the
fall
to
purchase
the
next
season
's
catch
.

She
said
the
Canadian
restrictions
must
be
removed
before
such
contracts
are
concluded
.

agreement
previously
agreed
to
by
the
Federal

Corp.
,
creditor
banks

The
plan
would

its
bank
and
debenture
obligations
through
exchanges
of
cash
and

The
market
upheaval
apparently
has
n't
triggered
any
cash
crunch
--
yet
.

Individual
investors
,
investment
firms
and
arbitragers
who
speculate
in
the
stocks
of
takeover
candidates
can
suffer
liquidity
and
payment
problems
when
stocks
dive
;
those
investors
often
borrow
heavily
to
buy
their
holdings
and
use
the
stocks
as
collateral
for
loans
.

But
several
large
banks
said
yesterday
they
detected
no
signs
of
unusual
demand
for
credit
that
would
signal
such
difficulties
.

``
We
're
seeing
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
''
said
one
official
at
a
Top
10
bank
.

``
That
's
good
news
,
because
we
all
swim
in
this
water
.

''
Added
another
executive
at
a
big
bank
:
``
We
were
all
a
little
goosey
over
the
weekend
trying
to
forecast
what
would
happen
{
Monday
}
,
but
it
's
been
very
quiet
.

Now
,
as
for
tomorrow
,
hell
,
who
knows
?
''
What
happened
Friday
shows
that
financial
markets
are
not
yet
sufficiently
coordinated
to
handle
another
meltdown
in
prices
.

No
fiddling
with
systems
and
procedures
will
ever
prevent
markets
from
suffering
a
panic
wave
of
selling
.

But
markets
can
operate
with
greater
or
lesser
efficiency
.

After
the
1987
plunge
,
markets
agreed
that
it
would
be
wise
to
halt
trading
whenever
panic
conditions
arose
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
adopted
two
specific
circuit
breakers
:
If
the
Dow
Jones
index
falls
250
points
in
a
day
,
the
exchange
will
halt
trading
for
one
hour
;
if
the
decline
hits
400
points
,
the
exchange
will
close
for
an
additional
two
hours
.

The
rationale
is
that
an
interruption
of
trading
will
allow
investors
to
reconsider
their
strategies
,
calm
sellers
and
lead
buyers
to
enter
the
market
at
indicated
new
price
levels
.

It
is
impossible
to
know
whether
that
theory
is
realistic
.

A
temporary
cessation
of
trading
may
indeed
discourage
a
selling
panic
from
feeding
on
itself
.

But
there
is
also
the
possibility
that
shutting
down
markets
will
intensify
fears
and
cause
an
even
more
abrupt
slide
in
prices
.

What
happened
Friday
was
the
worst
of
all
worlds
.

The
futures
exchanges
followed
their
own
pre-set
circuit
breakers
and
shut
down
at
about
3
p.m.
for
30
minutes
,
after
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
stock
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
or
about
100
points
on
the
Dow
Jones
index
.

Options
markets
stopped
trading
in
many
securities
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
under
its
own
rules
,
remained
open
.

With
nowhere
else
to
go
,
sellers
,
and
particularly
program
traders
,
focused
all
their
selling
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

As
liquidity
on
that
market
weakened
,
prices
fell
sharply
.

Had
the
futures
and
options
markets
been
open
,
additional
liquidity
would
have
been
provided
and
the
decline
,
most
probably
,
would
have
been
less
intense
.

At
3:30
,
after
intense
telephone
negotiations
between
the
trading
markets
and
Washington
,
the
futures
exchanges
reopened
.

Futures
trading
,
however
,
was
halted
altogether
at
3:45
,
after
the
futures
markets
had
dropped
an
additional
30
points
,
which
is
the
daily
limit
for
price
declines
.

At
this
point
,
the
options
markets
also
shut
down
and
once
more
left
all
sales
to
be
handled
by
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

It
is
time
to
recognize
that
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
the
futures
markets
and
the
options
markets
,
though
physically
separate
,
have
actually
become
so
closely
intertwined
as
to
constitute
one
market
effectively
.

Traders
can
vary
their
strategies
and
execute
their
orders
in
any
one
of
them
.

It
therefore
makes
no
sense
for
each
market
to
adopt
different
circuit
breakers
.

To
achieve
maximum
liquidity
and
minimize
price
volatility
,
either
all
markets
should
be
open
to
trading
or
none
.

Synchronized
circuit
breakers
would
not
have
halted
the
slide
in
prices
on
Friday
,
but
they
probably
would
have
made
for
smoother
,
less
volatile
executions
.

It
's
time
for
the
exchanges
and
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
to
agree
on
joint
conditions
for
halting
trading
or
staying
open
.

Let
's
not
have
one
market
shut
down
for
30
minutes
when
the
Dow
declines
100
points
and
another
shut
down
for
an
hour
after
a
250-point
decline
.

The
need
for
hurried
last-minute
telephone
negotiations
among
market
officials
will
disappear
once
rules
are
in
place
that
synchronize
circuit
breakers
in
all
markets
.

The
new
circuit
breakers
,
if
they
are
to
be
applied
at
all
,
will
require
that
futures
and
options
trading
continue
as
long
as
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
remains
open
.

The
rules
should
be
established
by
agreement
of
the
officials
of
all
affected
exchanges
acting
under
the
oversight
and
with
the
approval
of
the
government
regulatory
agencies
.

Should
the
SEC
and
the
Commodities
Futures
Trading
Commission
(
which
,
with
the
SEC
,
regulates
the
Chicago
stock-index
markets
)
be
unable
to
agree
,
the
issue
may
have
to
be
resolved
by
decision
of
the
Treasury
secretary
.

In
many
ways
,
our
financial
markets
are
better
prepared
today
to
handle
a
decline
than
they
were
two
years
ago
.

The
New
York
Stock
Exchange
now
has
the
capacity
to
handle
a
volume
of
nearly
a
billion
shares
a
day
.

Telephone
service
has
been
improved
for
customers
trying
to
reach
their
brokers
,
and
specialists
--
who
I
believe
should
stay
,
despite
the
urgings
of
some
post-crash
critics
--
have
larger
capital
positions
.

(
Of
course
,
specialists
'
actions
alone
can
never
prevent
a
major
crack
in
stock
prices
.

Witness
the
fact
that
trading
in
some
stocks
closed
early
Friday
and
opened
late
Monday
because
of
an
excess
of
sell
orders
.

)
But
the
task
of
improving
market
performance
remains
unfinished
.

Mr.
Freund
,
former
chief
economist
of

A
UNIFIED
EUROPE
poses
labor
problems
and
prospects
for
U.S.
firms
.

The
``
social
dimension
''
--
worker
concerns
--
of
the
European
Community
's
plan
to
open
its
internal
borders
in
1992
could
set
the
effort
``
off
the
rails
''
if
not
done
reasonably
,
says
General
Electric
senior
vice
president
Frank
Doyle
.

U.S.
companies
wanting
to
expand
in
Europe
face
``
tough
pressure
''
from
unions
in
nations
such
as
West
Germany
,
which
play
a
big
consulting
role
in
management
decisions
,
he
says
.

FMC
Corp.
and
Baxter
International
say
unions
also
wo
n't
like
plant
relocations
and
needed
restructuring
,
which
means
layoffs
.

Many
employers
have
already
begun
moving
to
southern
countries
such
as
Spain
and
Italy
,
where
wages
are
low
and
unions
are
weaker
;
demand
for
trained
labor

will
rise
there

CLUBBING
A
FAN
was
n't
the
Baltimore
Orioles
'
fault
.

So
said
a
federal
judge
,
in
a
case
involving
two
players
for
the
minor
league
Bluefield
,
Va.
,
Orioles
,
a
Baltimore
farm
team
.

The
players
were
heckled
by
a
patron
during
a
July
4
,
1988
,
game
with
the
Martinsville
Phillies
.

Like
its
parent
that
year
,
``
Bluefield
was
not
having
a
good
year
,
''
the
judge
said
.

After
the
game
(
``
Bluefield
lost
,
9-8
,
stranding
three
runners
in
...
the
ninth
,
''
he
noted
)
,
trouble
began
.

More
taunting
in
the
parking
lot
,
the
players
said
,
led
to
a
fight
.

The
fan
said
he
was
punched
and
kicked
by
one
player
and
that
the
other
broke
his
jaw
with
a
baseball
bat
.

The
judge
dismissed
the
fan
's
suit
against
the
team
,
however
,
ruling
the
Orioles
innocent
of
negligent
hiring
,
and
not
responsible
for
a
fight
that
was
outside
the
players
'
employment
.

PROPOSALS
ARISE
for
coping
with
the
shortage
of
nurses
.

An
Association
of
Academic
Health
Centers
report
urges
freeing
nurses
from
duties
that
do
n't
require
special
skills
.

It
also
recommends
better
retirement
and
day-care
benefits
,
and
basing
pay
on
education
,
experience
and
nurses
'
demanding
work
schedules
.

But
it
opposes
an
American
Medical
Association
proposal
for
creating
a
``
registered
care
technologist
,
''
as
``
potentially
divisive
''
;
it
says
the
job
would
entail
an
unwanted
new
doctor
's
``
bedside
''
extension
.

Over
a
third
of
618
hospitals
surveyed
by
consultant
Hewitt
Associates
use
a
``
clinical
ladder
,
''
basing
advancement
on
performance
and
education
.

Many
also
use
recruiting
bonuses
,
tuition
reimbursement
,
loan
repayment
or
child-care
help
.

Some
give
lump-sum
incentives
.

MRA

Systems

annual
income
up

TREATING
EMPLOYEES
with
respect
is
crucial
for
managers
,
says
consultant
Hay
Group
after
surveys
of
a
million
workers
.

It
's
in
their
top
five
``
work
values
.

''
Fully
80
%
of
employees
who
say
their
bosses
treat
them
with
respect
,
but
only
a
third
of
those
who
do
n't
feel
respected
say
they
're
satisfied
with
where
they
work
.

the

of

Services
says
;
its
survey
of

such
employees
shows
82
%
with
more
than
a
high-school
education
,
and
31
%
with

degrees
.

About
12

LOSSES
rise
,
but
they
're
often

But

damage
.

A
third

439
companies
surveyed
by
the
Employee
Relocation
Council
report
a
rise
in
1988
sales

over
1987
.

About
72
%
reimburse
for
all
or
some
losses
.

Since
1984
,
more
companies
give
sales-loss
aid
,
as
many
real-estate
values
depreciated
,
the
council
says
.

RJR

up
to
$
30,000

,
including

.

Goodrich
wo
n't

coverage

but
will
prevent

``

;
it
has
given
some
employees
the
full

price
when

Since

rose

When

Big

self-congratulatory
about

They

the

better

``

Mr.

said
after

closed

``
All

we
set
up

Prices

carried
on

officials
said
.

While
reaching

proportions
yesterday
,
the

was
still
well
within
the

capacity
that

has
said
it

complaints
,
Mr.

said
the

with

Chicken
Chains
Ruffled
By
Loss
of
Customers
FAST-FOOD
chicken
chains
,
faced
with
a
worsening
business
slump
,
are
struggling
to
hatch
some
new
marketing
strategies
.

The
Crest
Report
,
which
tracks
consumer
purchases
,
says
customer
traffic
at
chicken
restaurants
fell
10
%
in
the
second
quarter
,
while
the
overall
fast-food
customer
count
was
down
2
%
.

Chicken
business
is
off
largely
because
of
more
competition
from
grocery-store
convenience
food
,
home-delivered

fare

spokesman
for

tested
the
sale
of
individual
pieces
of
chicken

New
management
at
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
,
a
unit
of
PepsiCo
Inc.
,
has
fought
back
with
new
medium
and
large
chicken
sandwiches
for
the
lunch
crowd
.

And
the
chain
is
testing
products
that
are
n't
fried
,
such
as
``
char-grilled
''
chicken
,
to
try
to
win
health-conscious
consumers
.

Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
also
is
testing
home-delivery
of
chicken
,
which
could
be
a
hit
with
stay-at-home
diners
.

But
some
fast-food
industry
analysts
say
problems
with
keeping
chicken
warm
and
fresh
must
be
solved
first
.

A
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
spokesman
,
however
,
disputed
the
notion
that
the
delivery
service
experienced
problems
in
some
markets
where
testing
has
been
discontinued
.

He
says
the
test
is
continuing
in
Chicago
,
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
and
a
few
other
cities
.

The
advertising
industry
is
buzzing
with
rumors
that
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
will
drop
Young
&
Rubicam
and
seek
a
new
ad
agency
.

But
the
company
declines
to
comment
.

Emanuel
Goldman
,
a
PaineWebber
Inc.
analyst
,
predicts
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
will
post
an
11
%
drop
in
1989
net
income
.

``
They
've
been
laggard

he
says
,
``
but
they
'll
have
to
become
more
aggressive

Reluctant

un-advertising

Pittsburgh
consultant
David
Bear
is
selling
a
soft
approach
to
clients
who
want
exposure
yet
shun
pushy
ads
.

His
ploy
:
60-second
radio
spots
that
offer
helpful
hints
.

The
only
plug
for
the
sponsor
is
a
brief
mention
at
the
end
of
the
spot
.

The
messages
resemble
the
Business
Traveler
,
a
daily
dose
of
travel
tips
developed
by
Mr.
Bear
and
sponsored
by
travel
agencies
in
several
major

.

New
un-advertisers
include
Burt

Kosar
Rittlemann

a

Its

features
such
spots
as
``
Floodlights
:
Evening
Wear

''
and
``
Building

''
A
harder
sell

says
John
Kosar
,
the

would
``
detract

''
Hospitals
have
signed
up

use
the

to
promote
fundraisers
,
and
Equitable
Gas
Co.
is
considering
the
format
to
offer
energy
tips
to
consumers
.

But
such
spots
can
be
too
soft
.

``
There
's
always
a
risk
of
lost

,
''
says
John
Fitzgerald
,
chairman
of
Ketchum
Advertising

created
similar
radio

Retailer
Sees
Pitfalls
In
Environmental
Push
HERE
'S
a
retailer
that
's
getting
tough
in
the
push
for
environmentally
safe
packaging
and
products
.

Big
Bear
Supermarkets
Inc.
,
a
grocery
chain
based
in
San
Diego
,
plans
to
display
shelf
cards
and
distribute
pamphlets
recommending
products
deemed
safe
for
the
environment
.

The
choices
will
be
based
on
research
by
the
San
Diego
Environmental
Health
Coalition
and
will
include
products
like
Murphy
's
Oil
Soap
and
other
noncorrosive
cleaners
.

But
the
chain
is
quickly
realizing
the
pitfalls
of
such
endorsements
.

For
example
,
it
recommends
nonchlorinated
dishwasher
detergent
and
puts
Sunlight
on
its
environmentally
safe
list
.

That
does
n't
thrill
Procter
&
Gamble
Co.
,
maker
of
Cascade
dishwasher
detergent
.

A
company
spokesman
questioned
the
validity
of
the
list
,
noting
that
chlorine
is
present
in
all
major
dishwasher
detergents
.

In
fact
,
Lever
Bros.
confirms
that
its
Sunlight
brand
does
contain
chlorine
bleach
,
even
though
it
is
n't
listed
on
the
label
for
the
powder
version
.

Thomas
G.
Dahlen
,
Big
Bear
's
executive
vice
president
,
said
the
chain
is
still
reviewing
its
product
list
to
avoid
such
problems
.

``
Our
intent
is
to
promote
the
best
alternative
,
''
he
says
.

``
And
it
's
important
that
we
be
accurate
.

''
But
in
the
end
,
customers
'
wishes
are
what
will
prevail
.

Big
Bear
does
n't
care
for
disposable
diapers
,
which
are
n't
biodegradable
.

Yet
parents
demand
them
.

Says
Mr.
Dahlen
,
``
We
'll
still
be
forced
to
sell
items
we
might
not
philosophically
agree
with

Secretary

has
chosen

Bush

said

If
she
is
nominated
by
President

and
confirmed

,
Dr.
Novello
would
succeed
C.
Everett
Koop
,
who
rattled
liberals
and
conservatives
alike
with
his
outspoken
views
on
a
range
of
health
issues

Dr.

,
an
expert
on

,
is
deputy
director
of
the
National

of

Health
and

.

She
has
also
served

forces

Dr.
Novello
's
office
said
she
would
n't
talk
with
reporters
,
and
it
refused
to
release
any
information
about
her
.

The
newsletter
Medicine
&
Health
,
which
first
disclosed
her
selection
by
Dr.
Sullivan
,
said
she
is
44
years
old
and
she
studied
at
the
University
of
Puerto
Rico
School
of
Medicine
.

The
continuing
series
of
HUD
scandals
is
a
sadly
predictable
result
of
pork-barrel
politics
.

Nevertheless
,
lobbies
such
as
the
National
Association
of
Home
Builders
(
NAHB
)
continue
to
pressure
Capitol
Hill
for
more
special-interest
spending
.

Kent
Colton
,
NAHB
executive
vice
president
,
argues
that
the
U.S.
faces
a
multifaceted
housing
crisis
--
reduced
affordability
of
homes
for
first-time
buyers
,
increased
homelessness
,
and
lower
apartment
construction
rates
--
that
will
be
``
very
difficult
''
to
solve
``
without
expanded
federal
resources
.

''
There
's
nothing
unusual
about
business
groups
pushing
for
more
government
spending
.

But
the
NAHB
was
created
in
1943
out
of
an
organization
that
made
its
name
fighting
a
Roosevelt
administration
proposal
to
take
over
all
defense
housing
production
.

Through
the
years
the
association
has
been
an
active
member
of
the
taxpayer
's
coalition
,
pushing
for
such
initiatives
as
the
balanced-budget
amendment
.

Yet
on
matters
close
to
,
er
,
home
...
``
The
HUD
budget
has
dropped
by
more
than
70
%
since
1980
,
''
argues
Mr.
Colton
.

``
We
've
taken
more
than
our
fair
share
.

I
would
n't
have
a
problem
if
other
programs
had
taken
a
similar
hit
.

''
But
NAHB
support
for
subsidies
is
not
related
to
the
current
housing
crunch
;
over
the
years
the
NAHB
has
backed
a
host
of
public
programs
.

It
once
pushed
for
a
national
housing
production
goal
set
by
the
federal
government
and
has
regularly
advanced
anti-recession
housing
measures
.

Moreover
,
explains
one
HUD
official
,
the
NAHB
remains
susceptible
to
internal
pressure
from
members
that
specialize
in
subsidized
production
.

The
association
is
pushing
an
extensive
and
expensive
wish-list
,
which
would
substantially
boost
spending
above
the
current
level
of
more
than
$
15
billion
annually
.

It
would
like
to
peg
the
ceiling
on
Federal
Housing
Administration
mortgage
guarantees
to
95
%
of
the
median
price
in
a
particular
market
,
instead
of
limiting
it
to
$
101,250
;
reduce
(
or
even
eliminate
)
FHA
down-payment
requirements
and
increase
the
availability
of
variable-rate
mortgages
;
expand
the
Veterans
Affairs
Department
loan
guarantee
program
;
provide
``
adequate
''
funding
for
the
Farmers
Home
Administration
(
FmHA
)
;
increase
federal
funding
and
tax
incentives
for
the
construction
of
low-income
and
rental
housing
,
including
$
4
billion
in
block
grants
to
states
and
localities
;
and
``
fully
fund
''
the
McKinney
Act
,
a
$
656
million
potpourri
for
the
homeless
.

Direct
federal
subsidies
for
housing
construction
have
proved
intolerably
expensive
in
the
past
,
and
inevitably
are
twisted
to
the
benefit
of
well-connected
developers
and
lobbyists
,
as
demonstrated
by
the
ongoing
HUD
scandal
,
or
congressmen
.

Indirect
subsidies
,
through
the
FHA
,
for
instance
,
are
little
better
.

Though
Mr.
Colton
says
expanding
FHA
lending
would
result
in
``
no
cost
to
the
government
,
''
the
mere
diversion
of
funds
from
other
parts
of
the
economy
and
from
other
forms
of
housing
(
such
as
low-income
)
to
the
single-family
home
market
would
result
in
a
major
expense
.

More
important
,
housing
programs
run
by
HUD
,
the
VA
,
and
FmHA
are
awash
in
red
ink
.

The
FHA
alone
lost
$
4.2
billion
in
fiscal
1988
;
the
government
's
equity
in
the
agency
,
essentially
its
reserve
fund
,
fell
to
minus
$
2.9
billion
.

The
federal
government
has
had
to
pump
in
$
2.28
billion
into
the
VA
housing
program
since
1984
to
keep
the
fund
afloat
and
the
VA
requested
an
additional
$
120
million
for
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
.

All
told
,
the
federal
government
already
guarantees
more
than
$
900
billion
of
mortgages
.

In
its
nicely
produced
publication
``
Where
Will
Our
Children
Live
?
''
the
NAHB
does
acknowledge
that
``
of
course
,
the
full
measure
of
housing
affordability
can
not
be
provided
by
the
federal
government
.

''
It
points
to
the
pernicious
impact
of
local
government
regulation
,
particularly
zoning
and
building
fees
,
which
pushes
the
price
of
housing
out
of
the
reach
of
low-
and
middle-income
people
.

But
while
the
NAHB
has
suggested
actions
that
states
and
localities
should
take
to
reduce
regulatory
barriers
,
the
association
has
proposed
no
activist
legislative
program
--
comparable
to
,
say
,
its
detailed
request
for
more
federal
subsidies
--
to
eliminate
counterproductive
controls
.

The
association
,
a
majority
of
whose
156,000
members
build
fewer
than
25
units
a
year
,
is
like
many
other
business
lobbies
.

Explains
Sheila
MacDonald
of
the
National
Taxpayers
Union
:
``
It
treads
in
two
worlds
.

The
builders
like
the
subsidies
,
but
at
the
same
time
they
tend
to
be
fiscal
conservatives
in
terms
of
major
issues
,
such
as
the
balanced-budget
amendment
.

''
Unfortunately
,
the
organization
's
desire
for
pork
tends
to
override
its
commitment
to
overall
fiscal
responsibility
.

Two
years
ago
when
the
NAHB
lobbied
for
the
$
19
billion
omnibus
housing
bill
,
the
organization
``
basically
dropped
out
of
the
taxpayers
'
coalition
,
''
says
Ms.
MacDonald
.

As
Mr.
Colton
of
the
NAHB
acknowledges
:
``
Government
is
not
going
to
solve
the
problem
...
.

The
real
key
is
to
have
the
economy
working
and
interest
rates
down
.

''
More
money
for
HUD
will
increase
the
deficit
and
destabilize
the
economy
;
more
money
to
municipalities
that
are
wrecking
their
local
housing
markets
will
further
insulate
them
from
the
destructive
effects
of
their
policies
.

Is
this
what
the
home
builders
want
?

)
In
an
attempt
to
give
new
momentum
to
European
Community
plans
for
a
single
currency
,
EC
government
leaders
are
likely
to
agree
to
set
a
date
for
starting
formal
talks
on
amending
the
EC
's
founding
Treaty
of
Rome
.

According
to
diplomatic
sources
in
Brussels
,
most
EC
leaders
agree
that
talks
should
begin
in
the
second
half
of
1990
,
and
will
make
a
declaration
on
that
during
a
summit
meeting
in
Strasbourg
,
France
,
on
Dec.
8
and
9
.

The
only
strong
opposition
to
changing
the
EC
treaty
comes
from
British
Prime
Minister
Margaret
Thatcher
,
who
is
opposed
to
creating
a
single
EC
currency
.

But
the
process
of
convening
the
intergovernmental
conference
does
n't
require
unanimity
.

Setting
a
date
to
start
treaty
negotiations
has
no
legal
significance
in
itself
,
but
could
be
viewed
as
an
important
psychological
push
.

French
President
Francois
Mitterrand
fought
to
set
a
date
for
the
conference
during
the
EC
summit
in
Madrid
last
June
,
but
the
move
was
scuttled
because
of
opposition
by
Mrs.
Thatcher
and
West
German
Chancellor
Helmut
Kohl
.

Diplomatic
sources
said
Mr.
Kohl
may
now
agree
to
set
a
date
for
the
conference
to
make
it
clear
that
West
Germany
is
still
committed
to
EC
unity
.

The
latest
crewcut
in
the
equities
markets
reminds
me
of
the
joke
T.
Boone
Pickens
tells
about
the
guy
who
was
run
over
by
the
parade
.

When
asked
``
What
went
wrong
?
''
the
unfortunate
victim
replied
,
``
It
was
a
combination
of
things
.

''
And
so
it
was
on
Gray
Friday
.

The
grand
marshal
of
this
parade
would
appear
to
have
been
excess
leverage
.

Even
if
that
is
so
,
however
,
it
's
probably
the
case
that
no
barriers
should
have
been
erected
to
stop
the
procession
before
the
end
of
the
rout
(
e
)
.

The
ceremonies
began
Friday
afternoon
when
word
spread
that
the
UAL
buy-out
was
collapsing
.

Although
the
union-bidder
expects
to
patch
together
a
substitute
offer
,
consisting
of
less
cash
,
the
failure
to
get
cash
from
Japanese
and
American
banks
confirmed
a
growing
fear
among
arbitragers
that
the
pageant
of
high-leverage
takeover
deals
is
ending
.

Lots
of
other
entries
made
up
the
parade
,
of
course
--
notably
a
surprisingly
large
increase
in
producer
prices
,
signalling
Federal
Reserve
tightness
;
and
the
Bush
administration
's
(
temporary
?
)
defeat
in
trying
to
lower
the
capital-gains
tax
.

As
usual
,
few
favorable
reviews
were
heard
for
that
ever-present
marching
band
of
program
traders
,
although
most
serious
studies
suggest
they
only
play
the
music
that
others
write
.

What
really
spooked
the
crowds
along
Wall
Street
,
however
,
was
the
sudden
concern
that
,
whatever
the
reason
,
the
pool
of
debt
capital
is
drying
up
.

Gray
Friday
reflects
a
panic
mainly
by
the
takeover
arbitragers
,
rather
than
the
small
investor
,
as
their
highly
margined
investments
in
the
``
deal
''
stocks
are
jeopardized
by
the
unexpected
drying
up
of
the
lubricant
for
deal
financing
.

Deal
stocks
led
the
market
down
as
they
absorbed
the
heaviest
losses
.

UAL
,
which
triggered
the
slide
,
opened
Monday
at
$
224
,
down
about
20
%
from
Thursday
's
close
.

AMR
opened
Monday
at
$
80
,
down
nearly
20
%
from
Thursday
's
close
.

(
Both
took
further
hits
yesterday
.

)
Hilton
lost
20
%
on
Friday
;
Paramount
lost
almost
11
%
.

A
careful
look
reveals
that
where
deal
financing
has
been
secured
,
the
target
's
stock
price
was
not
affected
on
Friday
.

The
multibillion-dollar
prospects
,
where
the
bidder
must
line
up
a
consortium
of
banks
issue
billions
in
high-yield
debt
,
were
where
the
damage
was
concentrated
.

The
market
for
so-called
junk
bonds
has
been
setting
the
stage
for
Friday
's
dramatic
march
for
several
weeks
.

The
growing
financial
difficulties
of
recent
high-leverage
restructurings
or
takeovers
,
such
as
Resorts
International
,
Integrated
Resources
,
and
Campeau
's
retailing
empire
,
have
cast
a
pall
over
the
entire
market
for
high-yield
securities
.

Investors
have
reacted
by
ignoring
recent
efforts
to
float
junk
bonds
by
Ohio
Mattress
and
by
forcing
Ramada
to
postpone
indefinitely
its
planned
junk-bond
sale
and
restructuring
.

As
a
result
,
high-yield
mutual
funds
have
declined
across
the
board
and
the
many
firms
planning
to
sell
$
11
billion
in
junk
bonds
before
year-end
are
experiencing
anxious
times
.

These
are
all
market
excesses
(
putting
aside
the
artificial
boosts
that
the
tax
code
gives
to
debt
over
equity
)
,
and
what
we
've
seen
is
the
market
reining
them
in
.

Of
course
,
Washington
had
n't
been
silent
in
the
days
leading
up
to
the
debacle
,
and
its
tendency
to
meddle
in
the
leverage
equation
remains
a
troublesome
prospect
,
but
those
preliminary
steps
should
n't
distract
us
from
the
basic
market
fundamentalism
that
was
at
work
on
Friday
.

If
it
is
correct
to
find
that
concerns
over
corporate
debt
and
LBOs
caused
Gray
Friday
,
what
are
the
implications
for
policy
makers
?
After
all
,
the
stock
market
's
response
to
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
might
be
taken
to
confirm
the
anti-debt
direction
of
regulators
.

Is
this
a
case
where
private
markets
are
approving
of
Washington
's
bashing
of
Wall
Street
?
Absolutely
not
.

To
the
extent
that
Friday
's
sell-off
reflected
a
sudden
reappraisal
of
the
excesses
of
leverage
,
the
message
is
that
Wall
Street
and
the
private
markets
are
fully
capable
of
imposing
the
appropriate
incentives
and
sanctions
on
corporate
behavior
.

The
national
economic
interests
are
much
better
served
allowing
the
private
interests
of
bankers
and
investors
be
the
ultimate
judges
of
the
investment
quality
of
various
LBO
deals
and
leveraged
restructurings
.

The
recent
difficulties
in
the
junk-bond
markets
and
the
scarcity
of
bank
capital
for
recent
deals
underscores
the
wisdom
of
letting
the
free
markets
operate
.

If
takeover
premiums
become
excessive
,
if
LBO
dealmakers
become
too
aggressive
,
then
the
private
market
will
recognize
these
problems
more
quickly
and
accurately
than
will
policy
makers
,
and
the
markets
will
move
with
lightning
speed
to
impose
appropriate
sanctions
.

Yes
,
the
broader
exchanges
got
caught
up
in
the
spiral
,
but
they
rode
the
tiger
up
all
year
.

Not
surprisingly
,
he
sometimes
bites
.

The
arbitragers
and
takeover
initiatiors
got
killed
on
Gray
Friday
,
while
the
besieged
managers
of
prospective
targets
cheered
lustily
.

If
you
identify
with
the
besieged
managers
,
you
must
concede
that
speedy
and
effective
relief
from
the
excesses
of
the
takeover
market
is
more
likely
to
come
from
the
marketplace
than
from
Washington
.

If
you
side
with
the
arbitragers
and
raiders
,
you
clearly
have
more
to
fear
from
private
investors
than
from
regulators
,
although
the
Delaware
courts
should
never
be
underestimated
.

The
truth
is
,
Washington
understands
politics
better
than
economics
.

Although
the
average
citizen
is
probably
not
harmed
too
much
from
Washington
's
rhetorical
war
against
Wall
Street
regarding
excessive
financial
leveraging
,
actual
legislation
would
probably
impose
considerable
harm
.

Any
such
attempt
to
distinguish
``
good
debt
''
from
``
bad
debt
,
''
or
to
draw
the
line
at
a
particular
industry
,
such
as
the
airlines
,
is
likely
to
blunt
the
spur
that
the
proper
amount
of
leverage
provides
both
to
equity
markets
and
economic
efficiency
in
general
.

Far
better
for
policy
makers
to
concentrate
on
the
war
against
drugs
,
Panama
and
the
deficit
,
all
of
them
parades
that
seem
never
to
end
.

Tokyo
share
prices
rebounded
Tuesday
morning
,
with
the
Nikkei
index
of
225
selected
stocks
rising
618.69
points
to
close
the
morning
session
at
35087.38
.

The
index
slid
647.33
points
,
or
1.8
%
,
on
Monday
.

In
the
first
25
minutes
of
Tuesday
's
trading
the
Nikkei
index
soared
664.83
points
,
to
35133.83
.

By
10
a.m.
Tokyo
time
,
the
index
was
up
435.11
points
,
to
34903.80
as
investors
hailed
New
York
's
overnight
rally
.

Monday
's
slide
came
in
a
relatively
calm
session
that
did
n't
provide
much
direction
for
other
markets
.

Shares
also
closed
sharply
lower
across
Europe
,
particularly
in
Frankfurt
,
although
London
and
a
few
other
markets
recovered
some
ground
after
stocks
began
to
rebound
in
New
York
.

Other
Asian
and
Pacific
markets
had
sharper
losses
than
Tokyo
,
but
the
selling
wave
stopped
short
of
precipitating
another
market
crash
.

All
eyes
were
on
Tokyo
at
the
opening
because
it
was
the
first
major
market
to
trade
since
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
on
Wall
Street
.

But
rather
than
set
the
tone
for
other
markets
,
Japan
's
major
institutional
investors
chose
to
remain
on
the
sidelines
.

Still
,
despite
the
sudden
reappearance
of
stock-market
turbulence
,
managers
of
Japanese
investment
funds
said
they
were
n't
planning
to
unload
U.S.
or
European
equities
.

``
We
did
n't
trade
much
today
,
as
our
policy
now
is
to
wait
and
see
,
''
said
a
fund
manager
at
Taisho
Life
Insurance
Co
.

``
We
would
like
to
wait
and
see
until
trading
goes
around
through
Europe
and
New
York
.

''
The
institutions
appeared
confident
that
Japanese
regulators
would
step
in
to
ensure
orderly
trading
if
necessary
,
and
there
was
considerable
speculation
during
the
day
that
the
Finance
Ministry
was
working
behind
the
scenes
to
do
just
that
.

But
in
the
absence
of
panicky
trading
,
its
presence
was
never
overtly
felt
.

At
the
close
,
the
Nikkei
average
of
225
stocks
stood
at
34468.69
,
down
647.33
points
,
or
1.8
%
.

The
broader
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
sank
45.66
,
or
1.7
%
,
to
2600.88
.

The
day
's
decline
was
generally
in
line
with
analysts
'
weekend
predictions
.

Declining
issues
swamped
advancers
,
941-105
.

But
volume
was
thin
at
526.2
million
shares
,
compared
with
574.7
million
Friday
.

The
market
opened
sharply
lower
,
with
the
Nikkei
average
down
nearly
600
after
20
minutes
.

A
midmorning
rebound
brought
it
back
to
show
a
gain
of
about
200
at
the
end
of
the
morning
session
,
but
the
rally
failed
in
the
afternoon
,
and
the
market
closed
near
the
day
's
low
.

The
smaller
stocks
in
the
Tokyo
market
's
second
section
also
posted
their
biggest
decline
of
the
year
.

The
Tokyo
Stock
Exchange
index
for
the
second
section
fell
100.96
,
or
2.7
%
,
to
3655.40
.

Many
investors
,
trying
to
outperform
the
market
's
major
indexes
,
have
flocked
to
these
small
issues
in
recent
weeks
.

Japanese
investors
and
traders
expressed
relief
that
the
Tokyo
market
did
n't
fall
more
sharply
.

But
its
performance
did
bear
some
resemblance
to
events
of
two
years
ago
,
during
the
October
1987
global
stock
market
crash
.

On
Oct.
16
,
1987
--
the
Friday
before
the
Black
Monday
crash
--
the
New
York
market
dropped
4.6
%
,
and
Tokyo
followed
on
Monday
with
a
2.4
%
drop
.

This
time
,
Wall
Street
's
plunge
of
6.9
%
Friday
was
followed
by
yesterday
's
1.8
%
loss
in
Tokyo
.

Two
years
ago
,
Tokyo
's
biggest
fall
came
the
day
after
New
York
's
22.6
%
Black
Monday
plunge
,
when
the
Nikkei
average
fell
14.9
%
.

Thus
,
market
participants
yesterday
were
looking
ahead
nervously
to
Wall
Street
's
opening
.

But
in
New
York
yesterday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
surged
88.12
to
close
at
2657.38
on
heavy
volume
of
416,290,000
shares
,
although
declining
issues
still
outnumbered
advancing
ones
on
the
broad
market
.

Nobuto
Yasuda
,
a
director
at
Yamaichi
Investment
Trust
&
Management
Co.
,
called
yesterday
's
session
``
a
good
scenario
''
for
Japan
.

``
Now
we
are
looking
for
the
time
to
place
buy
orders
,
''
he
said
.

``
For
us
institutional
investors
,
the
chance
for
buying
has
come
.

''
Isao
Ushikubo
,
general
manager
of
the
investment
research
department
at
Toyo
Trust
&
Banking
Co.
,
also
was
optimistic
.

He
described
Friday
's
plunge
in
the
U.S.
as
a
``
fleeting
''
event
resulting
in
part
from
excessive
merger
and
acquisition
activity
.

``
Unless
there
is
a
panic
,
this
is
the
best
time
to
buy
,
as
was
the
case
two
years
ago
,
''
he
said
.

``
Those
shares
which
had
posted
gains
on
M&A
speculation
were
dashed
with
cold
water
,
but
as
far
as
major
stocks
are
concerned
,
there
is
n't
much
impact
.

''
Other
fund
managers
were
similarly
sanguine
.

``
We
have
no
plans
to
adjust
our
asset
allocation
in
foreign
equities
,
''
said
Masato
Murakami
,
chief
portfolio
manager
in
the
pension
fund
management
department
at
Yasuda
Trust
&
Banking
Co
.

He
said
Friday
's
Wall
Street
decline
was
``
well
within
the
range
of
volatility
''
that
Yasuda
Trust
plans
for
when
it
charts
its
overseas
investment
strategy
.

Among
other
Asian
and
Pacific
markets
,
Malaysia
and
Singapore
had
the
biggest
losses
,
with
the
Kuala
Lumpur
composite
index
in
Malaysia
falling
11.5
%
and
Singapore
's
Straits
Times
Industrial
Index
down
10
%
.

Major
indexes
declined
more
than
8
%
in
Australia
and
New
Zealand
and
6.5
%
in
Hong
Kong
.

Bangkok
,
Manila
,
Seoul
,
Taipei
and
Jakarta
escaped
with
slightly
smaller
losses
.

Brokers
and
fund
managers
said
the
region
's
markets
were
reacting
to
Friday
's
Wall
Street
plunge
even
though
that
decline
was
due
to
local
factors
such
as
failed
corporate
buy-outs
and
a
deteriorating
junk-bond
market
.

``
It
's
pure
psychology
,
''
said
William
Au
Yeung
,
an
account
executive
for
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
(
HK
)
Ltd.
in
Hong
Kong
.

``
Markets
in
this
region
are
n't
so
geared
to
leveraged
buy-outs
,
and
their
economies
generally
are
in
good
shape
,
but
there
's
no
doubt
that
Asia
is
still
following
America
's
lead
.

''
Several
analysts
said
Malaysia
and
Singapore
had
the
biggest
losses
because
they
are
relatively
open
to
rapid
cash
flows
.

Hong
Kong
is
the
region
's
next
most
open
market
,
but
many
foreign
investors
have
been
staying
away
from
it
since
it
plunged
in
June
amid
political
turmoil
in
China
.

``
Singapore
took
the
hit
because
when
people
want
to
get
out
,
they
tend
to
go
where
the
liquidity
is
,
''
said
Elizabeth
Hambrecht
,
a
regional
analyst
with
Baring
Securities
(
Hong
Kong
)
Ltd
.

She
pointed
out
that
even
after
Monday
's
10
%
decline
,
the
Straits
Times
index
is
up
24
%
this
year
,
so
investors
who
bailed
out
generally
did
so
profitably
.

Similarly
,
Kuala
Lumpur
's
composite
index
yesterday
ended
27.5
%
above
its
1988
close
.

In
Hong
Kong
,
the
Hang
Seng
Index
fell
180.60
to
finish
at
2601.70
.

Trading
was
heavy
at
about
one
billion
shares
,
compared
with
473.9
million
Friday
.

But
the
session
was
orderly
,
in
contrast
to
the
market
's
four-day
closure
after
the
1987
crash
.

Richard
Chenevix-Trench
,
a
director
at
Hong
Kong-based
Baring
International
Fund
Managers
Ltd.
,
said
the
market
probably
has
n't
hit
bottom
yet
but
is
close
.

``
If
New
York
does
n't
collapse
,
I
see
maybe
another
5
%
on
the
downside
,
not
counting
the
risk
of
bad
news
out
of
China
,
''
he
said
.

In
Australia
,
Sydney
's
All
Ordinaries
index
closed
at
1601.5
,
down
8.1
%
,
its
biggest
drop
since
October
1987
.

But
volume
rose
only
to
162
million
shares
from
143
million
Friday
.

Nestor
Hinzack
,
an
analyst
at
brokerage
firm
Burdett
,
Buckeridge
&
Young
Ltd.
,
described
the
market
's
performance
as
``
sheep-like
''
as
investors
fled
to
bluechip
Australian
stocks
and
shunned
entrepreneurial
companies
they
perceived
as
having
any
takeover
premium
built
into
the
price
.

London
's
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
,
the
most
closely
watched
market
barometer
,
ended
at
its
intraday
high
of
2163.4
,
down
70.5
,
or
3.2
%
.

At
its
low
,
shortly
before
Wall
Street
opened
,
it
was
off
more
than
130
points
.

The
Financial
Times
30-share
index
closed
79.3
points
lower
at
1738.7
.

Volume
more
than
doubled
to
959.3
million
shares
from
457.7
million
Friday
.

Prices
on
the
Frankfurt
Stock
Exchange
tumbled
in
heavy
trading
.

The
decline
in
the
German
Stock
Index
of
203.56
points
,
or
12.8
%
,
to
1385.72
was
the
Frankfurt
market
's
steepest
fall
ever
.

Retail
investors
dumped
holdings
on
a
massive
scale
,
pushing
some
blue-chip
shares
down
as
much
as
20
%
.

Analysts
cited
memories
of
two
years
ago
,
when
many
small
investors
held
on
to
their
shares
after
the
October
crash
but
the
West
German
market
continued
to
decline
steeply
for
the
next
three
months
.

Here
are
price
trends
on
the
world
's
major
stock
markets
,
as
calculated
by
Morgan
Stanley
Capital
International
Perspective
,
Geneva
.

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100
.

The
percentage
change
is
since
year-end
.

Last
week
's
best
and
worst
performing
stocks
among
those
issues
that
make
up
80
%
of
the
world
's
stock
market
capitalization
(
in
local
currency
)
Frank
Lloyd
Wright
is
reported
to
have
said
once
that
if
you
tipped
the
world
on
its
side
,
everything
loose
would
end
up
in
California
.

We
've
always
thought
that
Mr.
Wright
underestimated
California
's
vitality
,
but
maybe
the
state
's
la-la
factions
are
starting
to
overwhelm
the
forces
that
made
it
such
a
significant
place
.

What
else
is
one
to
make
of
the
whacky
save-the-earth
initiative
just
proposed
by
several
major
environmental
groups
and
organized
by
the
state
's
attorney
general
?
If
passed
by
the
voters
,
the
recently
announced
initiative
would
phase
out
major
pesticides
,
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
by
40
%
,
ban
new
offshore
drilling
,
ban
chemicals
thought
to
deplete
the
ozone
layer
,
and
create
a
new
state
environmental
officer
armed
with
a
$
40
million
budget
to
sue
any
firm
or
agency
he
thinks
is
being
too
dirty
.

The
initiative
is
based
largely
on
the
wish-lists
of
the
green
lobby
:
the
Sierra
Club
,
the
League
of
Conservation
Voters
,
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
,
the
National
Toxics
Campaign
and
the
Citizens
for
a
Better
Environment
.

Interestingly
,
the
Environmental
Defense
Fund
is
having
nothing
to
do
with
this
one
.

Not
only
Californians
but
all
Americans
would
pay
if
this
thing
passed
.

The
initiative
bars
the
sale
of
any
crops
in
California
that
do
n't
meet
the
initiative
's
standards
.

Kansas
wheat
farmers
and
Florida
fruit
growers
would
have
to
adjust
or
give
up
the
California
market
.

In
other
words
,
California
is
presuming
to
take
control
of
the
nation
's
farm
policy
.

As
usual
the
green
lobby
's
proposal
is
disconnected
from
scientific
reality
.

Consider
the
greenhouse-effect
provision
.

The
proposed
initiative
would
mandate
a
reduction
of
carbon
dioxide
of
40
%
.

Even
if
one
buys
into
the
whole
greenhouse
theory
,
it
is
inconceivable
that
reductions
in
a
single
state
could
have
any
impact
on
what
is
billed
as
a
global
problem
.

But
if
rational
science
and
economics
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
new
environment
initiative
,
what
is
going
on
?
The
first
place
to
look
under
these
circumstances
is
at
the
ways
in
which
the
sponsors
themselves
will
benefit
.

The
key
here
is
the
ambition
of
state
Attorney
General
John
Van
de
Kamp
.

He
's
running
for
governor
.

Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
is
the
one
who
collected
the
plans
from
the
various
radical
environmental
groups
and
cobbled
them
into
a
single
unwieldy
initiative
to
be
placed
on
the
ballot
for
election
on
Nov.
6
,
1990
.

That
's
also
the
day
of
the
gubernatorial
election
.

The
initiative
seems
to
have
been
crafted
to
include
all
the
hot
issues
that
set
off
the
wealthy
Hollywood
weepers
who
donate
money
.

And
it
allows
Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
to
get
around
campaign
spending
limits
.

He
can
spend
the
legal
maximum
for
his
campaign
;
all
the
spending
for
the
Van
de
Kamp
initiative
(
on
which
there
are
no
limits
)
is
gravy
.

This
initiative
is
being
labeled
The
Big
Green
,
but
maybe
it
should
be
called
The
Big
Greenback
.

(
The
Republican
candidate
,
Sen.
Pete
Wilson
,
is
playing
the
initiative
fundraising
game
too
,
sponsoring
his
own
crime
initiative
.

)
While
it
is
possible
that
the
Big
Green
initiative
will
be
ruled
unconstitutional
,
it
is
of
course
conceivable
that
in
modern
California
it
could
slide
through
.

This
is
the
state
that
recently
passed
the
Prop.
65
anti-toxic
initiative
.

If
this
new
proposal
ever
does
become
law
,
the
green
lobby
will
benefit
directly
.

The
initiative
creates
a
free
floating
state
environmental
officer
to
sue
companies
or
government
agencies
that
do
things
he
does
n't
like
.

That
means
the
NRDC
and
such
groups
no
longer
would
have
to
spend
as
much
money
on
litigation
;
taxpayers
would
bear
the
cost
.

Mr.
Van
de
Kamp
and
his
allies
may
be
hoping
that
the
environment
is
such
a
mom
and
apple-pie
issue
among
certain
segments
of
California
's
population
now
that
almost
any
collection
of
anti-scientific
,
anti-pocketbook
nonsense
can
pass
under
its
rubric
.

Of
course
the
state
's
liberals
are
not
yet
a
nation
unto
themselves
.

George
Bush
,
for
example
,
may
decide
that
he
does
n't
want
to
be
the
President
who
lost
control
of
interstate
commerce
to
an
attorney
general
from
California
.

And
some
other
segments
of
California
's
political
and
media
culture
may
yet
start
to
point
out
that
the
initiative
would
impose
significant
costs
on
the
state
's
less
affluent
citizens
in
the
form
of
higher
food
prices
and
lost
jobs
.

This
grandiose
initiative
will
help
California
define
itself
for
the
future
either
as
a
state
still
tethered
to
economic
and
scientific
reality
,
or
as
one
being
led
to
wherever
its
la-la
activists
want
to
take
it
.

First
,
there
was
a
death
watch
.

Then
exhilaration
.

Spurred
by
waves
of
large-scale
buying
in
blue-chip
stocks
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rallied
yesterday
and
erased
about
a
half
of
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
,
gaining
88.12
to
2657.38
.

It
was
the
fourth-biggest
advance
for
the
average
of
30
blue
chips
,
on
frenetic
New
York
Stock
Exchange
volume
of
416,290,000
shares
--
the
highest
since
the
days
after
the
1987
crash
.

While
the
advance
cheered
investors
who
feared
a
1987-style
crash
would
occur
yesterday
,
it
was
strictly
a
big-stock
rally
fed
by
huge
buying
by
bargain-hunting
institutions
and
program
traders
.

A
troubling
sign
:
Declining
stocks
on
the
Big
Board
outnumbered
advancers
,
975
to
749
,
and
the
over-the-counter
market
that
includes
many
smaller
stocks
suffered
aftershocks
of
Friday
's
late
Big
Board
plunge
.

The
Nasdaq
OTC
index
closed
down
6.31
to
460.98
.

Meanwhile
,
in
a
divergence
in
two
of
the
market
's
most
important
indicators
,
the
Dow
industrials
'
sister
average
,
the
20-stock
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
,
tumbled
102.06
to
1304.23
--
its
second-worst
decline
next
to
the
164.78-point
fall
during
the
1987
crash
.

Transports
plunged
on
takeover
disappointments
in
two
airline
stocks
,
UAL
and
AMR
,
which
each
fell
more
than
20
%
when
they
reopened
for
trading
yesterday
after
being
suspended
Friday
afternoon
.

UAL
,
the
takeover
stock
at
the
center
of
Friday
's
190.58-point
market
plunge
,
fell
56
to
222
on
nearly
2.3
million
shares
.

Overall
,
``
this
is
a
pleasant
rally
but
it
's
very
selective
,
''
said
Arthur
Cashin
Jr.
,
a
veteran
PaineWebber
Inc.
trader
at
the
Big
Board
.

``
Everyone
was
a
little
concerned
about
the
general
narrowness
of
the
rally
and
failure
of
the
OTC
market
to
get
into
plus
territory
.

It
's
just
a
strange
feeling
.

I
do
n't
think
anyone
left
the
place
whistling
Dixie
.

''
The
rally
gave
credence
,
at
least
for
now
,
to
the
pre-trading
declaration
of
Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
that
Friday
's
market
debacle
was
``
an
abnormal
condition
,
and
not
a
disaster
.

''
But
to
traders
,
it
looked
like
disaster
on
the
9:30
a.m.
opening
bell
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
opened
down
1.64
shortly
after
9:30
.

But
most
of
the
30
blue-chip
stocks
in
the
average
,
including
Eastman
Kodak
and
General
Motors
,
could
n't
trade
because
of
the
heavy
backlog
of
sell
orders
left
over
from
Friday
's
late-afternoon
rout
.

At
9:45
,
Procter
&
Gamble
--
one
of
the
most
important
Dow
bellwethers
of
late
--
opened
down
2
to
117
.

The
Dow
dropped
to
a
quick
27-point
loss
,
and
to
many
traders
it
looked
as
if
stocks
were
headed
for
yet
another
big
tumble
.

More
stocks
opened
over
the
ensuing
half
hour
,
as
the
49
Big
Board
specialist
firms
in
charge
of
keeping
the
market
orderly
groped
to
find
buy
orders
from
major
brokerage
firms
to
match
the
selling
flood
.

Then
,
to
make
matters
worse
,
computerized
sell
programs
kicked
in
,
hammering
stocks
into
steeper
losses
.

There
was
heavy
stock-index
arbitrage
,
as
traders
sold
big
baskets
of
stock
and
bought
stock-index
futures
to
profit
from
the
price
discrepancies
between
the
two
markets
.

This
was
a
hangover
from
Friday
,
when
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
had
closed
at
a
sharp
discount
to
stocks
.

The
onslaught
of
the
program
selling
dashed
any
hopes
that
some
of
the
big
program
trading
firms
would
hold
off
until
the
market
stabilized
.

They
did
n't
.

The
Dow
accelerated
its
slide
,
losing
63.52
in
the
first
40
minutes
of
trading
.

With
program
traders
seemingly
in
charge
,
buyers
backed
away
from
the
market
and
watched
stocks
fall
.

Then
at
10:15
the
Dow
suddenly
started
to
rebound
,
and
when
it
shot
upward
it
did
so
even
faster
than
the
early-morning
fall
.

And
this
time
,
it
was
n't
just
the
program
traders
who
were
responsible
.

All
the
selling
had
pushed
stocks
to
such
cheap
values
that
big
investment
banks
and
major
money
management
firms
started
buying
stocks
heavily
.

The
program
traders
were
in
there
,
too
,
of
course
.

But
according
to
one
trader
,
the
programmers
``
did
n't
look
as
dominant
on
the
upside
as
on
the
downside
because
there
was
{
also
}
a
lot
of
bargain-hunting
''
by
institutions
.

Roland
M.
Machold
,
director
of
the
New
Jersey
Division
of
Investment
,
which
oversees
$
29
billion
in
investments
,
said
the
``
first
thing
we
did
was
to
double
our
orders
''
yesterday
morning
.

``
With
the
market
down
like
this
,
we
'll
probably
take
another
$
50
million
and
put
it
in
''
the
market
.

Trading
in
Walt
Disney
Co.
particularly
caught
traders
'
eyes
.

According
to
Big
Board
officials
,
Disney
had
one
of
the
biggest
sell-order
imbalances
on
Friday
;
it
was
one
of
the
seven
stocks
that
could
n't
finish
trading
that
day
.

The
stock
opened
late
at
114
,
down
8
.

But
then
it
shot
upward
7
as
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
stepped
in
and
bought
,
traders
said
.

However
,
Disney
specialist
Robert
Fagenson
said
:
``
I
would
be
surprised
if
Goldman
represented
4
%
of
the
opening
volume
.

''
Around
Wall
Street
,
trading
desks
were
relieved
that
they
could
at
least
play
the
market
yesterday
,
in
contrast
to
Friday
's
gridlock
.

At
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Inc.
,
head
equity
trader
Dudley
Eppel
said
:
``
I
think
the
opening
was
constructive
.

It
was
orderly
.

We
put
some
orders
together
.

There
was
n't
a
lot
of
panic
selling
,
either
domestically
or
internationally
...
.

Not
like
Friday
where
they
just
took
{
the
market
}
apart
.

''
Still
,
the
market
had
n't
yet
crossed
into
positive
territory
,
and
traders
were
glum
.

But
in
another
dramatic
burst
,
the
Dow
tacked
on
42
points
in
five
minutes
,
and
at
10:25
the
index
showed
a
gain
of
5.74
.

On
the
Big
Board
floor
and
on
trading
desks
,
traders
yelped
their
approval
.

Grinned
Griffith
Peck
,
a
trader
in
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
's
OTC
department
:
``
I
tell
you
,
this
market
acts
healthy
.

''
Around
him
,
scores
of
traders
seemed
to
get
a
burst
of
energy
;
their
boss
broke
out
bottles
of
Perrier
water
to
cool
them
off
.

Among
Big
Board
specialists
,
the
cry
was
``
Pull
your
offers
''
--
meaning
that
specialists
soon
expected
to
get
higher
prices
for
their
shares
.

``
It
was
bedlam
on
the
upside
,
''
said
one
Big
Board
specialist
.

But
not
everybody
was
making
money
.

The
carnage
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
the
nation
's
major
options
market
,
was
heavy
after
the
trading
in
S&P
100
stock-index
options
was
halted
Friday
.

Many
market
makers
in
the
S&P
100
index
options
contract
had
bullish
positions
Friday
,
and
when
the
shutdown
came
they
were
frozen
with
huge
losses
.

Over
the
weekend
,
clearing
firms
told
the
Chicago
market
makers
to
get
out
of
their
positions
at
any
cost
Monday
morning
.

``
They
were
absolutely
killed
,
slaughtered
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
options
trader
.

Some
traders
said
that
the
closely
watched
Major
Market
Index
,
whose
20
stocks
mimic
the
Dow
industrials
,
did
n't
lead
yesterday
's
big
rally
.

James
Gallagher
,
a
partner
at
specialist
Fowler
&
Rosenau
,
said
,
``
The
difference
between
today
and
two
years
ago
''
--
``
Terrible
Tuesday
,
''
Oct.
20
,
1987
--
``
is
that
then
we
needed
a
savior
to
go
into
the
Major
Market
Index
,
spend
$
2
million
and
get
the
program
rally
started
.

This
time
{
institutions
}
saw
the
programs
coming
and
backed
away
and
backed
away
.

Then
when
the
market
was
at
a
technical
level
to
buy
,
they
came
in
with
a
vengeance
.

''
However
,
according
to
one
analyst
,
the
timing
of
Major
Market
Index
futures
buying
just
before
the
turnaround
was
similar
to
that
of
Terrible
Tuesday
.

``
Futures
were
pulling
the
stock
market
higher
,
''
said
Donald
Selkin
,
head
of
stock-index
futures
research
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

Although
the
Big
Board
's
specialist
firms
struggled
through
another
highly
volatile
trading
session
,
their
performance
yesterday
was
better
than
during
Friday
's
late-afternoon
chaos
,
according
to
traders
and
brokers
who
work
with
them
.

Specialists
were
criticized
for
their
inability
to
maintain
orderly
markets
during
the
Friday
plunge
.

But
yesterday
,
even
with
halts
in
such
major
blue-chip
stocks
as
Merck
,
``
we
expected
(
the
halts
)
and
it
was
n't
too
bad
,
''
said
Donaldson
's
Mr.
Eppel
,
who
had
been
critical
of
the
specialists
'
performance
on
Friday
.

According
to
a
Big
Board
official
,
while
many
stocks
opened
late
,
there
were
subsequent
trading
halts
in
only
three
issues
--
AMR
,
Merck
and
Valero
Energy
.

Merck
is
one
of
the
most
important
stocks
in
the
Major
Market
Index
.

No
sector
of
the
market
has
been
spared
during
the
past
two
days
'
gyrations
.

Yet
from
the
Dow
industrials
'
high
on
Oct.
9
through
Friday
's
plunge
,
relatively
good
performances
have
been
turned
in
by
real-estate
,
utilities
,
precious
metals
and
life
insurance
stocks
.

And
yesterday
,
the
top
performing
industry
group
was
oil
field
equipment
issues
.

For
example
,
Halliburton
jumped
3
to
38
,
Schlumberger
rose
2
to
43
and
Baker
Hughes
rose
1
to
22
.

Because
of
the
UAL
and
AMR
tumbles
,
airlines
were
the
weakest
sector
of
the
market
yesterday
.

Philip
Morris
was
the
Big
Board
's
most
active
issue
,
rising
2
to
43
on
nearly
eight
million
shares
.

Among
other
major
issues
,
Coca-Cola
Co.
closed
up
2
at
66
on
1.7
million
shares
and
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
rose
3
to
43
on
nearly
7.8
million
shares
.

Shares
of
International
Business
Machines
,
which
reported
earnings
yesterday
,
finished
at
103
,
up
1
,
after
slipping
below
100
during
Friday
's
session
for
the
first
time
in
five
years
.

Shares
of
three
brokerage
firms
rose
after
they
reported
earnings
.

Merrill
Lynch
added
1
to
28
,
PaineWebber
rose
to
18
and
Bear
Stearns
rose
to
14
.

Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
,
a
recently
hot
stock
,
climbed
4
to
124
on
nearly
1.6
million
shares
.

At
a
news
conference
after
the
close
of
trading
yesterday
,
the
Big
Board
's
Mr.
Phelan
and
other
exchange
officials
praised
the
performance
of
their
computers
and
personnel
.

Mr.
Phelan
said
that
program
trading
strategies
were
n't
responsible
for
triggering
Friday
's
decline
despite
a
jump
in
the
use
of
the
computer-driven
strategies
in
recent
months
.

Some
24
million
of
the
more
than
100
million
shares
traded
in
the
final
90
minutes
of
Friday
's
session
,
when
the
plunge
in
stock
prices
was
concentrated
,
were
program-related
,
he
said
.

Program
trades
make
up
10
%
of
the
exchange
's
volume
on
an
average
day
,
but
despite
the
increase
Friday
,
it
was
``
certainly
not
something
you
would
say
precipitated
the
market
decline
,
''
Mr.
Phelan
said
.

Mr.
Phelan
expressed
relief
that
the
market
rebounded
yesterday
.

``
Obviously
,
every
time
we
get
this
kind
of
reaction
,
it
's
going
to
make
everybody
nervous
,
including
me
,
''
he
said
.

He
said
that
exchange
officials
had
conversations
with
Wall
Street
firms
throughout
the
weekend
and
that
``
all
the
participants
behaved
very
,
very
responsibly
today
.

''
Meanwhile
,
Peter
DaPuzzo
,
Shearson
's
head
of
retail
equity
trading
,
praised
institutional
investors
in
the
OTC
market
,
who
were
heavy
buyers
of
the
Nasdaq
's
biggest
technology
issues
yesterday
amid
a
flood
of
selling
by
other
investors
.

``
The
institutions
ca
n't
be
criticized
for
their
behavior
,
''
Mr.
DaPuzzo
said
in
an
interview
.

``
It
was
the
opposite
of
what
happened
on
Oct.
19
.

They
used
their
judgment
.

They
did
n't
panic
during
the
first
round
of
selling
this
morning
.

Instead
,
they
bought
on
weakness
and
sold
into
the
strength
,
which
kept
the
market
orderly
.

Maybe
they
learned
from
experience
.

''
Mr.
Phelan
said
the
performance
of
specialists
during
Friday
's
plunge
was
admirable
,
because
out
of
1,640
Big
Board
common
stocks
traded
during
the
day
only
seven
were
closed
and
were
n't
reopened
before
the
close
.

``
They
did
an
excellent
job
,
''
Mr.
Phelan
said
of
the
specialists
.

Wall
Street
traders
on
Friday
had
complained
about
the
trading
suspensions

for
them
to

the
World
Court
to
``
order
''
a
permanent
cancellation
of
the
$
1.5
billion
flight
.

A
three-judge
appeals
panel
yesterday
refused
to
comply
,
though
liberal
Judge
Pat
Wald
went
out
of
her
way
to
deny
that
this
was
a
``
frivolous
''
case
.

Of
course
it
was
.

NASA
should
now
sue
for
fines
against
all
three
politico-plaintiffs
,
foreign
and
domestic
,
for
bringing
this
mischievous
case
.

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
a
permanent
smoking
ban
on
all
domestic
airline
routes
within
the
continental
U.S.
and
on
all
flights
of
six
hours
or
less
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
.

The
restrictions
would
cover
all
but
a
small
percentage
of
domestic
air
traffic
,
and
represent
a
major
expansion
of
the
current
smoking
ban
on
flights
of
two
hours
or
less
.

The
exemption
allowed
on
longer
flights
to
Alaska
and
Hawaii
appears
to
be
largely
a
face-saving
concession
for
the
traditionally
powerful
tobacco
industry
,
which
has
found
itself
increasingly
isolated
in
the
face
of
public
pressure
in
recent
years
.

By
a
6-4
margin
,
House
negotiators
initially
rejected
last
night
a
Senate
provision
covering
all
domestic
flights
.

But
the
six-hour
compromise
was
soon
agreed
to
in
subsequent
discussions
.

As
a
practical
matter
,
flights
from
the
West
Coast
to
Hawaii
would
be
covered
as
they
are
under
the
time
limit
,
but
the
language
would
exempt
longer
routes
beginning
,
for
example
,
in
Chicago
or
on
the
East
Coast
.

Within
the
Senate
,
the
ban
has
had
aggressive
support
from
Sen.
Frank
Lautenberg
(
D.
,
N.J.
)
,
who
has
used
his
position
as
a
Senate
Appropriations
subcommittee
chairman
to
garner
votes
for
the
initiative
.

The
measure
is
attached
to
the
more
than
$
26
billion
fiscal
1990
transportation
bill
within
Mr.
Lautenberg
's
jurisdiction
,
and
the
final
compromise
is
laced
with
more
than
$
205
million
in
road
projects
earmarked
by
members
as
well
as
funds
sought
by
major
airports
,
including
Denver
.

From
the
outset
,
the
tobacco
industry
has
been
uncertain
as
to
what
strategy
to
follow
.

But
the
industry
retains
support
in
the
House
leadership
through
the
influence
of
grower
states
,
such
as
North
Carolina
.

Majority
Whip
William
Gray
owes
a
political
debt
to
Southern
agriculture
lawmakers
for
his
rise
in
the
House
,
and
the
Philadelphia
Democrat
used
his
position
in
the
conference
to
salvage
the
exemption
from
a
total
ban
.

Although
the
smoking
provision
has
attracted
the
most
public
interest
,
the
underlying
bill
was
the
subject
of
behind-the-scenes
lobbying
because
of
its
impact
on
air
transportation
and
the
more
mundane
,
but
politically
important
,
projects
of
members
.

In
a
stark
lesson
in
the
power
of
the
appropriations
committees
,
the
House
deliberately
killed
a
handful
of
projects
backed
by
lawmakers
in
Florida
,
Illinois
and
Pennsylvania
who
had
voted
against
the
panel
leadership
on
the
House
floor
.

``
Anybody
can
vote
as
they
want
,
''
said
Rep.
William
Lehman
(
D.
,
Fla.
)
,
head
of
the
House
conferees
.

``
But
if
you
make
a
request
,
you
should
support
the
committee
.

''
Within
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
,
the
final
bill
promises
to
increase
spending
for
facilities
and
equipment
by
more
than
20
%
from
last
year
,
and
total
operations
would
rise
to
$
3.84
billion
--
a
12
%
boost
.

The
facilities
account
includes
$
40
million
for
Denver
's
ambitious
new
airport
,
and
the
competition
for
these
funds
created
shifting
alliances
between
urban
lawmakers
representing
established
airports
in
Philadelphia
and
Michigan
and
the
major
carriers
to
Denver
,
United
and
Continental
.

Leery
of
the
costs
--
and
,
critics
say
,
competition
--
the
airlines
have
sought
to
gain
leverage
over
the
city
of
Denver
.

Texas
Air
Corp.
,
which
owns
Continental
,
and
the
Air
Transport
Association
were
prominent
in
the
lobbying
.

The
industry
sought
to
impose
conditions
that
would
have
delayed
funds
for
the
project
until
Denver
and
the
airlines
had
agreed
to
leases
for
50
%
of
the
gates
.

But
this
was
rejected
in
favor
of
much
looser
language
directing
the
Transportation
Department
to
review
the
costs
of
the
first
phase
,
expected
to
cost
about
$
2
billion
.

Though
smaller
in
total
dollars
,
the
conference
agreed
to
preserve
an
estimated
$
30.6
million
in
controversial
subsidies
to
carriers
serving
rural
or
isolated
airports
.

The
sum
is
more
than
double
what
the
House
had
approved
for
the
program
,
but
the
list
of
qualified
airports
would
be
cut
by
22
under
new
distance
requirements
and
limits
on
the
level
of
subsidy
.

Congress
previously
cut
six
airports
this
year
.

The
impact
of
the
changes
is
to
eliminate
many
of
the
most
excessive
cases
where
the
government
has
been
paying
more
than
$
200
for
each
passenger
in
subsidies
.

Among
rail
and
highway
accounts
,
the
agreement
provides
$
615
million
for
Amtrak
,
including
$
85
million
for
capital
improvements
.

And
federal-formula
grants
for
mass
transit
would
be
effectively
frozen
at
$
1.625
billion
,
or
$
20
million
more
than
last
fiscal
year
.

and
Guber-Peters
have
countersued

charging

Congress
has
been
critical
of
the
Bush
administration
for
not
sending
enough
aid
to
Poland
,
so
it
is
getting
ready
to
send
its
own
version
of
a
CARE
package
.

Last
month
,
the
Senate
voted
to
send
a
delegation
of
congressional
staffers
to
Poland
to
assist
its
legislature
,
the
Sejm
,
in
democratic
procedures
.

Senator
Pete
Domenici
calls
this
effort
``
the
first
gift
of
democracy
.

''
The
Poles
might
do
better
to
view
it
as
a
Trojan
Horse
.

It
is
the
vast
shadow
government
of
15,000
congressional
staffers
that
helps
create
such
legislative
atrocities
as
the
1,376
page
,
13-pound
reconciliation
bill
that
claimed
to
be
the
budget
of
the
United
States
.

Maybe
after
the
staffers
explain
their
work
to
the
Poles
,
they
'd
be
willing
to
come
back
and
do
the
same
for
the
American
people
.

Waterford
Wedgwood
PLC
,
a
financially
troubled
Irish
maker
of
fine
crystal
and
Wedgwood
china
,
reported
that
its
pretax
loss
for
the
first
six
months
widened
to
10.6
million
Irish
punts
(
$
14.9
million
)
from
5.8
million
Irish
punts
a
year
earlier
.

The
results
for
the
half
were
worse
than
market
expectations
,
which
suggested
an
interim
loss
of
around
10
million
Irish
punts
.

In
a
sharply
weaker
London
market
yesterday
,
Waterford
shares
were
down
15
pence
at
50
pence
(
79
cents
)
.

The
company
reported
a
loss
after
taxation
and
minority
interests
of
14
million
Irish
punts
,
compared
with
a
loss
of
9.3
million
Irish
punts
for
the
year-earlier
period
.

There
were
n't
any
extraordinary
items
.

Sales
for
the
total
group
rose
27
%
to
168.1
million
Irish
punts
compared
with
132.6
million
Irish
punts
a
year
ago
.

Waterford
has
decided
against
paying
an
interim
dividend
.

Waterford
said
the
appointment
of
a
new
management
team
and
the
signing
of
a
comprehensive
labor
agreement
are
expected
to
enhance
the
company
's
long-term
prospects
.

The
sudden
``
flight
to
quality
''
that
triggered
Friday
's
explosive
bond-market
rally
was
reversed
yesterday
in
a
``
flight
from
quality
''
rout
.

The
setback
,
in
which
Treasury
bond
prices
plummeted
,
reflected
a
rebound
in
the
stock
market
and
profit-taking
.

``
It
was
a
pretty
wild
day
.

Our
markets
were
closely
tied
to
the
stock
market
,
''
said
Joel
Kazis
,
manager
of
trading
at
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.

``
Friday
's
flight
to
quality
was
no
longer
needed
once
the
stock
market
found
its
legs
,
''
he
said
.

Some
fixed-income
investors
had
expected
a
further
drop
in
stock
prices
after
the
nearly
200-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
on
Friday
.

That
caused
investors
to
flee
stocks
and
buy
high-quality
Treasury
bonds
,
which
are
safer
than
other
types
of
securities
.

But
when
stocks
began
to
climb
instead
,
prices
of
Treasury
bonds
declined
.

Contributing
to
the
selling
pressure
were
dispatches
by
several
investment
firms
advising
clients
to
boost
their
stock
holdings
and
reduce
the
size
of
their
cash
or
bond
portfolios
.

Among
the
firms
were
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
and
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc
.

The
bond
market
seemed
to
ignore
evidence
that
the
Federal
Reserve
eased
credit
conditions
slightly
by
allowing
the
federal
funds
rate
to
drift
as
low
as
8
%
.

The
closely
watched
rate
on
federal
funds
,
or
overnight
loans
between
banks
,
slid
to
about
8
%
last
week
,
down
from
its
perceived
target
level
of
about
9
%
.

The
rate
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in
Fed
policy
.

Traders
said
yesterday
's
modest
easing
did
n't
stir
much
enthusiasm
because
it
had
been
widely
expected
.

In
fact
,
some
economists
contend
that
the
latest
easing
started
last
week
.

Others
note
that
some
investors
were
disappointed
because
they
had
expected
a
more
aggressive
easing
.

The
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
ended
about
1
points
lower
,
or
down
about
$
17.50
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

The
reversal
was
even
more
evident
among
shorter-term
Treasury
securities
.

After
Treasury
bill
rates
plummeted
as
much
as
0.70
percentage
point
on
Friday
,
they
gave
back
three-fourths
of
that
amount
yesterday
.

The
bond-equivalent
yield
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
,
for
example
,
was
quoted
late
yesterday
at
7.72
%
,
compared
with
7.16
%
Friday
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
,
mortgage-backed
securities
and
municipal
bonds
also
fell
.

But
prices
of
junk
bonds
,
which
were
battered
Friday
in
near
standstill
trading
,
rebounded
to
post
small
gains
after
a
volatile
trading
session
.

Junk
bonds
opened
as
much
as
four
points
lower
but
staged
a
modest
comeback
as
stock
prices
firmed
.

Some
traders
said
the
high-yield
market
was
helped
by
active
institutional
buying
.

In
particular
,
they
said
,
firms
such
as
First
Boston
Corp.
and
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
began
making
a
market
in
junk
issues
early
in
the
session
when
prices
hit
severely
depressed
levels
.

``
I
think
the
willingness
of
securities
companies
to
make
markets
for
high-yield
issues
improved
the
sentiment
for
junk
bonds
,
''
said
John
Lonski
,
an
economist
at
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc
.

U.S.
Treasury
bonds
were
higher
in
overnight
trading
in
Japan
,
which
opened
at
about
7:30
p.m.
EDT
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
,
for
example
rose
one
point
in
early
Japanese
trading
in
reaction
to
a
quick
600-point
drop
in
the
Tokyo
stock
market
.

But
as
Japanese
stocks
rebounded
,
Treasurys
retreated
and
ended
just
modestly
higher
.

Many
U.S.
trading
operations
,
wanting
to
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
Japanese
trading
as
an
indication
of
where
U.S.
trading
would
begin
,
were
fully
staffed
during
the
Tokyo
trading
session
.

``
Most
of
the
action
was
during
the
night
session

''
said
Michael
Moore
,
trading
manager
at
Continental
Bank
.

Jay
Goldinger
,
who
often
trades
overnight
for
Capital
Insight
Inc.
,
Beverly

was
``
very
active

``
We

Tokyo
's

turned
out
to
be
a
bad
bellwether
for
U.S.
trading
.

When
the
market
opened
here
,
bonds
prices
fell
as
the
stock
market
regained
strength
.

The
bond
market
's
focus
on
stock
activity
was
so
strong
yesterday
that
it
overshadowed
today
's
slate
of
economic
data
,
which
includes
the
government
's
report
on
August
U.S.
merchandise
trade
and
September
industrial
production
.

Industrial
production
is
expected
to
have
declined
0.2
%
,
according
to
a
consensus
of
economists
surveyed
by
Dow
Jones
Capital
Markets
Report
.

The
August
trade
deficit
is
expected
to
have
widened
to
$
9.1
billion
from
$
7.58
billion
in
July
.

A
widening
of
that
magnitude
,
said
one
New
York
trader
,
is
``
not
a
favorable
number
...
.

It
could
do
damage
to
us

Meanwhile
,
agency
supply
is
expected
to
weigh
heavily
on

today
when
the
Federal

Bank
prices
a

2.3
billion
offering
of
one-year
,
three-year
,
five-year
and
10-year
maturities
.

Tomorrow
,
the
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
will
provide
details
of
its
first
bond
issue
,
which
is
expected
to
total
between
$
4
billion
and
$
6
billion
and
carry
a
maturity
greater
than
20
years

Resolution

Treasury
Securities
Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
tumbled
in
moderate
to
active
trading
.

The
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
was
quoted
late
at
a
price
of
101
,
compared
with
a
closing
price
of
103
Friday
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
issue
rose
to
7.97

The

Short-term
interest
rates
fell
yesterday
at
the
government
's
weekly
Treasury
bill
auction
.

The
average
discount
rate
on

the

since
the
average
of
7.36

The

since
the
average
of
7.35
%
at
the
auction
on

31

1989
.

Here
are
auction
details
:
Rates
are
determined
by
the
difference
between

purchase
price

face
value
.

Thus
,
higher
bidding
narrows
the
investor
's
return
while
lower
bidding
widens
it
.

The
percentage
rates
are
calculated
on

Mortgage

gave
up
most
of

ended
to

Dealers
said
morning
activity
was
hectic
as
prices
dropped
in
response
to
gains
in
the
stock
market
and
losses
in

securities
,

trading
slowed
to
moderate

as
the

above
the

Traders
said
there
were
some
busy
dealings
in
Freddie
Mac
and
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
securities
because
underwriters
from
last
week
's
heavy
slate
of
real

mortgage
investment
conduit
issues
moved
to
gather
collateral
for

deals

Offsetting
the
Remic-related
purchases
were
continued
heavy
sales
by
mortgage
originators
,
which
are
producing
increased
amounts
of

There
was
no
new-issue
activity

Municipals
Rebounding
stocks
and
weaker
Treasury
prices
drove
municipal
bonds
to
point
lower
in
late
dealings

The
session
losses
left
municipal
dollar
bonds
close
to
where
they
were
before
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial

Friday
prompted
a
capital

rally

Trading
was
hectic
during
the
morning
,
with
players
trying
to
gauge
whether
equities
would
continue
Friday
's
free
fall
or
stabilize
after
a
brief
spot
of
weakness
.

Tax-exempts
started
the
session
flat
to
a
touch
higher
on
anticipation
of
further
stock

erosion
,
but
bond

rapidly
turned
south
as
it
became
more
clear
that
a
repeat
of
the
October
1987
crash
was
n't
at
hand
.

Professionals
dominated
municipal
trading
throughout
the
session
.

Traders
said
retail
investors
seemed
to
be
hugging
the
sidelines
until
a
measure
of
volatility
is
wrung
out
of
the

Laidlaw
would

increase
its

because
of

credited
its

loss
of

2.4
million
for
the
fiscal
third
quarter

U.S.

again
extended
the
expiration
date
of
its

7-a-share
tender
offer
for

it

to
sell

it

it
needs
the
extension

reach
a
definitive
agreement
on
the
sale
.

U.S.
Banknote
said
it
believes
the
sale
,
if
completed

apparently
would
satisfy
antitrust
issues
raised
by
the
U.S.
Justice
Department
about

``
there
can
be
no
assurance

a
sale
agreement
would
be
concluded
.

It
also
said
the
tender
offer
would
probably
have
to
be
extended
further

complete

arrangements

Gitano
Group
Inc.
said
it
agreed
to
buy
50
%

Sport
Ltd.
,
a
closely
held
apparel
maker

with
the
assumption
of

That
50

now
held

,
Regatta
's
president

chief
executive
officer
,
who
will
continue
to
manage
Regatta
's
operations
under
Gitano
.

In
1989
,
Regatta
will
have
sales
``
in
excess
of

10
million

will
show
a
profit

makes
budget-priced
apparel
sold
mainly
through
mass
merchandisers

said
the
Regatta
acquisition
will
enhance
its
strategy
to
expand
into

said
the
sale
of
preference
units
of
its
newly
formed
Enron
NGL
Partners
L.P.
master
limited
partnership
subsidiary
will
result
in
an
undetermined
gain
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

In
the
year-ago
quarter
,
the
natural
gas
concern
had
net
income
of
$
25.2
million
,
or
34
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
about
$
1.46
billion
.

Those
results
included
a
$
2.7
million
charge
related
to
the
retirement
of
debt
.

In
a
related
move
,
Enron
said
it
increased
the
number
of
the
partnership
's
units
it
will
offer
to
6,930,000
from
5,500,000
.

The
old
and
revised
numbers
both
include
over-allotment
provisions
.

Enron
said
each
unit
will
be
priced
in
the
$
19-to-$21
range
and
will
represent
about
80
%
of
the
partnership
equity
.

Net
proceeds
from
the

are
expected
to
be
close
to
$
200

What
does
n't
belong
here
?
A.
manual
typewriters
,
B.
black-and-white
snapshots
,
C.
radio
adventure
shows
.

If
you
guessed
black-and-white
snapshots
,
you
're
right
.

After
years
of
fading
into
the
background
,
two-tone
photography
is
coming
back
.

Trendy
magazine
advertisements
feature
stark
black-and-white
photos
of
Hollywood
celebrities
pitching
jeans
,
shoes
and
liquor
.

Portrait
studios
accustomed
to
shooting
only
in
color
report
a
rush
to
black-and-white
portrait
orders
.

And
black-and-white
photography
classes
are
crowded
with
students
.

What
's
happening
in
photography
mirrors
the
popularity
of
black
and
white
in
fashion
,
home
furnishings
and
cinematography
.

On
Seventh
Avenue
,
designers
have
been
advancing
the
monochrome
look
with
clothing
collections
done
entirely
in
black
and
white
.

And
classic
black-and-white
movies
are
enjoying
a
comeback
on
videocassette
tapes
,
spurred
,
in
part
,
by
the
backlash
against
colorization
of
old
films
.

``
The
pendulum
is
swinging
back
to
black
and
white
,
''
says
Richard
DeMoulin
,
the
general
manager
of
Eastman
Kodak
Co.
's
professional
photography
division
.

Until
two
years
ago
,
sales
of
black-and-white
film
had
been
declining
steadily
since
the
1960s
.

But
last
year
,
buoyed
by
increased
use
in
advertising
and
other
commercial
applications
,
sales
increased
5
%
,
and
they
are
expected
to
jump
at
least
that
much
again
this
year
.

Photographic
companies
are
scrambling
to
tap
the
resurging
market
,
reviving
some
black-and-white
product
lines
and
developing
new
ones
.

At
Kodak
,
which
largely
ignored
the
market
for
years
,
black-and-white
film
sales
now
account
for
nearly
15
%
of
the
company
's
$
3
billion
in
film
and
paper
sales
annually
,
up
from
10
%
three
years
ago
.

The
Rochester
,
N.Y.
,
photographic
giant
recently
began
marketing
T-Max
3200
,
one
of
the
fastest
and
most
sensitive
monochrome
films
.

Aimed
at
commercial
photographers
,
the
film
can
be
used
in
very
low
light
without
sacrificing
quality
,
says
Donald
Franz
of
Photofinishing
Newsletter
.

Also
trying
to
snare
a
portion
of
the
$
2
billion-a-year
industry
is
Agfa
Corp.
,
a
unit
of
Bayer
AG
.

Agfa
recently
signed
Olympic
gold
medalist
Florence
Griffith-Joyner
to
endorse
a
new
line
of
black-and-white
paper
that
's
geared
to
consumers
and
will
compete
directly
with
Kodak
's
papers
.

Slated
for
market
by
the
end
of
the
year
,
the
paper
``
could
have
been
introduced
a
long
time
ago
but
the
market
was
n't
there
then
,
''
says
an
Agfa
spokesman
.

The
biggest
beneficiary
of
the
black-and-white
revival
is
likely
to
be
International
Paper
Co.
's
Ilford
division
,
known
in
the
industry
for
its
premium
products
.

Sales
of
Ilford
's
four
varieties
of
black-and-white
film
this
year
are
outpacing
growth
in
the
overall
market
,
although
the
company
wo
n't
say
by
exactly
how
much
.

``
We
hope
the
trend
lasts
,
''
says
Laurie
DiCara
,
Ilford
's
marketing
communications
director
.

Why
all
the
interest
?
For
baby
boomers
who
grew
up
being
photographed
in
color
,
black
and
white
seems
eye-catching
and
exotic
.

``
It
has
an
archival
,
almost
nostalgic
quality
to
it
,
''
says
Owen
B.
Butler
,
the
chairman
of
the
applied
photography
department
at
Rochester
Institute
of
Technology
.

``
You
can
shift
out
of
reality
with
black
and
white
,
''
he
adds
.

Such
features
have
been
especially
attractive
to
professional
photographers
and
marketing
executives
,
who
have
been
steadily
increasing
their
use
of
black
and
white
in
advertising
.

Processing
of
black-and-white
commercial
film
jumped
24
%
last
year
to
18.7
million
rolls
.

Consider
Gap
Inc.
,
whose
latest
ad
campaign
features
black-and-white
shots
of
Hollywood
stars
,
artists
and
other
well-known
personalities
modeling
the
retailer
's
jeans
and
T-shirts
.

Richard
Crisman
,
the
account
manager
for
the
campaign
,
says
Gap
did
n't
intentionally
choose
black
and
white
to
distinguish
its
ads
from
the
color
spreads
of
competitors
.

``
We
wanted
to
highlight
the
individual
,
not
the
environment
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
black
and
white
allows
you
to
do
that
better
than
color
.

''
The
campaign
won
a
Cleo
award
as
this
year
's
best
ad
by
a
specialty
retailer
.

Even
food
products
and
automobiles
,
which
have
long
depended
on
color
,
are
making
the
switch
.

Companies
``
feel
black
and
white
will
convey
a
stronger
statement
,
''
says
Marc
L.
Hauser
,
a
Chicago
photographer
who
is
working
on
a
black-and-white
print
ad
for
Stouffer
Food
Corp.
's
Lean
Cuisine
.

Other
companies
that
are
currently
using
two-tone
ads
include
American
Express
Co.
and
Epson
America
Inc
.

Portrait
studios
have
also
latched
onto
the
trend
.

Using
black
and
white
,
``
we
can
make
housewives
look
like
stars
,
''
says
John
Perrin
.

His
On-Broadway
Photography
studio
in
Portland
,
Ore.
,
doubled
its
business
last
year
and
,
he
says
,
is
booked
solid
for
the
next
five
.

One
customer
,
Dayna
Brunsdon
,
says
she
spurned
a
color
portrait
for
black
and
white
because
``
it
's
more
dramatic
.

I
show
it
to
my
friends
,
and
they
all
say
`
wow
.

'
It
is
n't
ordinary
like
color
.

''
Still
,
most
consumers
are
n't
plunking
black-and-white
film
into
their
cameras
to
take
family
snapshots
.

One
big
obstacle
is
that
few
drugstores
develop
the
film
anymore
.

Typically
,
it
must
be
mailed
to
a
handful
of
processors
and
may
take
a
week
or
more
to
be
processed
and
returned
.

Black-and-white
film
costs
consumers
a
little
less
than
color
film
,
and
processing
costs
the
same
.

But
for
photofinishers
,
developing
costs
for
black-and-white
film
are
higher
.

Some
companies
are
starting
to
tackle
that
problem
.

Ilford
,
for
example
,
recently
introduced
a
black-and-white
film
that
can
be
processed
quickly
by
color
labs
.

Intent
on
wooing
customers
,
the
company
is
also
increasing
its
sponsorship
of
black-and-white
photography
classes
.

Similarly
,
Agfa
is
sponsoring
scores
of
photography
contests
at
high
schools
and
colleges
,
offering
free
black-and-white
film
and
paper
as
prizes
.

And
Kodak
is
distributing
an
instructional
video
to
processors
on
how
to
develop
its
monochrome
film
more
efficiently
.

Other
companies
are
introducing
related
products
.

Charles
Beseler
Co.
,
a
leading
maker
of
photographic
enlargers
,
introduced
last
month
a
complete
darkroom
starter
kit
targeted
at
teen-agers
who
want
to
process
their
own
black-and-white
photographs
.

The
kit
,
which
has
a
suggested
retail
price
of
$
250
and
has
already
become
a
bestseller
,
was
introduced
after
retailers
noticed
numerous
requests
from
parents
for
children
's
photography
equipment
.

``
It
seems
computers
as
hobbies
have
waned
,
''
says
Ian
Brightman
,
Beseler
's
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

But
some
industry
observers
believe
the
resurgence
of
black
and
white
is
only
a
fad
.

They
cite
the
emergence
of
still
electronic
photography
,
more
newspapers
turning
to
color
on
their
pages
and
measurable
improvements
in
the
quality
of
color
prints
.

``
Black
and
white
has
n't
made
the
same
quantum
leaps
in
technological
development
as
color
,
''
says
Mr.
Butler
of
the
Rochester
Institute
.

``
The
color
print
today
is
far
superior
to
prints
of
10
years
ago
.

You
ca
n't
say
the
same
with
black
and
white
.

''
But
when
Popular
Photography
,
a
leading
magazine
for
photographers
,
selected
15
of
the
greatest
photos
ever
made
for
its
latest
issue
celebrating
photography
's
150th
anniversary
,
all
were
black
and
white
.

``
It
's
got
a
classic
spirit
and
carries
over
emotionally
,
''
says
Alfred
DeBat
of
Professional
Photographers
of
America
.

``
That
's
the
appeal
.

''
McClatchy
Newspapers
Inc.
said
improvements
in
advertising
and
subscription
revenue
led
to
a
21
%
gain
in
third-quarter
profit
to
$
8.8
million
,
or
31
cents
a
share
,
from
$
7.2
million
,
or
25
cents
a
share
.

Sales
rose
more
than
7
%
to
$
94.9
million
from
$
88.3
million
.

The
Sacramento
,
Calif.
,
company
also
attributed
improved
performance
to
a
lower
effective
tax
rate
and
higher
interest
income
.

For
the
nine
months
,
the
newspaper
chain
had
almost
a
23
%
increase
in
profit
to
$
23.6
million
,
or
83
cents
a
share
,
from
$
19.2
million
,
or
68
cents
a

.

Sales
grew
almost
7
%
to

at

Agip
S.p
.

A.
and
Societe
National
Elf
Aquitaine
,
the
state
oil
companies
of
Italy
and
France
,
respectively
,
submitted
an
offer
to
buy
Gatoil
Suisse
S.A
.

The
price
was
n't
disclosed
.

A
spokesman
for
Gatoil
said
that
the
Swiss
oil
concern
was
examining
the
offer
,
submitted
last
Friday
,
along
with
two
other
offers
,
also
submitted
last
week
.

Those
two
offers
were
private
and
the
spokesman
refused
to
identify
the
bidding
companies
.

The
spokesman
further
said
that
at
least
two
more
offers
are
expected
from
other
companies
within
two
weeks
.

Gatoil
Suisse
owns
an
oil
refinery
in
Switzerland
with
a
capacity
of
70,000
barrels
a
day
,
along
with
a
network
of
gasoline
retailing
outlets
.

While
Friday
's
plunging
stock
market
prompted
new
fears
about
the
economy
's
prospects
,
a
little-known
indicator
that
has
faithfully
foreshadowed
the
economy
's
ups
and
downs
by
exceptionally
long
lead
times
points
to
a
sustained
rise
in
overall
business
activity
.

The
barometer
,
developed
by
analysts
at
Columbia
University
's
Center
for
International
Business
Cycle
Research
here
,
reached
a
record
high
of
223.0
in
August
,
the
latest
month
available
,
and
the
Columbia
researchers
estimate
that
it
has
moved
even
higher
since
then
.

The
latest
reading
of
223.0
was
up
from
222.3
in
July
and
215.3
as
recently
as
March
.

The
August
rise
marked
the
fifth
straight
monthly
gain
for
the
indicator
,
which
uses
the
1967
average
as
a
base
of
100
.

In
contrast
,
the
Commerce
Department
's
widely
followed
index
of
leading
indicators
,
while
up
in
August
,
has
fallen
repeatedly
since
reaching
a
high
early
this
year
.

Its
ragged
behavior
through
much
of
1989
has
prompted
some
forecasters
to
anticipate
the
start
of
a
new
recession
perhaps
before
year
's
end
.

But
the
far
stronger
showing
of
the
Columbia
index
``
makes
a
recession
any
time
soon
highly
unlikely
,
''
says
Geoffrey
H.
Moore
,
the
director
of
the
Columbia
facility
.

A
leading
authority
on
the
business
cycle
,
Mr.
Moore
also
is
a
member
of
the
Business
Cycle
Dating
Group
,
the
panel
of
private
economists
that
decides
for
the
government
when
expansions
and
recessions
begin
and
end
.

The
group
normally
convenes
only
when
a
change
in
the
economy
's
general
course
seems
likely
.

``
No
meeting
is
scheduled
because
the
expansion
shows
no
sign
of
going
off
the
tracks
,
''
Mr.
Moore
reports
.

Based
largely
on
the
recent
strength
in
their
index
,
called
the
long
leading
indicator
,
the
Columbia
analysts
foresee
uninterrupted
economic
growth
through
the
rest
of
this
year
and
next
year
as
well
.

They
expect
a
2.6
%
rise
in
1990
in
the
gross
national
product
,
after
adjustment
for
inflation
.

Underlying
this
optimism
is
the
index
's
longstanding
ability
to
signal
recessions
or
recoveries
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
by
substantially
greater
periods
than
the
Commerce
Department
's
index
of
leading
indicators
.

Over
the
full
post-World
War
II
era
,
the
Columbia
index
,
on
the
average
,
has
entered
sustained
declines
14
months
before
the
onset
of
recessions
and
turned
up
eight
months
before
recoveries
.

The
comparable
lead
times
for
the
Commerce
index
,
whose
components
include
the
stock
market
,
are
far
shorter
--
10
months
before
recessions
and
only
three
months
before
recoveries
.

The
Columbia
economists
also
have
reconstructed
how
the
long
leading
index
would
have
behaved
,
had
it
existed
,
in
1929
,
before
the
stock
market
crash
in
October
that
ushered
in
the
Great
Depression
.

The
indicator
reached
a
peak
in
January
1929
and
then
fell
steadily
up
to
and
through
the
crash
.

``
It
was
an
entirely
different
pattern
from
what
we
're
seeing
now
,
''
Mr.
Moore
says
.

A
major
source
of
the
recent
strength
in
the
long
leading
indicator
has
been
the
performance
of
the
Dow
Jones
corporate
bond-price
index
,
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
Commerce
index
.

In
August
,
the
bond
measure
was
at
its
highest
monthly
average
since
early
1987
.

It
also
rose
last
Friday
,
while
the
stock
market
sagged
.

Other
components
of
the
long
leading
indicator
include
a
ratio
of
prices
to
unit
labor
costs
in
manufacturing
industries
,
the
M2
version
of
the
money
supply
,
adjusted
for
inflation
,
and
the
volume
of
new
home-building
permits
.

Notably
absent
from
the
Columbia
index
is
the
stock
market
,
which
Mr.
Moore
says
``
is
simply
no
longer
such
a
good
indicator
of
the
economy
's
long-range
prospects
,
though
it
still
is
useful
for
anticipating
some
short-run
twists
and
turns
.

''
As
recently
as
1975
,
the
stock
market
--
as
reflected
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
index
of
500
common
stocks
--
was
rated
by
the
National
Bureau
of
Economic
Research
as
the
best
of
the
12
leading
indicators
that
then
made
up
the
Commerce
index
.

It
was
assigned
a
mark
of
80
out
of
a
possible
100
,
compared
with
scores
ranging
as
low
as
69
for
the
other
components
.

The
stock
market
has
lost
some
precursory
power
,
analysts
at
the
Columbia
center
claim
,
because
of
the
growing
impact
of
international
developments
.

``
Stocks
have
become
more
sensitive
to
factors
not
directly
tied
to
the
domestic
economy
,
''
Mr.
Moore
says
,
citing
the
exchange
rate
for
the
dollar
on
currency
markets
,
the
foreign-trade
balance
and
inflows
of
foreign
capital
.

He
also
feels
that
the
rise
of
such
computer-based
practices
as
program
trading
has
diminished
the
stock
market
's
relevancy
to
the
economic
outlook
.

BSN
S.A.
,
a
leading
French
food
group
,
said
it
agreed
to
acquire
Birkel
G.m.b
.

H.
,
a
West
German
pasta
maker
.

The
value
of
the
acquisition
was
n't
disclosed
.

The
move
is
in
line
with
BSN
's
strategy
of
gradually
building
its
share
of
the
European
pasta
market
through
external
growth
.

BSN
will
initially
acquire
a
15
%
interest
in
Birkel
,
a
closely
held
concern
.

The
French
group
has
an
agreement
giving
it
the
right
to
buy
all
the
shares
outstanding
,
and
this
could
be
completed
within
a
few
months
,
a
BSN
spokeswoman
said
.

The
takeover
was
submitted
for
approval
by
the
West
German
cartel
office
,
BSN
said
.

Birkel
is
West
Germany
's
second-biggest
producer
of
pasta
,
with
sales
of
250
million
marks
(
$
133.4
million
)
in
1988
.

It
has
750
workers
at
three
production
units
in
southwest
Germany
,
and
is
that
nation
's
leading
producer
of
pasta
sauces
.

The
acquisition
strengthens
BSN
's
position
in
the
European
pasta
market
.

The
French
group
currently
ranks
second
after
Barilla
Group
of
Italy
,
whose
sales
are
chiefly
in
the
Italian
market
.

Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
it
reduced
its
rating
on
$
281
million
of
senior
and
subordinated
debt
of
this
thrift
holding
company
,
to
C
from
Ca
,
saying
it
believes
bondholders
will
recover
only
``
negligible
principal
.

''
The
agency
said
it
confirmed
American
Continental
's
preferred
stock
rating
at
C
.

American
Continental
's
thrift
unit
,
Los
Angeles-based
Lincoln

Association
,

and
the
parent
company
has
filed
for
protection
from

under
Chapter

of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
.

CENTRUST
SAVINGS
BANK
(
Miami
)
--
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
downgraded
its
ratings
on
the
subordinated
debt
of
CenTrust
to
Caa
from
B-3
.

The
rating
agency
also
reduced
the
ratings
for
long-term
deposits
to
B-3
from
Ba-3
and
for
preferred
stock
to
Ca
from
Caa
.

The
rating
agency
said
about
$
85
million
in
securities
was
affected
.

The
downgrades
were
prompted
,
Moody
's
said
,
by
the
continuing
turmoil
in
the
junk
bond
market
and
the
suspension
of
dividends
on
CenTrust
's
preferred
stock
.

Moody
's
also
said
it
believed
the
proposed
sale
of
63
CenTrust
branches
to
Great
Western
Bank
could
,
if
completed
,
endanger
the
thrift
's
funding
and
market
position
.

THE
STOCK
MARKET
AVOIDED
a
repeat
of
Black
Monday
as
prices
recovered
from
an
early
slide
,
spurred
by
bargain-hunting
institutions
and
program
traders
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrials
closed
up
88.12
points
,
at
2657.38
,
the
fourth-biggest
gain
ever
,
after
being
down
as
much
as
63.52
points
in
the
morning
.

The
rally
erased
about
half
of
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
,
but
analysts
are
cautious
about
the
market
's
outlook
.

The
dollar
also
rebounded
,
while
bond
prices
plummeted
and
Treasury
bill
rates
soared
.

Junk
bonds
also
recovered
somewhat
,
though
trading
remained
stalled
.

Gold
also
rose
.

Tokyo
stock
prices
bounced
back
in
early
trading
Tuesday
following
a
1.8

plunge
on
Monday
.

The
dollar
also
moved
higher
in
Tokyo
.

Donald
Trump
withdrew
his
$
7.54

,
citing
the
``

''
AMR
slid
$
22.125
,
to

Also
,
a

tried
to
get
financing
for
a
lower

,
possibly
$
250
a

.

UAL
fell
$
56.875
,
to

IBM

tumbled
30
%
in
the

,
slightly
more
than

The
computer

cited
a
stronger
dollar
and
a

in
shipping
a
new
high-end
disk
drive
.

Analysts
are
downbeat
about
IBM
's

U.S.
auto
makers
plan
to
decrease

10.4

with
virtually
all
the
decline
coming
from
the
Big

.

Output
at
Japanese-owned

Budget
director

said
he
wo
n't
give
federal
agencies
much
leeway
in
coping
with
Gramm-Rudman
spending
cuts
,
which
took
effect
yesterday
.

Darman
hopes
to
prod
Congress
to
finish
a
deficit
plan
.

The
S&L
bailout
agency
would
be
restricted
by
a
new
bill
in
how
it
raises
capital
.

The
Ways

Means
plan
would
create
another
possible
obstacle
to

sick
thrifts
.

A
natural
gas
rule
was
struck
down
by
a
federal
appeals
court
.

The
regulation
had
prevented
pipeline
firms
from
passing
part
of
$
1
billion
in
costs
along
to
customers
.

The
Supreme
Court
agreed
to
decide
whether
a
federal
court
may
dismantle
a
merger
that
has
won
regulatory
approval
but
been
ruled
anticompetitive
in
a
private
suit
.

Merrill
Lynch
's
profit
slid
37
%
in
the
third

Blue

J.P.

Intel
Corp.
said
it
reached
an
agreement
with
Alliant
Computer
Systems
Corp.
to
develop
software
standards
for
Intel
's
i860
microprocessor
.

The
i860
,
introduced
earlier
this
year
,
is
Intel
's
entry
in
the
crowded
market
for
reduced
instruction
set
computing
,
or
RISC
,
computers
.

Intel
,
based
in
Santa
Clara
,
Calif.
,
is
the
market
leader
for
traditional
microprocessors
with
its
8086
family
that
forms
the
heart
of
IBM-compatible
personal
computers
.

Under
the
agreement
,
Intel
will
invest
$
3
million
to
acquire
a
4
%
stake
in
Alliant
,
a
maker
of
minisupercomputers
for
scientists
and
engineers
.

Alliant
,
based
in
Littleton
,
Mass.
,
will
license
its
parallel-computing
technologies
to
Intel
,
providing
users
a
way
to
let
many
i860
microprocessors
in
a
single
computer
work
on
a
problem
simultaneously
.

Alliant
said
it
plans
to
use
the
microprocessor
in
future
products
.

It
declined
to
discuss
its
plans
for
upgrading
its
current
product
line
.

Omnicare
Inc.
,
which
intends
to
expand
its
position
in
the
medical
and
dental
markets
,
said
it
acquired
a
cotton
and
gauze
products
division
from
closely
held
Sterile
Products
Corp.
for
$
8.2
million
.

Omnicare
said
it
expects
the
division
to
add
``
substantial
sales
volume
and
to
make
a
positive
contribution
to
our
earnings
in
1990
and
beyond
.

''
In
1988
the
Cincinnati
company
earned
$
3.1
million
,
or
32
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
148.5
million
.

Omnicare
said
the
division
operates
under
the
trade
name
ACCO
and
supplies
the
medical
and
dental
markets
.

The
business
,
based
in
St.
Louis
,
had
sales
of
more
than
$
14
million
in
the
fiscal
year
ended

Burmah
Oil
PLC
,
a
British
independent
oil
and
specialty
chemicals
marketing
concern
,
said
SHV
Holdings
N.V.
of
the
Netherlands
has
built
up
a
6.7
%
stake
in
the
company
.

James
Alexander
,
a
Burmah
spokesman
,
said
SHV
had
previously
owned
``
a
little
under
5
%
''
of
Burmah
for
about
two
years
.

The
Dutch
company
had
n't
notified
Burmah
of
its
reason
for
increasing
the
stake
,
he
said
.

SHV
,
which
last
year
merged
its
North
Sea
oil
and
gas
operations
with
those
of
Calor
Group
PLC
,
has
been
pegged
by
speculators
as
a
possible
suitor
for
Burmah
Oil
in
recent
weeks
.

SHV
also
owns
40
%
of
Calor
.

Burmah
,
which
owns
the
Castrol
brand
of
lubricant
oils
,
reported

J.P.
Industries
spokesman
said
the
amount
J.P.
Industries
will
get
for
the
group
is
``
a
little
better
than
expected
by
the
marketplace
,
and
the
marketplace
had
been
expecting
$
25
million
to
$
30
million
.

''
The
group
consists
of
Weslock
Corp.
and
JPI
Modern
Inc
.

J.P.
Industries
,
which
is
based
in
Ann
Arbor
,
Mich.
,
said
the
sale
completes
a
previously
announced
program
to
divest
itself
of
its
hardware
and
plumbing
supplies
operations
.

The
company
's
remaining
business
is
the

applications
.

Citing
a
$
3.1
million
provision
for
doubtful
accounts
,
Dallas-based
National
Heritage
Inc.
posted
a
loss
for
its
fourth
quarter
ended
June
30
.

A
unit
of
troubled
Southmark
Corp.
,
the
operator
of
nursing
homes

retirement
centers
said
it
sustained
a
net
loss
of
$
1.6
million
,
or
nine
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
net
income
of
$
1.3
million
,
or
eight
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Operating
revenue
rose
13
%
to
$
22.2
million
from
$
19.7
million
in
the
year-earlier
quarter
.

The
company
said
the
$
3.1
million
reserve
was
created
to
reflect
doubt
about
the
collectability
of
receivables
owed
to
National
Heritage
by
some
of
the
real

partnerships
it

The

also
said

in

recent
contest
for

were
recognized
primarily
in
the
first
quarter

said
the

said
Bob
Clarke

An
American
journalist
now
is
standing
trial
in
Namibia
.

This
is
the
place
that
world
opinion
has
been
celebrating
over
in
the
expectation
that
it
's
going
to
hold
an
election
.

The
most
likely
winner
will
be
the
Marxist-dominated
SWAPO
rebels
.

The
U.S.
journalist
's
``
crime
''
was
writing
that
the
head
of
the
commission
charged
with
overseeing
the
election
's
fairness
,
Bryan
O'Linn
,
was
openly
sympathetic
to
SWAPO
.

Shortly
after
that
,
Mr.
O'Linn
had
Scott
Stanley
arrested
and
his
passport
confiscated
.

Mr.
Stanley
is
on
trial
over
charges
that
he
violated
a
proclamation
,
issued
by
the
South
African
administrator
general
earlier
this
year
,
which
made
it
a
crime
punishable
by
two
years
in
prison
for
any
person
to
``
insult
,
disparate
or
belittle
''
the
election
commission
.

The
Stanley
affair
does
n't
bode
well
for
the
future
of
democracy
or
freedom
of
anything
in
Namibia
when
SWAPO
starts
running
the
government
.

To
the
extent
Mr.
Stanley
has
done
anything
wrong
,
it
may
be
that
he
is
out
of
step
with
the
consensus
of
world
intellectuals
that
the
Namibian
guerrillas
were
above
all
else
the
victims
of
suppression
by
neighboring
South
Africa
.

SWAPO
has
enjoyed
favorable
Western
media
treatment
ever
since
the
U.N.
General
Assembly
declared
it
the
``
sole
,
authentic
representative
''
of
Namibia
's
people
in
Last
year
,
the
U.S.
brokered
a
peace
settlement
to
remove
Cuba
's
``
Afrika
Korps
''
from
Angola
and
hold
``
free
and
fair
''
elections
that
would
end
South
Africa
's
control
of
Namibia
.

The
elections
are
set
for
Nov.
7
.

In
July
,
Mr.
Stanley
,
editor
of
American
Press
International
,
a
Washington
D.C.-based
conservative
wire
service
,
visited
Namibia
to
report
on
the
U.N.-monitored
election
campaign
.

He
interviewed
Mr.
O'Linn
,
head
of
a
commission
charged
with
investigating
electoral
intimidation
,
and
reported
that
Mr.
O'Linn
was
openly
sympathetic
to
SWAPO
and
indeed
had
defended
its
leaders
in
court
.

After
Mr.
Stanley
's
article
was
published
in
two
Namibian
newspapers
,
Mr.
O'Linn
had
criminal
charges
brought
against
their
editors
,
publisher
and
lawyer
.

Mr.
Stanley
was
arrested
and
charged
along
with
the
others
when
he
returned
to
Namibia
this
month
.

Both
the
State
Department
and
the
Lawyers
Committee
for
Freedom
of
the
Press
have
protested
Mr.
Stanley
's
detention
.

Mr.
Stanley
's
arrest
is
the
latest
in
a
series
of
incidents
that
threaten
to
derail
Namibia
's
elections
.

Both
South
African
and
SWAPO
extremists
are
intimidating
voters
.

The
U.S.
is
in
the
habit
of
arranging
peace
settlements
and
then
washing
its
hands
over
the
tragic
results
.

It
now
has
the
chance
to
redress
that
record
in
Namibia
.

State
and
the
human-rights
community
should
insist
that
Mr.
Stanley
and
his
fellow
defendants
be
released
and
that
the
United
Nation
's
monitors
make
certain
that
Mr.
O'Linn's
commission
investigates
election
complaints
from
all
sides
.

Commodity
futures
prices
generally
reflected
the
stability
of
the
stock
market
following
its
plunge
Friday
.

Yesterday
,
the
stock
market
's
influence
at
first
created
nervousness
.

Later
,
however
,
it
became
more
of
an
undercurrent
than
a
dominating
force
as
individual
markets
reacted
more
to
their
own
factors
.

Gold
,
the
traditional
haven
in
times
of
financial
crisis
,
continued
its
inverse
lockstep
with
the
dollar
,
rising
early
in
the
day
as
the
currency
fell
,
and
then
giving
up
some
of
its
gains
as
the
dollar
recovered
.

Copper
and
crude
oil
reacted
sharply
to
the
concern
that
a
crash
yesterday
could
have
a
potentially
devastating
effect
on
the
economy
.

Copper
fell
and
showed
little
rebound
through
the
day
as
one
of
the
major
supply
problems
that
had
been
supporting
prices
appeared
to
be
solved
.

Crude
oil
declined
early
,
but
as
the
stock
market
retained
early
gains
,
it
,
too
,
became
stronger
,
ending
with
a
small
net
loss
.

Trading
in
cotton
and
sugar
was
nervous
and
showed
small
declines
.

In
Chicago
,
grain
and
soybean
prices
rose
slightly
.

Livestock
and
meat
prices
,
however
,
dropped
on
concern
that
a
financial
crisis
would
cut
consumption
of
beef
and
pork
.

In
commodity
markets
yesterday
:
PRECIOUS
METALS
:
Futures
prices
were
moderately
higher
as
gold
gave
up
some
of
its
early
gains
and
platinum
behaved
independently
,
first
falling
and
then
later
rising
.

Silver
performed
quietly
.

The
spot
October
gold
price
rose
$
4
to
$
367.30
an
ounce
.

The
more
active
December
delivery
gold
settled
with
a
gain
of
$
3.90
an
ounce
at
$
371.20
,
after
trading
as
high
as
$
374
.

December
silver
was
up
2.3
cents
an
ounce
at
$
5.163
.

Platinum
behaved
more
like
an
industrial
metal
,
easing
early
on
concern
over
a
possible
weaker
economy
,
but
recovering
later
,
as
the
stock
market
strengthened
.

Gold
was
nowhere
the
spectacular
performer
it
was
two
years
ago
on
Black
Monday
.

For
one
thing
,
last
Friday
,
precious
metals
markets
closed
before
the
stock
market
went
into
its
late-in-the-day
nose
dive
,
so
it
could
n't
react
to
it
.

Back
on
Friday
,
Oct.
16
,
l987
,
the
stock
market
declined
during
the
day
,
and
gold
prices
surged
as
the
stock
market
fell
.

The
October
1987
contract
that
day
rose
as
much
as
$
8.70
to
as
high
as
$
471.60
,
and
the
more
deferred
positions
,
due
to
mature
as
late
as
March
1989
,
rose
as
much
as
$
9.60
.

On
Black
Monday
,
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
the
October
contract
tacked
on
further
gains
,
rising
to
as
high
as
$
491.50
for
a
gain
of
almost
$
20
on
top
of
the
Friday
advances
,
before
giving
up
almost
$
10
of
that
at
the
close
.

Yesterday
's
October
gain
of
$
4
was
miniscule
compared
with
that
.

One
analyst
,
Peter
Cardillo
of
Josephthal
&
Co.
,
New
York
,
said
the
gold
market
already
had
some
good
price-supporting
technical
factors
that
would
have
caused
prices
to
rise
,
with
or
without
the
stock
market
.

``
What
the
stock
market
did
was
cause
the
rise
to
take
place
earlier
than
it
would
have
happened
,
''
said
Mr.
Cardillo
.

There
's
a
good
chance
that
gold
will
retain
its
gains
and
rise
further
,
he
said
.

He
expects
a
drop
in
interest
rates
,
which
would
help
gold
by
keeping
the
dollar
from
rising
.

Finally
,
according
to
Mr.
Cardillo
,
the
impact
of
the
strong
dollar
should
be
reflected
in
reduced
exports
in
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
when
the
figures
are
released
today
.

This
would
be
damaging
to
the
dollar
and
supportive
for
gold
,
he
said
.

ENERGY
:
Worried
that
Friday
's
190-point
stock
market
plunge
might
be
a
harbinger
of
things
to
come
for
the
economy
,
petroleum
futures
traders
called
a
halt
to
the
recent
string
of
increases
in
crude
oil
futures
prices
.

The
U.S.
benchmark
crude
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
,
closed
at
$
20.59
a
barrel
for
November
delivery
,
down
30
cents
.

Some
analysts
said
crude
was
due
for
a
correction
anyhow
,
following
several
days
of
significant
gains
.

But
most
market
observers
agreed
that
Friday
's
stock
market
drop
is
what
dampened
spirits
in
the
petroleum
pits
yesterday
.

Until
yesterday
,
futures
prices
had
been
headed
up
on
expectations
that
world
oil
demand
will
continue
to
be
strong
.

The
Organization
of
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
increased
its
production
ceiling
for
the
fourth
quarter
based
on
projections
of
robust
demand
.

So
any
bearish
indicator
,
such
as
Friday
's
precipitous
drop
in
the
stock
market
,
sends
shivers
through
the
oil
markets
as
well
.

Indeed
,
after
reacting
early
in
the
trading
day
to
Friday
's
plummet
,
futures
prices
firmed
up
again
as
traders
took
note
of
the
stock
market
's
partial
recovery
yesterday
.

COPPER
:
Futures
prices
fell
and
showed
little
rebound
as
one
major
labor
problem
that
had
been
underpinning
prices
appeared
to
be
solved
.

The
December
contract
declined
3.05
cents
a
pound
to
$
1.2745
.

Prices
were
down
from
the
outset
of
trading
on
concern
that
a
drop
in
the
stock
market
might
create
a
weakened
economy
and
a
consequent
reduction
in
copper
use
.

But
the
recovery
in
the
stock
market
provided
little
help
for
copper
as
word
spread
that
a
three-month
strike
at
the
Highland
Valley
mine
in
British
Columbia
was
about
over
,
according
to
an
analyst
.

Highland
Valley
is
a
large
Canadian
producer
and
principal
supplier
to
Japan
,
which
recently
began
seeking
copper
elsewhere
as
its
inventories
shrank
.

Last
week
it
was
reported
that
company
and
union
negotiations
had
overcome
the
major
hurdle
,
the
contracting
out
of
work
by
the
company
.

Now
,
the
analyst
said
,
only
minor
points
remain
to
be
cleaned
up
.

``
For
all
intents
and
purposes
,
an
agreement
appears
to
have
been
achieved
,
''
he
said
.

Copper
inventories
in
New
York
's
Commodity
Exchange
warehouses
rose
yesterday
by
516
tons
,
to
10,004
tons
.

London
Metal
Exchange
copper
inventories
last
week
declined
13,575
tons
,
to
89,300
tons
.

The
LME
stocks
decline
was
about
as
expected
,
but
the
Comex
gain
was
n't
.

However
,
this
was
brushed
aside
by
concern
over
the
stock
market
,
the
analyst
said
.

At
one
point
in
futures
trading
,
as
the
stock
market
firmed
,
the
December
contract
rose
to
as
high
as
$
1.2965
,
but
it
was
n't
able
to
sustain
the
gain
.

``
It
was
simply
overbought
,
''
he
said
,
and
selling
by
funds
that
are
computer
guided
helped
depress
prices
.

COTTON
:
Futures
prices
eased
,
more
in
reaction
to
Hurricane
Jerry
than
to
any
influence
of
the
stock
market
.

The
December
contract
ended
with
a
loss
of
0.22
cent
a
pound
,
at
74.48
cents
.

Technical
considerations
following
the
hurricane
,
which
was
a
factor
in
the
market
Friday
,
caused
prices
to
decline
yesterday
,
said
Ernest
Simon
,
cotton
specialist
for
Prudential-Bache
Securities
,
New
York
.

Prices
rose
sharply
Friday
as
the
storm
approached
Texas
and
Louisiana
,
which
is
part
of
the
Mississippi
Delta
cotton-growing
area
.

However
,
after
absorbing
the
potential
effect
of
the
hurricane
,
prices
began
to
slip
late
Friday
,
Mr.
Simon
said
.

That
selling
continued
yesterday
and
kept
prices
under
pressure
,
he
said
.

Colder
weather
is
being
predicted
for
the
high
plains
of
Texas
and
the
northern
states
of
the
Delta
during
the
coming
weekend
,
Mr.
Simon
said
.

That
has
n't
yet
captured
traders
'
attention
,
he
added
.

SUGAR
:
Futures
prices
declined
.

The
March
contract
was
off
0.32
cent
a
pound
at
13.97
cents
.

At
one
point
in
early
trading
the
March
price
rose
to
as
high
as
14.22
cents
when
the
stock
market
recovered
,
but
the
price
then
fell
back
.

A
price-depressing
factor
,
one
analyst
said
,
was
that
India
,
which
had
been
expected
to
buy
around
200,000
tons
of
sugar
in
the
world
market
,
did
n't
make
any
purchases
.

India
recently
bought
200,000
tons
and
was
expected
to
buy
more
,
the
analyst
said
.

Another
analyst
thought
that
India
may
have
pulled
back
because
of
the
concern
over
the
stock
market
.

``
India
may
have
felt
that
if
there
was
a
severe
drop
in
the
stock
market
and
it
affected
sugar
,
it
could
buy
at
lower
prices
,
''
said
Judith
Ganes
,
analyst
for
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
,
New
York
.

At
any
rate
,
she
added
,
``
India
needs
the
sugar
,
so
it
will
be
in
sooner
or
later
to
buy
it
.

''
FARM
PRODUCTS
:
The
prices
of
cattle
and
hog
futures
contracts
dropped
sharply
because
traders
speculated
that
the
stock
market
plunge
Friday
will
linger
in
the
minds
of
U.S.
consumers
long
enough
to
prompt
them
to
rein
in
their
spending
at
the
supermarket
,
which
would
hurt
demand
for
beef
and
pork
.

The
price
of
the
hog
contract
for
October
delivery
dropped
its
maximum
permissible
daily
limit
of
1.5
cents
a
pound
.

The
prices
of
most
grain
futures
contracts
rose
slightly
yesterday
out
of
relief
that
the
stock
market
was
showing
signs
of
recovering
.

Earlier
in
the
session
,
the
prices
of
several
soybean
contracts
set
new
lows
.

A
broad
rally
began
when
several
major
processors
began
buying
futures
contracts
,
apparently
to
take

Knight-Ridder
Inc.
said
it
would
report
increased
earnings
per
share
for
the
third
quarter
,
contrary
to
reported
analysts
'
comments
that
the
publishing
company
's
earnings
would
be
down
.

A
company
spokesman
said
he
believed
the
confusion
was
caused
when
James
Batten
,
Knight-Ridder
's
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
told
New
York
analysts
two
weeks
ago
that
Knight-Ridder
's
earnings
per
share
for
the
first
nine
months
of
1989
would
``
be
behind
a
little
bit
''

The
Knight-Ridder
spokesman
said
the
third-quarter
earnings
that
the
company
plans
to
report
Oct.
24
are
expected
to
be
up
.

The
spokesman
said
he
was
``
comfortable
''
with
revised
analysts
'
projections
that
the
company
would
report
earnings
of
between
62
cents
and
64
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
the
53
cents
a
share
it
reported
for
the
1988
third
quarter
.

Knight-Ridder
said
it
agreed
with
estimates
that
net
income
for
all
of
1989
would
be
around
$
2.86
a
share
,
compared
with
$
2.59

said
it
extended
its
$
45-a-share
offer
for

not
to

said
that

already
owns
15

that
as
of

riding
above
the
turbulence
that
has
troubled
most
of
the
thrift
industry
,
posted
a
16
%
increase
of
third-quarter
earnings
to
$
41.8
millon
,
or
66
cents
a
share

Herbert
M.
Sandler
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Oakland
,
Calif.
,
savings-and-loan
holding
company
,
credited
the
high
number
of
loans
added
to
the
company
's
portfolio
over
the
last
12
months
for
broadening
its
earning
asset
base
and
improving
profit
performance
.

However
,
the
executive
noted
that
slackening
demand
for
new
mortgages
depressed
new
loan
originations
to
$
1
billion
,
30
%
below
the
same
period
last
year
.

In
savings
activity
,
Mr.
Sandler
said
consumer
deposits
have
enjoyed
a
steady
increase
throughout
1989
,
and
topped
$
11
billion
at
quarter
's
end
for
the
first
time
in
the
company
's
history
.

Deposit
growth
amounted
to
$
393
million
,
more
than
double
the
year-ago
figure
.

Whirlpool
Corp.
,
Benton
Harbor
,
Mich.
,
said
it
has
developed
a
process
to
recover
environmentally
harmful
chlorofluorocarbons
,
or
CFCs
,
that
previously
entered
the
atmosphere
during
in-home
repair
of
refrigerators
and
freezers
.

The
maker
of
home
appliances
said
the
process
,
which
involves
the
use
of
a
multilayer
plastic
bag
during
repairs
to
capture
the
gaseous
substance
and
transport
it
to
a
recycling
center
,
is
already
in
use
at
a
number
of
its
service
centers
,
and
will
be
available
to
all
authorized
repair
centers
by
spring
.

Earlier
repairs
vented
the
CFCs
out
of
the
home
through
a
hose
directly
into
the
atmosphere
.

CFCs
are
widely
used
as
solvents
,
coolants
and
fire
suppressants
.

But
their
use
has
been
linked
to
a
potentially
dangerous
depletion
of
the
Earth
's
ozone
layer
,
and
a
number
of
companies
are
seeking
to
curtail
use
,
or
at
least
emission
,
of
the
substance
.

Whirpool
said
,
``
We
see
this
process
as
a
small
but
important
step
toward
eventual
elimination
of
CFC
use
in
appliance
manufacture

Maxus

it
discovered
a

field
northeast
of

Maxus
said
it
did

run
a

on
the
three
discovery
wells
it
drilled
in
the
field
,
which
is
about
1.6
miles
from
the
Intan
Field
,
because
the
wells
are
similar
to
others
drilled
at
its
Intan

Widuri
fields
.

However
,
Maxus
said
it
believes
the
reserves
in

has
estimated

for

Net
for

The

previously
reported
net
of

The

said
that
for
financial

purposes
last

it
took
tax
credits
that
will
be
recognized

But
because

,
it
took
those

again

Jack
W.
Forrest

the

the

effective
tax

about
35

purchase
the
Electro-Optics
Technology
division

Terms
of
the
agreement
were

disclosed

But
for
the
fiscal
year
ended
July
31
,
1988
,
the
most
recent
period
for
which
results
were
broken
out
,
the
Perkin-Elmer
unit
accounted
for
more
than
half
the
$
145
million
in
sales
recorded
by
the
company
's
government
systems
sector
.

Perkin-Elmer
,
which
is
based
in
Norwalk
,
Conn.
,
said
the
sale
of
the
Danbury
,
Conn.
,
unit
is
consistent
with
its
restructuring
strategy
announced
in
April
.

In
addition
to
making
electro-optical
systems
,
the
unit
also
makes
laser
warning
receivers
.

These
are
used
aboard
military
helicopters
to
warn
pilots
that
a
laser
weapon
has
been
focused
on
them
.

Hughes
of
Los
Angeles
said
the
PerkinElmer
unit
's
work
complements
efforts
by
its
Electro-Optical
and
Data
Systems
group
,
which
makes
infrared
sensors
,
military
lasers
and
night
vision
equipment
.

Hughes
said
it
expects
the
sale
to
close
by
year
end
.

The
Communications
Workers
of
America
ratified
a
new
regional
contract
and
all
but
one
of
the
local
agreements
with
Bell
Atlantic
Corp
.

CWA
's
New
Jersey
Commercial
local
,
which
represents
about
2,500
service
representatives
and
marketing
employees
,
rejected
the
tentative
agreement
.

Both
the
union
and
the
regional
telephone
company
said
they
were
working
together
to
resolve
differences
.

The
new
three-year
contracts
,
which
replace
ones
that
expired
Aug.
5
,
cover
41,000
Bell
Atlantic
employees
.

The
ratification
follows
a
23-day
strike
against
the
Philadelphia-based
company
.

Meanwhile
,
CWA
and
International
Brotherhood
of
Electrical
Workers
members
remain
on
strike
against
Nynex
Corp.
,
the
New
York-based
regional
phone
company
.

The
unions
and
the
company
last
week
agreed
to
mediation
.

The
CWA
represents
40,000
Nynex
workers
and
the
IBEW
represents
20,000
workers

For
the
moment
,
at
least
,
euphoria
has
replaced
anxiety
on
Wall
Street
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
jumped
sharply
yesterday
to
close
at
2657.38
,
panic
did
n't
sweep
the
world
's
markets
,
and
investors
large
and
small
seemed
to
accept
Friday
's
dizzying
190-point
plunge
as
a
sharp
correction
,
not
a
calamity
.

Many
went
bargain-hunting
.

Among
those
sighing
with
relief
was
John
H.
Gutfreund
,
chairman
of
Salomon
Brothers
,
who
took
to
the
firm
's
trading
floor
to
monitor
yesterday
's
events
.

As
the
rally
gained
strength
at
3:15
p.m.
,
he
smiled
broadly
,
brandished
his
unlit
cigar
and
slapped
Stanley
Shopkorn
,
his
top
stock
trader
,
on
the
back
.

At
first
,
it
seemed
as
if
history
might
repeat
itself
.

As
trading
opened
yesterday
morning
on
the
Big
Board
,
stocks
of
many
of
the
nation
's
biggest
companies
could
n't
open
for
trading
because
a
wave
of
sell
orders
was
overwhelming
buyers
.

By
10:10
,
the
Dow
Industrials
were
off
63.52
points
,
and
the
stock
of
UAL
Corp.
,
whose
troubles
had
kicked
off
Friday
's
plunge
,
still
had
n't
opened
.

But
then
,
as
quickly
as
the
Dow
had
fallen
,
it
began
to
turn
around
.

It
ended
with
a
gain
of
88.12
points
.

By
the
market
's
close
,
volume
on
the
New
York
exchange
totaled
more
than
416
million
,
the
fourth
highest
on
record
.

The
Big
Board
handled
the
huge
volume
without
any
obvious
strain
,
in
sharp
contrast
to
Black
Monday
of
1987
.

But
the
rally
was
largely
confined
to
the
blue-chip
stocks
,
which
had
been
hard
hit
during
Friday
's
selling
frenzy
.

Overall
,
more
Big
Board
stocks
lost
money
than
gained
.

And
many
arbitragers
,
already
reeling
from
Friday
's
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
,
were
further
hurt
yesterday
when
a
proposed
takeover
of
AMR
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
,
collapsed
.

Indeed
,
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
plunged
102.06
points
,
its
second-worst
drop
in
history
.

World-wide
,
trading
was
generally
manageable
.

The
Frankfurt
stock
exchange
was
hardest
hit
of
the
major
markets
,
with
blue
chips
there
falling
12.8
%
.

In
London
,
a
midday
rally
left
the
market
's
major
index
off
3.2
%
,
and
Tokyo
's
leading
stock
index
fell
only
1.8
%
in
surprisingly
lackluster
trading
.

Other
,
more
thinly
traded
Asian
markets
were
hit
harder
than
Tokyo
's
,
but
there
were
no
free-fall
declines
.

Investors
big
and
small
say
they
learned
valuable
lessons
since
the
1987
crash
:
In
this
age
of
computerized
trading
,
huge
corrections
or
runups
in
a
few
hours
'
time
must
be
expected
.

What
's
more
,
such
short-term
cataclysms
are
survivable
and
are
no
cause
for
panic
selling
.

Stephen
Boesel
,
a
major
money
manager
for
T.
Rowe
Price
in
Baltimore
,
says
,
``
There
was
less
panic
than
in
1987
:
We
had
been
through
it
once
.

''
In
Somerset
,
Wis.
,
Adrian
Sween
,
who
owns
a
supplier
of
nursing-home
equipment
and
is
n't
active
in
the
stock
market
,
agrees
.

``
I
look
at
it
as
a
ho-hum
matter
,
''
he
says
.

Many
other
factors
played
a
part
in
yesterday
's
comeback
.

The
Federal
Reserve
signaled
its
willingness
to
provide
liquidity
;
the
interest
rate
on
its
loans
to
major
banks
inched
downward
early
in
the
day
.

Foreign
stock
markets
,
which
kicked
off
Black
Monday
with
a
huge
selling
spree
,
began
the
day
off
by
relatively
modest
amounts
.

The
dollar
,
after
falling
sharply
in
overnight
trading
to
139.10
yen
,
bounced
back
strongly
to
141.8
,
thus
easing
fears
that
foreigners
would
unload
U.S.
stocks
.

And
the
widely
disseminated
opinion
among
most
market
experts
that
a
crash
was
n't
in
store
also
helped
calm
investors
.

Many
major
institutions
,
for
example
,
came
into
work
yesterday
ready
to
buy
some
of
the
blue
chips
they
felt
had
been
sharply
undervalued
on
Friday
.

Still
,
amid
all
the
backslapping
and
signs
of
relief
over
yesterday
's
events
,
some
market
professionals
cautioned
that
there
is
nothing
present
in
the
current
market
system
to
prevent
another
dizzying
drop
such
as
Friday
's
.

``
There
is
too
much
complacency
,
''
says
money
manager
Barry
Schrager
.

Computers
have
increasingly
connected
securities
markets
world-wide
,
so
that
a
buying
or
selling
wave
in
one
market
is
often
passed
around
the
globe
.

So
investors
everywhere
nervously
eyed
yesterday
's
opening
in
Tokyo
,
where
the
Nikkei
average
of
225
blue-chip
stocks
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
.

The
average
plunged
some
600
points
,
or
1.7
%
,
in
the
first
20
minutes
of
trading
.

But
the
selling
wave
had
no
conviction
,
and
the
market
first
surged
upward
by
200
points
,
then
drifted
lower
,
closing
down
647
.

Unlike
two
years
ago
,
most
of
Japan
's
major
investors
chose
to
sit
this
calamity
out
.

In
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
's
Tokyo
trading
room
,
some
40
traders
and
assistants
sat
quietly
,
with
few
orders
to
process
.

Clients
``
are
all
staying
out
''
of
the
market
,
one
Merrill
trader
says
.

The
relative
calm
in
Tokyo
proved
little
comfort
to
markets
opening
up
in
Europe
.

Frankfurt
's
opening
was
delayed
a
half
hour
because
of
a
crush
of
sell
orders
.

``
The
beginning
was
chaotic
,
''
says
Nigel
Longley
,
a
broker
for
Commerzbank
In
London
,
the
view
from
the
trading
floor
of
an
American
securities
firm
,
Jefferies
&
Co.
,
also
was
troubling
.

A
computer
screen
displaying
100
blue-chip
stocks
colors
each
one
red
when
its
price
is
falling
.

The
screen
was
a
sea
of
red
.

``
I
see
concern
,
but
I
do
n't
see
panic
,
''
says
J.
Francis
Palamara
,
a
New
Yorker
who
runs
the
15-trader
office
.

London
's
blue-chip
stock
index
turned
up
just
before
8
a.m
.

New
York
time
,
sending
an
encouraging
message
to
Wall
Street
.

When
trading
opened
in
New
York
at
9:30
a.m.
EDT
,
stocks
fell
sharply
--
as
expected
.

Futures
markets
in
Chicago
had
opened
at
a
level
suggesting
the
Dow
would
fall
by
about
60
points
.

With
sell
orders
piled
up
from
Friday
,
about
half
the
stocks
in
the
Dow
could
n't
open
on
time
.

By
9:45
,
the
industrial
average
had
dropped
27
points
.

By
10
a.m.
,
it
was
down
49
.

Ten
minutes
later
,
the
Dow
hit
bottom
-
down
63.52
points
,
another
2.5
%
.

But
shortly
before
then
,
some
of
Wall
Street
's
sharpest
traders
say
,
they
sensed
a
turn
.

``
The
first
thing
that
caught
my
eye
that
was
encouraging
was
Treasury
bonds
were
off
,
''
says
Austin
George
,
head
of
stock
trading
at
T.
Rowe
Price
.

``
It
meant
that
people
were
n't
running
pell-mell
to
the
safety
of
bonds
.

''
Shortly
after
10
a.m.
,
the
Major
Market
Index
,
a
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
futures
contract
of
20
stocks
designed
to
mimic
the
DJIA
,
exploded
upward
.

Stock
traders
were
buoyed
--
because
an
upturn
in
the
MMI
had
also
started
the
recovery
in
stocks
on
the
Tuesday
following
Black
Monday
.

``
The
MMI
has
gone
better
,
''
shouted
a
trader
in
the
London
office
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Shearson
's
London
trading
room
went
wild
.

Traders
shouted
out
as
their
Reuters
,
Quotron
and
Telerate
screens
posted
an
ever-narrowing
loss
on
Wall
Street
.

Then
,
nine
minutes
later
,
Wall
Street
suddenly
rebounded
to
a
gain
on
the
day
.

``
Rally
,
rally
,
rally
,
''
shouted
Shearson
's
Andy
Rosen
.

``
This
is
panic
buying
.

''
Major
blue-chip
stocks
like
Philip
Morris
,
General
Motors
and
Proctor
&
Gamble
led
the
rally
.

Japanese
were
said
to
be
heavy
buyers
.

German
and
Dutch
investors
reportedly
loaded
up
on
Kellogg
Co
.

Then
,
traders
say
,
corporations
with
share
buy-back
programs
kicked
into
high
gear
,
triggering
gains
in
,
among
other
issues
,
Alcan
Aluminium
and
McDonald
's
.

Walt
Disney
Co.
,
which
had
one
of
the
biggest
sell-order
imbalances
on
Friday
and
was
one
of
seven
stocks
that
halted
trading
and
never
reopened
that
day
,
opened
yesterday
late
at
114.5
,
down
8.5
.

But
then
it
suddenly
burst
upward
7.5
as
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
stepped
in
and
bought
almost
every
share
offer
,
traders
said
.

By
10:25
,
the
Dow
had
turned
up
for
the
day
,
prompting
cheers
on
trading
desks
and
exchange
floors
.

Among
Big
Board
specialists
,
the
cry
was
``
Pull
your
offers
''
--
meaning
that
specialists
soon
expected
to
get
higher
prices
for
their
shares
.

``
It
was
bedlam
on
the
upside
,
''
said
one
Big
Board
specialist
.

``
What
we
had
was
a
real
,
old-fashioned
rally
.

''
This
technical
strength
spurred
buying
from
Wall
Street
's
``
black
boxes
,
''
computer
programs
designed
to
trigger
large
stock
purchases
during
bullish
periods
.

Typical
,
perhaps
,
was
Batterymarch
's
Dean
LeBaron
.

Mr.
LeBaron
,
who
manages
$
10
billion
,
says
,
``
We
turned
the
trading
system
on
,
and
it
did
whatever
it
was
programmed
to
do
.

''
Asked
what
stocks
the
computer
bought
,
the
money
manager
says
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.

''
Not
everybody
was
making
money
.

The
carnage
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
the
nation
's
major
options
market
,
was
heavy
after
the
trading
in
S&P
100
stock-index
options
was
halted
Friday
.

Many
market
makers
in
the
S&P
100
index
options
contract
had
bullish
positions
Friday
,
and
when
the
shutdown
came
they
were
frozen
with
huge
losses
.

Over
the
weekend
,
clearing
firms
told
the
Chicago
market
makers
to
get
out
of
their
positions
at
any
cost
Monday
morning
.

``
They
were
absolutely
killed
,
slaughtered
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
options
trader
.

Meanwhile
,
a
test
of
the
stock
market
's
rally
came
at
about
2
p.m.
,
with
the
Dow
at
2600
,
up
31
points
on
the
day
.

Charles
Clough
,
a
strategist
at
Merrill
Lynch
,
says
bargain
hunting
had
explained
the
Dow
's
strength
up
to
that
point
and
that
many
market
professionals
were
anticipating
a
drop
in
the
Dow
.

Moreover
,
the
announcement
that
real
estate
magnate
and
sometime
raider
Donald
Trump
was
withdrawing
his
offer
for
AMR
Corp.
might
have
been
expected
to
rattle
traders
.

Instead
,
the
rally
only
paused
for
about
25
minutes
and
then
steamed
forward
as
institutions
resumed
buying
.

The
market
closed
minutes
after
reaching
its
high
for
the
day
of
Across
the
country
,
many
people
took
yesterday
's
events
in
stride
,
while
remaining
generally
uneasy
about
the
stock
market
in
general
.

Says
James
Norman
,
the
mayor
of
Ava
,
Mo.
:
``
I
do
n't
invest

I
much
prefer
money
I
can
put
my
hands
on

''
While
Mayor
Norman
found
the
market
's
performance
Monday
reassuring
,
he
says
,
he
remains
uneasy
.

``
We
have
half
the
experts
saying
one
thing
and
half
the
other
''
about
the
course
of
the
economy
.

Ralph
Holzfaster
,
a
farmer
and
farm-supply
store
operator
in
Ogallala
,
Neb.
,
says
of
the
last
few
days
events
,
``
If
anything
good
comes
out
of
this
,
it
might
be
that
it
puts
some

conditioned
on

Kan.-based
National

the

credit
agreement

In
national
over-the-counter
trading
,
Skipper

rose
50

proposal
from
National

and
Pizza

questioned
whether
the
purchase
would
violate

franchise
agreements

National
Pizza
said
it
settled
its
dispute
with
Pizza

allowing
it
to
make
the
purchase
.

Also
,
Skipper
's
results
began
to
turn
around

EAST
GERMANS
RALLIED
as
officials
reportedly
sought
Honecker
's
ouster

In
what
was
considered
the
largest
protest
in
the
Communist
state
's
40-year
history
,
at
least
120,000
demonstrators
marched
through
the
southern
city
of
Leipzig
to
press
demands
for
democratic
freedoms
,
opposition
activists
said
.

Police
did
n't
intervene
.

Meanwhile
,
as
the
first
of
more
than
1,300
East
Germans
trying
to
flee

their
citizenship
,
a
West
German
newspaper
reported
that

demanded
the
dismissal
of

routes
within
the
continental
U.S.

on
flights
of
less
than
six
hours
to
Alaska

The
curbs
would
cover
all

Co.
for
about
$
600
million
to
Bidermann
S.A.
,
a
closely
held
clothing
maker
based
in
Paris
.

Shortly
after
completing
the
$
1.56
billion
acquisition
of
West
Point-Pepperell
Inc.
in
April
,
Mr.
Farley
's
holding
company
,
Farley
Inc.
,
said
it
was
considering
the
sale
of
Cluett
,
a
leading
shirt
maker
and
one
of
West
Point-Pepperell
's
biggest
units
.

Included
in
the
sale
are
Cluett
units
that
make
men
's
shirts
under
the
Arrow
name
,
socks
under
the
Gold
Toe
name
and
menswear
through
the
Schoeneman
division
.

The
companies
said
the
agreement
is
subject
to
Bidermann
's
receipt
of
financing
and
to
regulatory
and
other
approvals
.

They
said
the
sale
is
expected
to
be
concluded
by
the
end
of
November
.

Mr.
Farley
said
the
sale
of
three
of
Cluett
's
four
main
divisions
plus
other
``
anticipated
''
West
Point-Pepperell
asset
sales
by
December
,
should
bring
in
a
total
of
about
$
700
million
.

He
did
n't
elaborate
on
other
asset
sales
being
considered
.

Mr.
Farley
followed
a
similar
pattern
when
he
acquired
Northwest
Industries
Inc.
and
then
sold
much
of
its
assets
.

But
he
kept
Fruit
of
the
Loom
Inc.
,
the
underwear
maker
that
he
still
controls
and
serves
as
chairman
and
chief
executive
.

Cluett
was
an
independent
company
until
West
Point-Pepperell
acquired
it
for
$
375
million
in
cash
and
stock
in
1986
.

In
the
fiscal
year
ended
Sept.
30
,
1988
,
Cluett
had
operating
profit
of
$
37
million
on
sales
of
$
757
million
.

Bidermann
sells
clothes
under
various
labels
,
including
Yves
Saint
Laurent
and
Bill
Robinson
for
men
and
Ralph
Lauren
for
women
.

A
spokesman
said
the
company
had
sales
of
$
400
million
in
1988
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
,
West
Point-Pepperell
fell
25
cents
to
$
53.875
.

Britain
's
Blue
Arrow
PLC
intends
to
change
its
name
to
Manpower
PLC
and
write
off
a
chunk
of
the
nearly
$
1.2
billion
in
good
will
realized
in
the
takeover
of
U.S.-based
Manpower
Inc
.

Blue
Arrow
Chairman
Mitchell
Fromstein
said
in
an
interview
that
the
two
steps
may
be
a
prelude
to
reincorporating
the
world
's
biggest
employment-services
group
in
the
U.S
.

Mr.
Fromstein
disclosed
the
planned
steps
,
expected
within
a
few
months
,
as
Blue
Arrow
posted
a
2.5
%
drop
in
its
third-quarter
pretax
earnings
.

The
name
change
and
good
will
write-off
could
help
solidify
Blue
Arrow
's
dominance
of
the
U.S.
temporary-help
market
and
give
it
a
more
American
image
as
U.S.
investors
turn
jittery
about
foreign
stocks
after
Friday
's
market
plunge
.

U.S.
holders
now
own
more
than
60
%
of
Blue
Arrow
compared
with
9
%
last
January
.

``
In
the
U.S.
market
,
the
recognition
of
the
Manpower
name
is
infinitely
stronger
than
Blue
Arrow
,
''
Mr.
Fromstein
said
.

The
moves
also
could
erase
shareholders
'
perception
of
Blue
Arrow
as
a
company
in
turmoil
.

``
It
further
reinforces
the
concept
that
Blue
Arrow
is
a
thing
of
the
past
,
''
said
Doug
Arthur
,
an
analyst
at
Kidder
Peabody
&
Co.
in
New
York
.

The
proposed
changes
``
all
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
me
,
''
he
added
.

In
a
widely
publicized
boardroom
coup
,
Mr.
Fromstein
ousted
Antony
Berry
as
Blue
Arrow
chief
executive
in
January
,
a
month
after
Mr.
Berry
had
forced
Mr.
Fromstein
out
as
the
$
1
million-a-year
chief
of
Milwaukee-based
Manpower
.

Mr.
Fromstein
solidified
his
control
in
April
by
taking
over
from
Mr.
Berry
as
chairman
.

But
the
Blue
Arrow
tumult
is
n't
over
yet
,
as
the
British
government
is
investigating
a
disputed
#
25
million
(
$
39.4
million
)
loan
which
Mr.
Fromstein
has
said
was
made
under
Mr.
Berry
's
direction
.

Blue
Arrow
was
able
to
pull
off
the
$
1.34
billion
takeover
of
Manpower
in
1987
largely
because
different
British
and
American
accounting
standards
produce
higher
reported
earnings
for
British
companies
.

Under
British
rules
,
Blue
Arrow
was
able
to
write
off
at
once
the
$
1.15
billion
in
good
will
arising
from
the
purchase
.

As
a
U.S.-based
company
,
Blue
Arrow
would
have
to
amortize
the
good
will
over
as
many
as
40
years
,
creating
a
continuing
drag
on
reported
earnings
.

Good
will
is
the
excess
of
cost
of
an
acquired
firm
,
operating
unit
or
assets
over
the
current
or
fair
market
value
of
those
assets
.

But
with
so
many
shares
now
held
in
the
U.S.
,
Blue
Arrow
reports
its
earnings
two
ways
,
based
on
both
U.K.
and
U.S.
accounting
standards
.

``
Our
balance
sheets
look
like
they
came
from
Alice
's
wonderland
,
''
Mr.
Fromstein
said
.

The
British
version
shows
``
a
handful
of
pounds
of
net
worth
''
following
the
1987
write-off
of
good
will
,
while
the
American
version
reflects
``
$
1
billion
of
net
worth
because
almost
none
of
{
the
good
will
}
has
been
written
off
.

''
Mr.
Fromstein
said
he
hopes
to
eradicate
some
of
the
good
will
left
on
Blue
Arrow
's
U.S.
books
in
one
fell
swoop
,
but
would
n't
specify
how
much
.

People
close
to
Blue
Arrow
suggested
the
write-down
would
represent
a
sizable
chunk
,
with
executives
claiming
prior
management
overstated
the
extent
of
Manpower
's
good
will
.

That
move
,
along
with
the
return
to
the
Manpower
name
,
could
bolster
the
company
's
prospects
during
possibly
difficult
times
for
temporary
help
.

The
number
of
U.S.
temporary
workers
fell
about
1
%
in
the
12
months
ending
Aug.
31
,
after
sliding
nearly
3.5
%
in
July
,
said
Kidder
Peabody
's
Mr.
Arthur
.

Blue
Arrow
blamed
the
pretax
profit
drop
in
the
quarter
ended
July
31
partly
on
slower
earnings
growth
of
non-Manpower
units
in
Britain
.

Overall
,
pretax
profit
slid
to
#
18.49
million
in
the
quarter
from
#
18.98
million
a
year
earlier
.

Richard
G.
Sim
,
the
man
credited
with
transforming
Applied
Power
Inc.
from
an
underachiever
into
a
feisty
player
in
the
global
market
for
hydraulic
tools
,
hopes
to
guide
a
similar
turnaround
at
the
company
's
latest
acquisition
,
Barry
Wright
Corp
.

The
45-year-old
former
General
Electric
Co.
executive
figures
it
will
be
easier
this
time
.

But
analysts
,
while
applauding
the
acquisition
,
say
Applied
's
chief
executive
faces
a
tough
challenge
in
integrating
the
two
companies
.

Barry
Wright
,
acquired
by
Applied
for
$
147
million
,
makes
computer-room
equipment
and
vibration-control
systems
.

The
Watertown
,
Mass.
,
company
's
sales
have
been
dormant
and
its
profits
have
dropped
.

Last
year
's
earnings
of
$
1.3
million
,
including
$
815,000
from
a
restructuring
gain
,
were
far
below
the
year-earlier
$
8.4
million
.

Besides
spurring
Barry
Wright
's
sales
,
which
were
$
201.7
million
in
1988
,
Mr.
Sim
must
pare
its
costs
and
product
line
.

``
The
question
is
how
long
it
's
going
to
take
Barry
Wright
to
make
a
contribution
,
''
says
F.
John
Mirek
,
an
analyst
at
Blunt
Ellis
Loewi
in
Milwaukee
.

The
answer
will
help
determine
whether
Applied
continues
to
reach
the
ambitious
goals
set
by
Mr.
Sim
.

The
Butler
,
Wis.
,
manufacturer
went
public
at
$
15.75
a
share
in
August
1987
,
and
Mr.
Sim
's
goal
then
was
a
$
29
per-share
price
by
1992
.

Strong
earnings
growth
helped
achieve
that
price
far
ahead
of
schedule
,
in
August
1988
.

The
stock
has
since
softened
,
trading
around
$
25
a
share
last
week
and
closing
yesterday
at
$
23.00
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

But
Mr.
Sim
has
set
a
fresh
target
of
$
50
a
share
by
the
end
of
Reaching
that
goal
,
says
Robert
T.
Foote
,
Applied
's
chief
financial
officer
,
will
require
``
efficient
reinvestment
''
of
cash
by
Applied
and
continuation
of
its
healthy
19
%
rate
of
return
on
operating
capital
.

In
Barry
Wright
,
Mr.
Sim
sees
a
situation
``
very
similar
''
to
the
one
he
faced
when
he
joined
Applied
as
president
and
chief
operating
officer
in
1985
.

Applied
,
then
a
closely
held
company
,
was
stagnating
under
the
management
of
its
controlling
family
.

While
profitable
,
it
``
was
n't
growing
and
was
n't
providing
a
satisfactory
return
on
invested
capital
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Sim
is
confident
that
the
drive
to
dominate
certain
niche
markets
will
work
at
Barry
Wright
as
it
has
at
Applied
.

He
also
professes
an
``
evangelical
''
fervor
to
develop
a
corporate
culture
that
rewards
managers
who
produce
and
where
decision-making
is
shared
.

Mr.
Sim
considers
the
new
unit
's
operations
``
fundamentally
sound
''
and
adds
that
Barry
Wright
has
been
fairly
successful
in
moving
into
markets
that
have
n't
interested
larger
competitors
.

``
With
a
little
patience
,
these
businesses
will
perform
very
satisfactorily
,
''
Mr.
Sim
says
.

Within
about
six
months
,
``
things
will
be
moving
in
the
right
direction
,
''
he
predicts
.

Mr.
Sim
figures
it
will
be
easier
to
turn
Barry
Wright
around
since
he
's
now
in
the
driver
's
seat
.

When
he
came
to
Applied
,
``
I
did
n't
have
the
power
to
execute
as
I
do
today
,
''
he
says
.

He
was
named
chief
executive
officer
of
Applied
in
1986
and
became
chairman
last
November
.

At
Applied
,
Mr.
Sim
set
growth
as
his
first
objective
.

He
took
the
company
public
in
an
offering
that
netted
Applied
about
$
12.6
million
,
which
helped
launch
the
company
's
acquisition
program
.

Sales
climbed
to
an
estimated
$
245
million
in
fiscal
1989
,
ended
Aug.
31
,
from
$
99.9
million
in
fiscal
1985
.

The
company
expects
that
earnings
,
which
have
marched
steadily
upward
in
recent
years
,
reached
about
$
20.8
million
,
or
$
1.58
a
share
,
in
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
,
up
from
$
15.2
million
in
fiscal
1988
and
$
3.9
million
in
1985
.

The
Supreme
Court
agreed
to
decide
whether
a
federal
court
,
in
an
antitrust
lawsuit
filed
by
state
officials
or
private
parties
,
may
dismantle
a
merger
that
it
has
ruled
anti-competitive
.

The
high
court
agreed
to
hear
the
state
of
California
's
challenge
to
the
legality
of
the
acquisition
of
Lucky
Stores
Inc.
,
a
supermarket
chain
,
by
American
Stores
Co.
which
owns
another
chain
,
Alpha
Beta
Stores
Inc
.

Under
federal
antitrust
law
,
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
and
the
Justice
Department
have
the
authority
to
ask
a
federal
court
to
order
the
divestiture
of
a
merger
that
has
been
completed
but
has
been
found
to
be
anticompetitive
.

But
even
after
the
federal
agencies
have
approved
a
merger
,
federal
antitrust
law
allows
states
or
other
affected
parties
to
sue
to
challenge
the
merger
on
the
grounds
that
it
is
anticompetitive
.

Federal
appeals
courts
,
however
,
disagree
whether
federal
courts
have
the
authority
to
order
the
break
up
of
completed
mergers
in
such
private
antitrust
lawsuits
.

While
the
high
court
tries
to
resolve
the
disparate
views
of
the
appeals
courts
,
American
Stores
remains
under
a
temporary
order
to
operate
the
two
supermarket
chains
as
separate
businesses
.

American
Stores
'
bid
for
Lucky
Stores
began
as
a
hostile
offer
.

But
when
the
tender
offer
was
increased
,
Lucky
's
directors
approved
the
merger
and
,
in
June
1988
,
American
Stores
'
$
2.5
billion
purchase
of
Lucky
Stores
was
completed
.

The
FTC
reviewed
the
merger
and
,
in
August
1988
,
approved
a
settlement
between
the
FTC
staff
and
American
Stores
.

While
the
settlement
was
under
review
by
the
FTC
,
the
staff
required
American
Stores
to
run
the
Lucky
and
Alpha
Beta
chains
separately
.

Meanwhile
,
California
officials
,
arguing
that
the
merger
would
cost
the
state
's
consumers
$
400
million
annually
in
higher
prices
,
sued
in
federal
court
in
September
1988
.

A
federal
judge
in
Los
Angeles
,
after
a
hearing
but
before
a
trial
was
held
,
reached
an
initial
conclusion
that
the
merger
was
anti-competitive
.

He
then
issued
a
preliminary
injunction
ordering
American
Stores
to
continue
to
run
the
two
chains
separately
.

A
federal
appeals
court
in
San
Francisco
ruled
in
March
that
the
district
court
's
order
had
the
same
effect
as
requiring
divestiture
of
one
chain
by
American
Stores
.

The
appeals
court
said
federal
courts
lack
the
authority
to
require
divestiture
in
private
antitrust
lawsuits
.

In
August
,
Supreme
Court
Justice
Sandra
O'Connor
issued
a
temporary
stay
,
requiring
the
separate
operations
to
continue
until
the
high
court
could
decide
whether
to
hear
the
case
.

Right-to-Die
Appeal
The
Bush
administration
,
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
,
said
that
the
Constitution
gives
states
broad
flexibility
to
require
that
medical
patients
in
permanent
,
vegetative
conditions
continue
to
receive
artificial
feeding
and
fluids
.

The
brief
,
filed
by
Solicitor
General
Kenneth
Starr
,
said
the
family
of
a
Missouri
woman
in
such
a
vegetative
state
does
n't
have
the
constitutional
right
to
insist
the
state
cut
off
artificial
feeding
.

The
brief
makes
roughly
the
same
argument
the
government
made
last
week
in
a
brief
urging
more
leeway
for
states
to
restrict
abortions
.

The
brief
filed
yesterday
says
state
regulations
need
only
be
``
reasonable
''
to
withstand
federal
court
review
,
an
easy
standard
for
states
to
satisfy
.

Moreover
,
the
brief
is
critical
of
arguments
for
a
constitutional
right
to
privacy
,
saying
any
right
for
competent
individuals
to
refuse
medical
treatment
should
be
rooted
in
tradition
and
based
on
the
14th
Amendment
``
due
process
''
protection
of
``
liberty
,
''
not
on
``
abstract
notions
''
of
privacy
,
which
the
Constitution
does
n't
mention
.

Abortion
Case
Organizations
supporting
the
constitutional
right
to
abortion
filed
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
in
two
Supreme
Court
cases
in
behalf
of
an
unprecedented
number
of
groups
.

The
brief
,
coordinated
by
the
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
and
Planned
Parenthood
Federation
of
America
,
was
filed
in
behalf
of
274
groups
,
although
many
of
them
were
small
community
religious
organizations
rather
than
national
in
membership
.

The
brief
argued
that
the
1973
decision
recognizing
the
right
to
abortion
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
was
correct
and
should
n't
be
reconsidered
.

After
a
long
day
tending
the
searing
,
blackened
furnaces
of
the
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
Co.
,
Li
Wankui
would
like
to
relax
away
from
the
factory
.

But
in
these
parts
,
the
factory
is
everywhere
.

It
is
employer
,
political
czar
and
dance-committee
chairman
.

Inside
the
sprawling
compounds
that
house
55,000
workers
and
their
families
,
the
factory
operates
the
schools
,
restaurants
,
hospital
and
activities
center
.

The
factory
sells
Mr.
Li
his
food
and
furniture
and
publishes
his
newspaper
.

It
even
restricts
him
and
his
wife
to
one
child
.

Sitting
at
home
with
his
family
around
the
dining
table
,
Mr.
Li
turns
on
the
evening
news
.

``
This
is
the
Panzhihua
Factory
broadcasting
station
,
''
a
perky
anchorwoman
says
.

``
And
here
's
what
happened
today
at
our
factory
.

''
Panzhihua
is
the
ultimate
company
town
.

Nestled
in
the
remote
mountains
of
southern
Sichuan
province
about
1,200
miles
southwest
of
Beijing
,
it
is
virtually
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
China
.

With
few
businesses
nearby
,
it
's
up
to
factory
leaders
to
build
high-rise
housing
and
organize
sports
meets
.

They
truck
in
fresh
fish
from
the
east
coast
and
import
television
sets
from
Japan
.

``
A
Chinese
factory
director
could
be
a
mayor
in
the
U.S.
,
''
says
Mr.
Li
.

``
But
I
do
n't
think
an
American
mayor
could
handle
a
Chinese
factory
.

''
Despite
a
decade-long
attempt
to
revamp
the
socialist
economy
,
China
's
mega-welfare
state
is
alive
and
well
.

Health
care
is
free
,
housing
costs
just
pennies
and
food
is
heavily
subsidized
.

At
Panzhihua
,
as
in
other
big
state-run
factories
,
workers
still
can
count
on
a
cradle-to-grave
safety
net
.

Factory
officials
estimate
that
more
than
10
%
of
the
work
force
here
is
redundant
,
but
layoffs
are
n't
allowed
.

Even
factory
workers
'
children
are
guaranteed
jobs
.

The
industrial
monoliths
are
so
deeply
involved
in
the
welfare
system
that
China
's
leaders
may
never
be
able
to
modernize
them
,
despite
their
glaring
economic
inefficiency
.

Though
the
Panzhihua
factory
itself
is
profitable
,
many
such
enterprises
are
n't
.

Subsidies
for
money-losing
enterprises
totaled
$
18
billion
last
year
,
or
about
one-third
the
total
state
revenue
.

Life
in
the
Panzhihua
factory
beats
a
regular
rhythm
,
and
fully
absorbs
workers
such
as
Mr.
Li
.

A
muscular
38-year-old
,
he
rises
each
morning
at
6
a.m.
to
prepare
for
his
shift
.

(
He
is
entitled
to
one
day
off
after
each
seven
days
of
work
.

)
Throwing
on
sweat
pants
and
a
T-shirt
,
he
pops
downstairs
to
a
food
shop
,
one
of
dozens
run
by
the
factory
in
Panzhihua
's
residential
area
.

Mr.
Li
,
whose
pay
is
the
equivalent
of
about
$
80
a
month
,
buys
steamed
buns
and
rice
porridge
for
his
family
.

Breakfast
for
three
costs
a
quarter
.

After
eating
,
he
heads
to
the
factory
.

Panzhihua
provides
free
bus
service
,
but
he
prefers
the
20-minute
walk
.

At
the
gate
of
the
factory
,
a
huge
sign
greets
Mr.
Li
and
his
co-workers
:
``
Happily
,
happily
come
to
work
!
''
Donning
denims
and
a
hard
hat
,
he
heads
to
the
steel-making
furnace
.

Since
the
temperature
next
to
it
can
reach
540
degrees
Fahrenheit
,
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
provides
workers
as
many
free
orange-flavored
soft
drinks
as
they
want
.

The
factory
produces
the
drinks
in-house
.

At
lunchtime
,
Mr.
Li
walks
to
one
of
the
59
cafeterias
the
factory
operates
.

It
's
a
chaotic
scene
.

Scraps
of
meat
and
bones
litter
the
bare
concrete
floor
.

A
slop-bucket
at
the
doorway
is
filled
with
a
liquid
turned
blood-red
from
Sichuan
peppers
and
hot
sauce
.

The
place
does
n't
look
like
much
,
but
the
food
is
good
,
and
cheap
.

For
about
30
cents
,
Mr.
Li
buys
a
bowl
of
pork
,
vegetables
and
rice
.

At
the
end
of
Mr.
Li
's
workday
,
as
a
new
shift
prepares
to
take
over
,
the
factory
's
propaganda
officials
go
to
work
.

For
half
an
hour
they
relate
to
groups
of
workers
the
latest
news
and
views
from
the
Communist
Party
.

They
read
speeches
from
top
leaders
and
slam
U.S.
sanctions
on
China
imposed
after
the
June
4
massacre
of
pro-democracy
protesters
in
Beijing
.

``
We
want
to
make
sure
that
workers
have
a
correct
opinion
about
events
,
''
says
Yuan
Changyong
,
the
local
Party
chief
.

The
propagandists
also
do
their
part
in
the
national
effort
to
limit
births
.

Teams
of
officials
track
the
contraceptive
methods
their
workers
employ
and
even
chart
menstrual
cycles
of
female
employees
.

They
work
by
persuasion
and
coercion
,
alternating
doses
of
propaganda
with
threats
of
financial
penalties
for
``
unplanned
''
second
births
.

Zhang
Shanyun
,
one
of
Mr.
Li
's
bosses
,
knows
the
system
well
.

Like
many
married
workers
,
Mr.
Zhang
lives
alone
at
the
factory
.

His
wife
remains
in
the
countryside
,
tending
the
farm
land
they
possess
.

Whenever
Mr.
Zhang
wants
to
return
to
his
farm
,
he
must
fill
out
a
form
detailing
what
kind
of
birth-control
device
he
and
his
wife
will
use
.

The
document
must
be
certified
by
factory
officials
and
shown
to
leaders
in
his
wife
's
village
.

``
No
document
,
no
visit
,
''
smiles
Li
Jihong
,
who
heads
birth-control
efforts
at
the
factory
.

Mr.
Li
,
however
,
is
able
to
live
with
his
wife
full-time
.

When
he
returns
home
,
he
ties
on
an
apron
and
begins
to
prepare
dinner
for
his
family
.

Most
of
the
food
comes
to
him
via
the
factory
,
which
buys
80
million
tons
of
produce
a
year
.

The
factory
sells
to
workers
at
cost
,
which
means
prices
are
about
50
%
below
what
the
handful
of
independent
local
merchants
charge
.

For
big
occasions
,
the
factory
brings
in
special
treats
.

Earlier
this
year
,
officials
shipped
in
fresh
crabs
from
Guangdong
province
.

It
turned
out
that
few
workers
here
in
the
hills
of
Sichuan
had
ever
seen
them
,
so
the
factory
TV
station
ran
a
broadcast
on
the
correct
way
to
eat
Guangdong
crabs
.

The
Li
family
home
is
a
simple
,
two-room
apartment
with
bare
concrete
floors
and
whitewashed
walls
.

The
basic
furniture
is
provided
by
the
factory
,
for
five
cents
a
month
.

Most
workers
get
a
bed
,
desk
and
bureau
.

Engineers
also
get
a
bookcase
.

Mr.
Li
's
wife
,
Xia
Huaqiong
,
also
works
at
the
factory
,
tending
the
water
meters
during
the
graveyard
shift
.

There
are
few
prospects
for
upward
mobility
,
and
Mr.
Li
's
daughter
,
seven-year-old
Li
Shu
,
is
certain
to
toil
at
the
factory
too
someday
,
as
are
more
than
10,000
of
the
workers
'
children
.

Li
Shu
is
in
the
second
grade
at
the
Xiangyang
Village
Elementary
School
for
Workers
'
Children
,
one
of
31
schools
subsidized
by
the
factory
at
a
cost
of
more
than
half
a
million
dollars
a
year
.

Her
tuition
is
about
$
1
a
semester
.

Mr.
Li
says
he
is
content
living
in
this
one-company
town
.

But
he
concedes
that
the
pressures
of
the
all-powerful
factory
sometimes
are
tough
to
bear
.

He
could
do
with
more
excitement
,
he
says
.

Most
evenings
after
the
news
,
he
leaves
his
wife
in
front
of
the
TV
set
and
wanders
restlessly
around
his
quiet
neighborhood
.

He
pauses
frequently
to
greet
familiar
faces
:
co-workers
from
the
factory
.

Inevitably
,
he
is
drawn
to
the
Cultural
Center
,
a
drab
,
five-story
structure
with
meeting
rooms
,
stores
,
coffee
shops
,
a
large
swimming
pool
and
a
dance
hall
.

The
center
,
built
and
run
by
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
,
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
social
life
in
this
town
.

Mr.
Li
walks
upstairs
to
the
center
's
second-floor
library
,
a
poorly
lit
room
where
he
spends
many
hours
leafing
through
a
thin
selection
of
state-controlled
periodicals
.

He
pulls
out
a
newspaper
:
The
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
Co
.

Daily
.

``
It
's
a
good
read
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
.

``
Quite
informative
.

''
Today
's
lead
story
:
``
Manager
Zhao
Inspects
Operation
of
No.
4
Furnace
.

''
Not
surprisingly
in
this
remote
outpost
,
many
of
the
single
factory
workers
here
fall
in
love
with
each
other
.

``
We
have
a
very
small
social
circle
,
''
says
Ma
Yongjian
,
the
company
secretary
general
.

``
A
lot
of
the
young
workers
end
up
getting
married
.

''
To
facilitate
such
productive
arrangements
,
the
factory
organizes
dances
each
night
,
often
outdoors
on
a
concrete
promenade
along
the
banks
of
the
Jinshajiang
River
.

On
this
evening
,
the
dancers
seem
reluctant
,
as
a
sour
eight-piece
band
plods
through
a
series
of
Chinese
pop
songs
.

But
things
come
to
life
when
a
slender
woman
in
a
slinky
black
dress
takes
the
microphone
.

The
band
starts
in
,
and
she
begins
to
sing
``
Happy
birthday
to
you
,
''
even
though
it
is
n't
anyone
's
birthday
.

Immediately
,
hundreds
of
couples
leap
to
their
feet
and
rush
onto
the
floor
,
dancing
their
well-rehearsed
three-step
,
cheek-to-cheek
.

Happy
Birthday
,
apparently
a
big
hit
in
Panzhihua
,
lasts
for
10
glorious
minutes
.

As
the
band
plays
,
and
with
romance
in
the
air
,
Mr.
Li
recalls
how
he
came
to
Panzhihua
.

The
factory
,
one
of
Chairman
Mao
's
oddest
follies
,
dates
to
1965
.

Mao
was
sure
that
the
U.S.
,
or
perhaps
the
Soviet
Union
,
was
planning
to
attack
China
's
coast
,
so
he
decided
to
set
up
vital
industries
deep
in
the
remote
interior
.

Like
tens
of
thousands
of
others
,
Mr.
Li
was
ordered
to
go
to
Panzhihua
,
in
1971
.

``
I
lived
in
a
straw-and-mud
house
at
the
time
,
''
he
says
.

``
But
I
was
happy
to
be
here
,
to
carry
on
the
fight
against
the
imperialists
and
the
revisionists
.

''
Today
the
perceived
threat
has
passed
,
but
the
factory
is
thriving
.

What
keeps
Mr.
Li
in
Panzhihua
?
Partly
the
system
.

While
workers
ca
n't
easily
be
fired
,
they
also
ca
n't
easily
quit
to
find
jobs
elsewhere
.

The
Li
family
could
apply
for
permission
to
do
so
,
but
has
n't
tried
.

``
I
expect
I
'll
be
in
Panzhihua
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
.

``
The
No.
1
high
school
is
pretty
good
,
and
I
have
to
think
of
my
daughter
's
future
.

''
Others
have
fled
the
remote
factory
.

Beginning
in
1979
,
it
offered
its
original
settlers
a
chance
to
leave
.

Many
had
been
forced
to
come
,
often
leaving
their
families
and
possessions
behind
.

When
the
opportunity
finally
arose
,
thousands
of
workers
departed
,
including
virtually
all
of
the
factory
's
college
graduates
and
senior
engineers
.

Ma
Zhijie
,
deputy
general
manager
of
the
factory
's
trading
department
,
wants
his
eight-year-old
son
to
have
broader
horizons
,
and
believes
education
is
the
best
ticket
out
of
Panzhihua
.

He
is
pushing
his
child
to
excel
in
school
and
teaches
him
English
at
home
.

``
I
dream
that
my
son
will
attend
college
and
find
a
good
job
somewhere
else
,
''
Mr.
Ma
says
.

Panzhihua
's
isolation
is
immediately
apparent
.

The
area
was
off
limits
to
foreign
visitors
and
reporters
until
1987
,
and
remains
effectively
sealed
off
from
contact
with
the
outside
.

What
the
factory
's
workers
know
of
the
world
comes
filtered
through
the
propaganda
machine
of
official
newspapers
and
television
,
as
well
as
political
study
sessions
.

Workers
have
a
very
sketchy
knowledge
,
for
example
,
about
the
pro-democracy
movement
,
and
its
bloody
suppression
,
in
Beijing
this
spring
.

At
one
point
,
Mr.
Li
repeats
the
theme
of
a
recent
political
study
class
and
harangues
his
American
visitor
about
U.S.
sanctions
against
China
.

``
The
Chinese
and
American
people
have
great
warmth
for
each
other
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
,
``
but
I
must
tell
you
frankly
that
I
disagree
with
President
Bush
's
policy
toward
China
.

''
His
visitor
explains
that
,
to
many
in
the
U.S.
,
the
sanctions
were
considered
too
moderate
.

Many
of
these
Americans
were
incensed
by
the
killings
in
Beijing
and
denounced
the
Chinese
government
.

``
Well
,
I
certainly
did
n't
know
any
of
that
,
''
Mr.
Li
says
,
and
abruptly
closes
the
conversation
.

As
Mr.
Li
begins
his
walk
back
home
,
he
displays
a
slight
limp
,
the
result
of
a
back
injury
.

Last
year
,
the
factory
sent
him
to
northeast
China
to
recuperate
for
six
months
,
all
expenses
paid
.

The
factory
provides
free
medical
care
to
all
workers
and
their
families
.

It
runs
a
modern
,
500-bed
hospital
and
eight
clinics
,
supported
by
$
2.5
million
a
year
in
subsidies
.

When
Mr.
Li
dies
,
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel
will
pay
for
his
cremation
.

And
the
next
generation
will
carry
on
.

At
the
hospital
,
Zhong
Desheng
,
the
director
,
dons
a
doctor
's
smock
and
leads
a
visitor
into
the
maternity
ward
.

A
factory
worker
who
has
just
given
birth
to
a
baby
girl
lies
on
a
bed
,
looking
bewildered
.

Her
baby
has
been
snatched
up
by
the
nurses
and
placed
alongside
nine
others
,
each
tied
up
in
a
tight
cotton
bundle
.

Mr.
Zhong
motions
to
the
wriggling
bundles
.

``
These
,
''
he
says
,
``
are
the
future
workers
of
Panzhihua
Iron
&
Steel

Four
of
Britain
's
biggest
banks
said
they
plan
to
sell
jointly
owned
Yorkshire
Bank
Group
in
an
auction
that
could
raise
between
#
850
million
(
$
1.33
billion
)
and
#
1
billion
(
$
1.57
billion
)
.

National
Westminster
Bank
PLC
,
Yorkshire
Bank
's
biggest
holder
with
a
40
%
stake
,
said
it
,
Barclays
PLC
,
Lloyds
Bank
PLC
and
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
Group
PLC
decided
to
sell
the
250-branch
U.K.
bank
after
receiving
``
a
number
of
approaches
''
from
potential
purchasers
.

They
declined
to
identify
possible
bidders
.

At
a
news
conference
here
yesterday
,
NatWest
officials
said
they
expect
potential
interest
from
banks
throughout
continental
Europe
,
Australia
and
the
U.S
.

Yorkshire

,
which
had
pretax
profit
of

100.4
million
and
#
3.19
billion
in
assets
last
year
,
has
Britain
's
ninth-largest
branch
network
.

It
is
viewed
by
market
analysts
as
a
potential
target
for
banks
aiming
to
boost
their
U.K.
presence
prior
to
the
1992
development
of
a
single
market
in

Analysts
have
said
the
bank
could
fetch
a
price
of
between
8.5
and
10
times
pretax
profit
--
or
between
#
850
million
and
#
1
billion
.

Bill
Barron
,
a
NatWest
general
manager
,
said
the
banks
decided
to
push
ahead
with
the
sale
despite
yesterday
's
sharp
stock-market
fall
in
London
because
the
decision
was
strategic
and
independent
of
market
valuations
.

The
consortium-ownership
arrangement
,
which
dates
from
a
financial
reconstruction
of
Yorkshire
Bank
in
1911
,
is
outmoded
for
the
increasingly
competitive
U.K.
market
,
analysts
say
.

Barclays
owns
32
%
,
Lloyds
owns
20
%
and
Royal
Bank
of
Scotland
owns
8
%
of
Yorkshire
Bank
.

The
Federal
Reserve
gave
comfort
to
the
financial
markets
yesterday
by
allowing
a
key
interest
rate
to
drift
downward
.

In
addition
,
Fed
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
attempted
to
calm
the
markets
by
denying
reports
he
was
publicly
feuding
with
the
Treasury
.

The
Fed
allowed
the
key
federal
funds
interest
rate
to
dip
to
about
8
%
from
its
levels
of
just
below
9
%
last
week
.

That
was
a
sign
to
financial
markets
that
,
at
least
for
now
,
the
Fed
was
easing
its
grip
on
credit
.

Because
the
markets
remained
relatively
calm
,
however
,
the
Fed
did
n't
have
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
October
1987
.

The
fed
funds
rate
is
the
rate
banks
charge
on
loans
to
each
other
.

The
Federal
Reserve
can
heavily
influence
that
rate
by
buying
and
selling
securities
to
financial
institutions
.

``
I
view
this
morning
's
action
as
hand
holding
for
the
financial
markets
,
''
said
Steven
Wood
,
an
economist
with
Bank
of
America
.

He
said
the
Fed
showed
it
was
willing
to
provide
more
money
to
the
financial
system
,
but
it
was
n't
clear
``
how
much
or
for
how
long
.

''
Mr.
Greenspan
appeared
in
public
briefly
yesterday
morning
to
deliver
a
speech
to
the
American
Bankers
Association
convention
here
.

In
a
brief
comment
before
the
speech
,
he
said
he
was
``
surprised
''
that
some
people
interpreted
his
recent
comments
in
Moscow
``
as
endeavoring
to
say
something
about
current
monetary
or
foreign
exchange
policies
.

''
While
visiting
Moscow
last
week
,
the
Fed
chairman
had
warned
that
``
attempts
to
maintain
unrealistic
exchange
rates
''
may
be
destabilizing
--
a
comment
some
interpreted
as
criticism
of
the
Treasury
's
efforts
to
push
down
the
dollar
.

``
I
hope
my
colleagues
at
the
Gosbank
{
the
Soviet
central
bank
}
do
n't
misinterpret
anything
I
said
today
,
''
the
Fed
chairman
joked
before
beginning
the
prepared
text
of
his
speech
.

Mr.
Greenspan
also
tried
to
reassure
the
markets
by
saying
that
``
we
at
the
Federal
Reserve
are
watching
the
financial
markets
rather
closely
.

''
He
said
the
Fed
was
coordinating
its
activities
with
foreign
officials
,
and
that
``
coordination
exists
at
a
detailed
level
here
in
the
U.S.
among
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
SEC
,
the
CFTC
and
the
Treasury
.

''
The
Fed
's
move
to
ease
credit
was
n't
an
aggressive
one
,
but
it
did
signal
a
clear
change
of
policy
from
before
the
stock
market
's
swoon
.

Government
officials
say
it
's
unclear
,
however
,
where
the
bellwether
fed
funds
rate
,
which
influences
other
interest
rates
,
will
come
to
rest
.

If
the
financial
markets
continue
to
show
nervousness
,
the
Fed
may
keep
it
close
to
8
%
.

If
problems
quickly
disappear
,
the
Fed
may
nudge
the
rate
up
to
8
.

Bush
administration
officials
were
pleased
with
the
Fed
's
action
,
and
shared
Mr.
Greenspan
's
view
that
there
was
close
coordination
among
the
various
government
agencies
.

On
Sunday
,
for
instance
,
Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
held
a
lengthy
meeting
with
Mr.
Greenspan
and
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
to
evaluate
information
on
Friday
's
market
plunge
.

At
that
time
,
they
concluded
that
the
drop
was
concentrated
among
takeover
stocks
,
and
that
there
were
no
fundamental
reasons
it
should
turn
into
a
rout
Monday
morning
.

The
administration
also
benefited
from
the
expertise
of
Treasury
Undersecretary
Robert
Glauber
and
Assistant
Secretary
David
Mullins
,
two
former
Harvard
professors
who
had
headed
up
the
Brady
Commission
's
effort
to
investigate
the
1987
crash
.

The
two
men
studied
the
order
imbalances
in
the
stock
markets
and
the
level
of
stock
index
futures
to
determine
what
might
happen
Monday
morning
.

That
led
administration
officials
to
predict
,
accurately
,
that
on
Monday
the
market
would
have
to
drop
60
to
100
points
before
any
recovery
could
begin
.

Some
analysts
have
said
disagreements
between
the
Treasury
and
the
Fed
added
to
an
environment
that
allowed
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
to
occur
.

For
weeks
prior
to
the
market
's
drop
,
the
Treasury
had
been
urging
the
Fed
to
bring
down
short-term
interest
rates
,
and
the
Fed
had
been
resisting
.

Also
,
Fed
Vice
Chairman
Manuel
Johnson
and
Wayne
Angell
,
another
member
of
the
reserve
board
,
had
objected
,
in
a
vote
made
public
Oct.
6
,
to
the
Treasury
's
efforts
to
push
down
the
dollar
by
selling
currency
in
foreign
exchange
markets
.

Mr.
Greenspan
was
also
known
to
be
privately
unenthusiastic
about
the
Treasury
's
orders
for
massive
dollar
sales
.

His
comments
in
Moscow
last
week
were
interpreted
by
some
as
a
subtle
attempt
to
make
those
concerns
public
.

Separately
,
David
Ruder
,
who
left
the
chairmanship
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
two
weeks
ago
,
says
investors
should
view
market
volatility
as
a
fact
of
modern
market
life
.

``
I
do
not
regard
the
amount
of
the
decline
on
Friday
as
unexpected
or
unlikely
,
''
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

``
With
the
market
being
up
to
2,700
or
2,800
and
the
existence
of
derivative
products
...
one
can
expect
volatility
of
the
magnitude
we
had
.

''
But
he
asked
that
institutional
investors
take
a
socially
responsible
role
in
supporting
the
market
.

``
Institutional
investors
bear
a
responsibility
to
not
only
not
sell
but
to
step
up
and
buy
without
waiting
for
the
market
to
bottom
,
''
Mr.
Ruder
said
.

Mr.
Ruder
,
now
a
professor
at
the
Northwestern
University
School
of
Law
in
Chicago
,
also
expressed
concern
about
two
pauses
in
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
futures
pits
after
prices
had
fallen
and
circuit
breakers
kicked
in
.

Noting
that
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
continued
to
fall
as
the
futures
were
spared
further
carnage
,
Mr.
Ruder
said
,
``
I
think
that
's
something
that
needs
to
be
looked
at
very
carefully
.

Congressman
Lee
Hamilton
,
an
Indiana
Democrat
who
chairs
the
the
Joint
Economic
Committee
,
plans
hearings
next
week
on
his
bill
to
subject
the
Fed
to
greater
political
control
.

The
Fed
already
is
experiencing
political
pressure
to
supply
lower
interest
rates
and
easy
money
.

Former
Senator
William
Proxmire
has
called
the
Hamilton
bill
the
most
dangerous
economic
legislation
now
before
Congress
,
because
it
would
give
U.S.
economic
policy
a
further
inflationary
bias
.

It
is
n't
given
much
chance
of
passing
,
but
its
mere
existence
is
cause
for
anxiety
.

The
U.S.
and
the
world
are
not
in
need
of
new
doubts
about
the
future
soundness
of
the
dollar
.

Attempts
in
late
September
to
drive
the
dollar
down
through
central
bank
interventions
were
ill-timed
,
particularly
since
we
now
know
that
the
dollar
was
then
in
the
process
of
taking
another
dive
relative
to
oil
and
other
producer
goods
.

The
sharp
rise
in
the
September
Producer-Price
Index
announced
Friday
fueled
the
stock
market
debacle
.

The
Hamilton
bill
would
put
the
Treasury
Secretary
on
the
Fed
's
board
and
Open
Market
Committee
,
which
charts
monetary
policy
.

More
worrisome
,
Congress
would
have
a
stronger
supervisory
role
,
with
the
Fed
audited
by
the
General
Accounting
Office
,
which
Congress
runs
.

Those
sound
like
innocuous
changes
,
but
they
're
not
.

Both
the
Treasury
and
Congress
traditionally
have
pushed
for
easy
money
,
the
Treasury
to
reduce
its
debt
management
problems
and
Congress
to
satisfy
powerful
producer
constituencies
who
want
a
weak
dollar
for
short-term
competitive
gains
in
world
markets
.

Congressional
pressures
on
the
Fed
similar
to
those
that
produced
the
savings
and
loan
mess
are
an
awful
thought
.

Even
now
,
the
Fed
can
not
simply
thumb
its
nose
at
the
President
and
Congress
.

But
it
can
resist
.

Paul
Volcker
found
subtle
ways
to
take
his
case
to
the
people
,
with
good
results
.

Easy
money
advocates
,
however
,
are
adept
at
spreading
economic
myths
.

There
is
the
constant
insistence
that
the
Fed
could
lower
interest
rates
were
it
not
so
obstinate
.

The
Fed
indeed
can
lower
short-term
interest
rates
by
pumping
reserves
into
the
banks
,
but
it
ca
n't
do
much
about
them
from
there
on
.

If
the
reserves
generate
inflation
,
which
is
what
the
Fed
fears
most
right
now
,
interest
rates
will
go
up
as
lenders
demand
a
premium
.

Enough
inflation
can
ultimately
even
wipe
out
the
bond
market
,
as
it
did
in
Britain
in
the
1970s
,
thereby
crippling
the
economy
.

The
other
myth
is
that
inflation
generates
economic
growth
.

It
may
do
that
temporarily
but
it
also
sows
the
seeds
for
stagnation
.

These
two
myths
have
caused
the
republic
untold
damage
.

The
U.S.
economy
took
on
an
inflationary
bias
when
the
Fed
was
forced
to
finance
an
incredible
spending
spree
by
Lyndon
Johnson
.

Richard
Nixon
exacerbated
the
problem
when
,
in
response
to
pressures
from
Congress
,
he
applied
price
and
wage
controls
in
August
1971
,
thereby
discouraging
production
.

Jimmy
Carter
ultimately
hired
Mr.
Volcker
to
kill
inflation
,
which
was
reaching
dangerous
levels
.

He
did
,
too
late
to
save
Mr.
Carter
from
forced
retirement
.

But
all
that
was
a
long
time
ago
and
politicians
have
a
way
of
forgetting
such
things
.

The
1970s
inflation
yielded
great
benefits
to
some
producer
interests
,
including
Arab
sheiks
,
at
the
expense
of
the
American
middle
class
.

It
was
a
classic
example
of
how
inflation
transfers
income
to
the
wealthy
from
the
middle
class
.

That
explains
why
there
are
always
powerful
political
interests
pushing
for
a
soft
currency
.

In
some
countries
,
Argentina
for
example
,
those
interests
have
overwhelmed
the
government
and
what
remains
of
a
middle
class
.

The
claim
that
inflation
generates
economic
growth
is
seductive
.

In
fact
it
does
the
opposite
.

As
the
charts
show
,
the
1975-80
inflation
destroyed
both
productivity
and
economic
growth
(
see
accompanying
charts
--
WSJ
Oct.
17
,
1989
)
.

It
was
only
after
Mr.
Volcker
killed
inflation
,
at
the
cost
of
a
sharp
but
brief
recession
,
that
growth
and
productivity
started
rising
once
more
.

Producers
were
forced
by
the
discipline
of
sound
money
to
slash
away
organizational
fat
and
acquire
more
efficient
equipment
.

After
having
performed
that
admirable
feat
,
however
,
they
were
back
in
1985
demanding
a
dollar
devaluation
that
would
make
it
still
easier
for
them
to
compete
in
international
markets
.

They
got
the
devaluation
and
,
as
is
usually
the
case
,
began
picking
up
fat
again
.

So
now
they
want
another
one
.

Many
corporate
executives
do
n't
understand
or
do
n't
want
to
understand
that
their
own
companies
eventually
become
victims
of
such
policies
.

Inflation
destroys
capital
investment
.

Corporate
depreciation
reserves
lose
value
relative
to
equipment
replacement
costs
.

Investors
are
reluctant
to
invest
long
term
.

Corporations
,
in
effect
,
decapitalize
themselves
.

That
was
reflected
in
the
stagnant
stock
market
of
the
1970s
.

Strikes
increase
as
workers
demand
raises
to
cope
with
rising
prices
,
make
up
for
what
they
already
have
lost
and
hedge
against
what
they
will
lose
in
the
months
ahead
.

Productivity
falls
,
and
weaker
production
further
fans
inflation
.

The
middle
class
gets
poorer
,
and
the
poor
feel
greater
pain
than
ever
.

All
of
which
explains
why
stock
and
foreign
exchange
markets
get
jittery
when
the
Fed
comes
under
political
pressure
.

Particularly
so
when
it
comes
at
a
time
when
the
Fed
has
done
well
.

When
it
tightened
up
last
spring
,
the
price
indexes
fell
and
the
economy
began
to
pick
up
speed
again
,
which
is
of
course
exactly
counter
to
the
``
inflation-fuels-growth
''
theory
.

But
not
all
the
news
is
bad
.

Rep.
Stephen
Neal
(
D.
,
N.C
.

)
wants
Congress
to
instruct
the
Fed
to
do
one
thing
:
prevent
inflation
.

Nothing
could
be
more
to
the
point
.

LAC
Minerals
Ltd.
said
it
agreed
to
buy
65
%
of
Denver-based
Bond
International
Gold
Inc.
for
$
10
a
share
,
or
$
373.8
million
.

The
stake
in
the
gold-mining
company
is
held
by
companies
controlled
by
Australian
financier
Alan
Bond
,
who
has
been
selling
assets
to
reduce
debt
.

LAC
,
a
gold-mining
company
,
said
the
transaction
is
to
close
Nov.
21
,
subject
to
regulatory
approval
and
other
customary
conditions
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Bond
International
closed
unchanged
at
$
8.75
.

The
purchase
helps
LAC
make
up
for
a
court
decision
earlier
this
year
in
which
it
lost
a
long
legal
battle
with
Toronto-based
Corona
Corp.
for
control
of
Canada
's
richest
gold
mine
.

The
Bond
International
stake
would
roughly
double
LAC
's
gold
production
and
substantially
reduce
its
average
cost
of
producing
gold
.

Bond
International
is
expected
to
produce
about
600,000
ounces
of
gold
in
the
fiscal
year
ending
June
30
,
of
which
roughly
two-thirds
would
be
attributable
to
LAC
from
the
date
the
acquisition
is
completed
.

LAC
itself
is
expected
to
produce
about
400,000
ounces
this
year
.

Last
year
,
Bond
International
spent
an
average
$
204
to
produce
an
ounce
of
gold
at
mines
in
North
and
South
America
and
in
Australia
,
significantly
lower
than
LAC
's
own
average
cost
of
$
260
an
ounce
.

Analysts
say
the
real
jewel
in
the
Bond
International
crown
is
its
83
%
stake
in
Chile
's
El
Indio
mine
,
which
they
say
had
production
costs
of
below
$
100
an
ounce
.

A
LAC
spokesman
said
the
company
has
``
enough
cash
''
to
pay
for
the
Bond
International
stake
without
borrowing
.

The
spokesman
said
LAC
has
no
intentions
``
right
now
''
to
further
increase
its
stake
in
Bond
International
.

Dallas
investor
Harold
Simmons
says
he
has

decided
to

his
Lockheed
Corp.
shares
,
after
all
.

In
a
terse

release
responding

yesterday

,
which
credited
a
front-page
interview
story
in

Los

said
the
quotes
in
the
articles
``
do
not
accurately
reflect
Valhi
's
and
Mr.

's

''
concerning
their
interests
in
Lockheed
.

Through
Valhi
and
its
affiliates
,
Mr.
Simmons
holds
a
10.43
%
stake
in
the
aerospace
and
electronics
concern
,
and
his
plans
concerning
Lockheed
have
been
the
subject
of
much

among
securities
analysts
.

In
the

,
Mr.

was
quoted
as

The

that
Valhi

they
have
said
in
public

,
``

Tokyo
share
prices
dropped
sharply
in
early
Monday
morning
trading
following
Wall
Street
's
plunge
on
Friday
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

At
1:30
p.m
.

Tokyo
time
,
the
Nikkei
index
of
225
selected
stocks
was
off
1.4
%
,
or
482.39
points
,
to
34633.63
.

In
the
first
20
minutes
of
trading
in
the
morning
,
the
Nikkei
index
had
fallen
611.62
points
or
1.7
%
,
as
nervous
investors
sold
large
capital
issues
.

Traders
remained
guarded
.

Yoshiro
Inoue
,
an
analyst
at
Nomura
Securities
Co.
,
described
the
steep
decline
in
the
beginning
as
``
a
New
York
shock
.

''
He
predicted
that
``
there
would
be
no
steep
recovery
but
at
the
same
time
there
would
be
no
further
decline
.

''
Said
a
Japanese
equities
trader
at
Jardine
Flemings
Securities
Ltd.
,
in
Tokyo
:
``
There
is
still
a
lot
of
weakness
and
nervousness
in
the
market
.

''
Last
Friday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plunged
190.58
points
to
close
at
2569.26
,
its
worst
loss
in
points
since
the
October
1987
crash
.

The
announcement
that
a
group
of
takeover
bidders
for
UAL
Corp.
had
failed
to
raise
enough
money
to
acquire
the
U.S.
airline
was
one
of
the
main
factors
that
triggered
the
sell-off
,
analysts
said
.

World
stock
markets
,
bracing
over
the
weekend
for
a
sharp
fall
in
share
prices
Monday
,
were
watching
Tokyo
closely
for
signals
.

How
far
share
prices
fall
in
other
markets
will
depend
to
a
great
extent
on
how
the
Tokyo
market
reacts
,
analysts
and
investors
said
.

``
I
'm
hoping
Japan
holds
tight
,
''
said
Allen
Wheat
,
head
of
trading
at
Bankers
Trust
Co.
in
London
,
before
the
Tokyo
opening
.

``
But
if
Japan
is
wobbly
,
London
will
probably
take
a
beating
.

''
Prior
to
the
Tokyo
opening
,
few
were
expecting
panic
to
set
in
,
mainly
because
today
's
market
conditions
are
different
from
those
that
led
to
the
world-wide
downward
spiral
in
October
1987
.

The
French
market
could
be
harder
hit
than
the
London
market
,
European
analysts
said
,
because
recent
unmaterialized
takeover
speculation
in
Paris
has
left
some
blue-chip
stocks
poised
for
markdowns
.

``
Paris
has
had
an
awful
lot
of
froth
in
the
past
two
weeks
and
so
is
probably
going
to
be
hit
a
bit
worse
than
London
,
''
said
David
Band
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Barclays
Bank
PLC
's
Barclays
de
Zoete
Wedd
investment
banking
unit
.

The
Tokyo
market
's
opening
behavior
seemed
to
be
in
line
with
predictions
that
a
blood
bath
could
be
avoided
.

Analysts
in
Tokyo
had
said
over
the
weekend
that
a
drop
is
unavoidable
,
but
they
predicted
that
Japan
's
traditionally
cautious
institutional
investors
will
keep
things
from
spinning
out
of
control
.

``
The
Tokyo
market
ca
n't
help
but
go
down
,
''
said
Hiroaki
Hanao
,
deputy
general
manager
of
the
equity
department
at
Daiwa
Securities
Co
.

``
But
it
wo
n't
be
such
a
big
crash
.

''
The
Ministry
of
Finance
and
the
Bank
of
Japan
appear
to
be
eager
to
put
out
the
fire
before
it
spreads
.

Japanese
newspapers
reported
Saturday
that
the
Ministry
of
Finance
and
the
Bank
of
Japan
view
the
plunge
on
Wall
Street
as
a
result
of
U.S.
domestic
concerns
about
financing
acquisitions
,
not
as
a
sign
of
weak
economic
fundamentals
.

There
were
also
rumors
that
the
Japanese
financial
authorities
warned
large
brokerage
firms
and
institutional
investors
over
the
weekend
against
taking
any
hasty
actions
Monday
.

How
effective
such
guidance
might
be
remains
to
be
seen
.

One
analyst
said
that
with
all
eyes
on
the
Japanese
market
it
will
be
difficult
this
time
for
the
Finance
Ministry
to
try
anything
that
could
be
seen
as
artificially
propping
up
the
market
.

As
Japanese
investors
prepare
for
some
rough
waters
this
week
,
they
will
be
paying
close
attention
to
the
foreign
exchange
markets
.

``
Tokyo
is
most
worried
about
the
currency
,
''
said
Daiwa
Securities
'
Mr.
Hanao
.

If
the
yen
rebounds
against
the
dollar
,
he
said
,
there
is
less
chance
of
an
additional
increase
in
interest
rates
,
which
could
help
stabilize
Tokyo
share
prices
.

Last
Wednesday
,
the
Bank
of
Japan
raised
the
discount
rate
0.5
percentage
point
to
3.75
%
to
stem
the
dollar
's
rise
.

Of
ficials
said
they
were
concerned
that
a
weaker
yen
will
contribute
to
greater
inflation
in
Japan
.

In
New
York
trading
on
Friday
the
dollar
dropped
1.4
%
to
close
at
142.10
yen
.

Dealers
are
expecting
the
dollar
to
be
skittish
,
as
the
market
waits
for
U.S.
authorities
to
indicate
their
monetary
policy
plans
.

The
dollar
opened
in
Tokyo
at
139.95
,
down
4.05
from
last
Friday
's
Tokyo
finish
.

Despite
currency
market
concerns
,
analysts
stressed
that
Tokyo
market
conditions
today
are
n't
what
they
were
in
1987
.

Then
,
many
market
watchers
in
the
U.S.
worried
that
the
highly
speculative
Tokyo
market
would
be
the
one
to
send
world
markets
reeling
.

Now
,
many
look
to
Tokyo
as
a
potential
stabilizing
factor
because
of
its
resilience
and
quick
recovery
following
Black
Monday
.

Analysts
say
one
point
in
Tokyo
's
favor
this
time
is
the
fact
that
for
the
past
several
weeks
the
market
has
been
in
relatively
low
gear
,
driven
by
fundamental
concerns
about
earnings
and
interest
rates
rather
than
wild
speculation
.

On
Friday
,
the
Nikkei
index
rose
320.97
to
close
at
35116.02
.

Trading
volume
has
also
fallen
off
in
recent
weeks
.

``
A
lot
of
the
speculative
fat
has
been
trimmed
,
''
said
one
analyst
.

Some
analysts
predict
that
Japanese
institutions
may
look
at
this
as
a
good
time
to
hunt
for
bargains
.

Many
Japanese
funds
,
which
closed
their
books
at
the
end
of
September
,
now
have
huge
cash
positions
.

``
There
's
still
lots
of
idle
money
sitting
around
here
,
''
said
Hiroshi
Ohira
,
chief
analyst
at
New
Japan
Securities
Co.
,
citing
a
frequently
stated
reason
for
Tokyo
's
strength
.

Said
another
foreign
stock
analyst
:
``
All
the
Japanese
brokers
will
try
to
look
for
the
positive
aspects
of
this
.

''
Whatever
happens
in
Tokyo
,
the
powerful
ripple
effects
are
sure
to
be
felt
first
in
other
Asian
markets
.

A
severe
drop
in
Japanese
stock
prices
or
a
steep
fall
in
the
dollar
would
exacerbate
price
declines
in
smaller
markets
such
as
Hong
Kong
,
money
managers
say
.

In
Hong
Kong
,
brokers
and
fund
managers
expect
the
widely
watched
Hang
Seng
index
,
which
closed
Friday
at
2782.30
,
to
shed
at
least
100
points
,
or
5
%
.

Some
think
a
sharper
decline
is
possible
.

The
Hang
Seng
index
opened
at
2736
,
down
46.3
points
,
or
1.7
%
.

Investors
have
already
been
treating
the
market
with
some
caution
.

In
late
May
and
early
June
,
when
political
turmoil
overwhelmed
China
,
the
Hang
Seng
index
plummeted
37
%
to
2093
.

(
Hong
Kong
reverts
to
China
in
1997
.

)
Since
then
,
international
fund
managers
decreased
their
exposure
to
the
market
and
only
recently
have
begun
to
tiptoe
back
in
.

``
It
's
not
like
the
crash
in
October
1987
,
when
there
was
lots
of
optimism
,
''
said
Phillip
Niem
,
research
director
in
Hong
Kong
for
British-based
Hoare
Govette
Asia
Ltd
.

``
This
time
around
there
's
lots
of
caution
.

People
are
already
scared
.

Institutions
'
weighting
in
Hong
Kong
are
low
now
anyway
.

''
After
a
108-point
decline
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
on
Friday
,
Oct.
16
,
1987
,
the
Hang
Seng
index
plunged
420.81
points
,
or
11.3
%
,
the
following
Monday
.

Later
that
day
Black
Monday
unfolded
in
New
York
,
and
officials
closed
the
Hong
Kong
exchange
for
four
days
,
a
move
that
shook
investor
confidence
in
the
market
.

This
time
around
,
government
and
market
officials
said
,
the
territory
's
revamped
equity
market
will
remain
open
regardless
of
what
happens
in
New
York
today
.

London
's
stock
market
,
already
wheezing
under
stresses
of
its
own
,
is
also
casting
a
nervous
eye
toward
Tokyo
and
bracing
for
a
shock
.

Many
London
traders
planned
an
allnight
vigil
on
developments
in
the
Tokyo
market
.

``
A
lot
of
our
guys
will
be
sitting
up
all
night
at
home
,
and
a
couple
of
our
guys
will
be
in
the
office
overnight
,
''
said
Mr.
Wheat
of
Bankers
Trust
.

Authorities
,
including
the
Bank
of
England
and
the
Securities
Association
,
are
gearing
up
in
case
a
crisis
wallops
the
London
market
.

The
bank
was
in
touch
with
other
major
central
banks
over
the
weekend
and
was
preparing
to
make
capital
available
to
dealers
if
needed
,
as
it
did
in
the
1987
crash
,
according
to
people
familiar
with
the
bank
's
strategy
.

However
,
in
an
unusual
public
statement
,
the
bank
sought
to
play
down
any
note
of
crisis
.

Said
a
spokesman
:
``
There
's
no
reason
for
such
an
exaggerated
fall
in
London
,
where
share
values
are
n't
underpinned
in
the
same
degree
as
New
York
by
highly
leveraged
situations
.

''
The
Securities
Association
,
which
regulates
London
's
stock
markets
,
said
that
if
prices
plunge
today
all
dealers
will
be
ordered
to
report
their
capital
and
market
positions
daily
.

``
We
're
monitoring
things
very
closely
,
''
a
spokeswoman
said
.

Even
before
Friday
's
New
York
nosedive
,
the
London
market
had
been
facing
heavy
uncertainty
because
of
worries
over
the
British
economy
.

After
the
one-point
rise
Oct.
5
to
15
%
,
Britain
's
base
interest
rate
stands
at
its
highest
level
in
eight
years
.

Many
economists
have
been
predicting
that
the
country
's
economic
growth
will
be
little
more
than
1
%
in
Responding
to
the
developments
,
the
Financial
Times
100-share
index
,
which
had
been
slightly
higher
most
of
the
day
,
closed
at
2233.9
,
down
3.9
points
from
Thursday
.

The
impending
stock
market
troubles
could
pose
a
dilemma
for
already
embattled
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
.

A
market
plunge
in
Britain
could
bring
pressure
for
him
to
lower
interest
rates
.

But
a
rate
cut
could
weaken
the
recently
depressed
pound
,
which
late
Friday
staged
a
sharp
rally
against
the
dollar
after
news
of
the
New
York
market
sell-off
.

One
person
who
firmly
believes
London
is
headed
for
trouble
no
matter
what
happens
elsewhere
is
Peter
Thompson
.

This
widely
followed
stock
market
forecaster
achieved
fame
by
predicting
,
in
July
1987
,
the
October
crash
of
that
year
.

Mr.
Thompson
,
a
consultant
to
Barclay
de
Zoete
Wedd
Securities
Ltd.
,
jolted
the
London
market
last
Monday
by
predicting
that
another
bear
market
is
at
hand
.

``
London
will
open
lower
{
today
}
whether
or
not
Tokyo
opens
lower
,
''
Mr.
Thompson
said
in
an
interview
.

``
Market
makers
will
mark
down
prices
so
bears
ca
n't
go
short
to
them
at
too
advantageous
a
price
.

''
By
going
short
,
a
market
pessimist
sells
borrowed
shares
in
the
hope
of
buying
them
back
later
at
a
profit
.

Any
big
drop
in
London
prices
will
further
cool
the
already
jaded
British
appetite
for
leveraged
buy-outs
,
analysts
said
.

Here
are
price
trends
on
the
world
's
major
stock
markets
,
as
calculated
by

Stanley

.

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling

The
percentage
change
is
since

John
W.

Automotive
and

Dallas
investor
Harold
Simmons
,
who
has
been
gobbling
up
Lockheed

and
only
two
months
ago
told
this
newspaper
that
he
was
in
the
stock
for
the
long

now
insists
he
wants

In

yesterday
with

,
Mr.
Simmons
said
:
``

Mr.
Simmons
,
who
holds

10.43

in
Lockheed

added
that

``
Not
now

not

he
told
the
newspaper
.

``
Actually

I
wish

were
out

to
be
getting
more
uncertain

So
I

Lockheed
's
share
price
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
has
been
propped
up
in
recent
weeks
,
despite
disappointing
earnings
,
because
of
Mr.
Simmons
's
interest
in
the
company
.

In
composite

,
Lockheed
slipped

have
bought
up
880,000
.

``
Does
that
sound
like
a
seller
to
you
?
''
Mr.
Lamb
said
yesterday
.

``
It
just
does
n't
make
any
sense
.

''
Mr.
Simmons
could
n't
be
reached
to
elaborate
,
and
Lockheed
officials
could
n't
be
reached
to
comment
on
the
Daily
News
article
.

But
Mr.
Lamb
said
it
's
Mr.
Simmons
's
style
to
try
and
leave
Wall
Street
befuddled
.

He
said
Mr.
Simmons
knows
the
arbitrage
community
``
can
be
a
detriment
by
driving
the
share
price
up
.

''
Mr.
Lamb
said
if
the
arbitrageurs
get
confused
,
maybe
they
'll
move
out
of
the
stock
and
leave
more
for
Mr.
Simmons
to
grab
.

Vitro
S.A.
said
it
signed
a
definitive
agreement
to
acquire
Anchor
Glass
Container
Corp.
for
$
21.25
a
share
,
or
$
265
million
,
in
the
largest
takeover
of
an
American
company
by
a
Mexican
concern
.

Anchor
was
relatively
unaffected
by
Friday
's
market
plunge
,
perhaps
because
Vitro
was
bidding
for
the
company
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Anchor
closed
at
$
18.375
,
down
$
1.375
.

Yesterday
's
announcement
of
the
accord
culminated
a
two-month
long
battle
for
the
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
maker
of
bottles
and
other
glass
containers
.

Anchor
had
been
fighting
Vitro
's
earlier
$
20-a-share
tender
offer
and
agreed
to
the
sweetened
bid
after
a
special
committee
of
Anchor
's
board
put
the
company
on
the
block
.

Anchor
said
previously
that
it
held
talks
with
other
parties
,
but
no
other
bids
emerged
.

Vitro
,
which
already
owns
1,430,000
Anchor
shares
,
agreed
to
buy
the
remaining
12,470,000
shares
outstanding
through
THR
Corp.
,
an
indirect
subsidiary
of
Vitro
.

The
Monterrey
,
Mexico
,
conglomerate
also
confirmed
a
previous
announcement
that
it
would
acquire
closely
held
Latchford
Glass
Co.
of
Huntington
Park
,
Calif.
,
in
a
separate
transaction
expected
to
close
at
the
same
time
as
the
completion
of
the
Anchor
takeover
.

The
purchase
price
of
the
Latchford
transaction
was
n't
disclosed
.

Vitro
said
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
committed
$
139
million
to
finance
the
purchase
of
Anchor
and
an
affiliate
of
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp.
committed
$
155
million
in
a
bridge
loan
to
finance
the
Anchor
and
Latchford
acquisitions
.

Ernesto
Martens
R.
,
Vitro
's
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
company
intends
to
keep
Anchor
based
in
Tampa
and
that
the
unit
would
be
run
independently
by
U.S.
managers
.

Mr.
Martens
called
the
takeover
a
``
unique
strategic
opportunity
''
for
Vitro
to
become
``
a
world
player
''
in
the
glass-container
industry
.

Among
other
things
,
Vitro
makes
glass
containers
,
flat
glass
and
glass-making
machinery
.

From
the
professional
money
manager
to
the
big
overseas
currency
player
to
the
little
guy
with
his
IRA
in
a
mutual
fund
,
the
bulletin
from
Wall
Street
came
as
a
shock
--
followed
swiftly
by
a
sickening
recollection
of
the
pattern
played
out
in
the
'87
crash
:
a
100-point-plus
plunge
on
a
Friday
,
a
weekend
of
worrying
in
between
,
and
then
disaster
on
Monday
.

Who
could
be
blamed
for
wondering
if
it
is
all
happening
again
,
in
another
nervous
October
?
``
It
's
scaring
the
hell
out
of
me
,
''
says
Tom
Loughlin
,
a
systems
analyst
and
small
investor
in
Boston
.

Friday
's
events
demonstrate
that
despite
all
the
post-1987
studies
and
reforms
,
the
stock
market
can
still
plunge
with
dizzying
steepness
.

The
190.58-point
drop
was
the
second-largest
in
magnitude
ever
,
and
the
12th
worst
on
a
percentage
basis
.

But
what
was
most
terrifying
was
its
speed
:
The
market
dropped
154
points
in
only
65
minutes
,
pausing
only
as
the
close
neared
.

Moreover
,
this
plunge
came
in
a
time
of
relatively
benign
economic
conditions
,
raising
the
question
of
how
the
markets
might
react
when
a
serious
economic
upset
,
such
as
a
recession
,
is
on
the
horizon
.

But
despite
its
hair-trigger
edginess
,
whether
the
market
today
will
in
fact
mirror
1987
with
a
further
dive
is
a
far
different
matter
.

There
are
many
reasons
to
think
that
what
appeared
Friday
is
another
species
of
bear
,
and
a
less
vicious
one
.

The
reasons
include
the
obvious
differences
in
the
market
between
this
fall
and
1987
:
Interest
rates
have
n't
been
rising
this
time
,
as
they
were
in
1987
;
the
dollar
,
though
hit
Friday
,
has
n't
been
eroding
dangerously
;
the
economy
is
n't
overheating
;
and
,
above
all
,
stocks
are
far
from
being
as
wildly
overpriced
:
They
are
selling
at
only
about
13
times
per-share
earnings
,
compared
with
about
20
two
years
ago
.

And
this
time
,
the
regulators
are
moving
with
more
dispatch
.

The
Federal
Reserve
has
already
indicated
that
it
will
provide
the
credit
needed
to
see
that
there
is
n't
a
liquidity
squeeze
today
.

Many
traders
think
the
Fed
will
quickly
lower
interest
rates
,
a
move
that
would
be
a
plus
for
stocks
.

--
The
levels
of
selling
of
U.S
and
foreign
stocks
in
Asian
and
European
markets
,
which
open
well
before
New
York
's
.

In
early
trading
in
Tokyo
Monday
,
share
prices
fell
1.7
%
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

--
Whether
the
buy-out
of
United
Airlines
parent
UAL
Corp.
,
whose
financing
failure
triggered
Friday
's
free
fall
,
can
be
put
back
together
.

Late
yesterday
,
it
was
n't
clear
the
buyers
could
make
a
new
bid
by
today
.

The
lower
UAL
opens
,
the
more
traders
who
've
bought
with
borrowed
money
will
have
to
sell
UAL
and
other
takeover
stocks
to
meet
margin
calls
.

--
The
levels
of
early
stock-index
futures
trading
in
Chicago
.

That
market
shut
down
early
on
Friday
,
leaving
millions
of
dollars
of
sell
orders
unexecuted
.

Heavy
index-futures
selling
often
pulls
the
stock
market
down
.

--
The
pressures
on
mutual-fund
companies
to
sell
stock
in
order
to
meet
demands
from
customers
for
redemptions
.

On
Black
Monday
,
some
funds
sold
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars
in
stocks
after
being
inundated
with
redemptions
.

But
late
yesterday
,
the
biggest
fund
group
,
Fidelity
Investments
,
said
this
weekend
's
redemptions
were
running
at
under
one-third
the
level
before
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

--
Any
action
by
the
Federal
Reserve
.

Any
move
to
lower
interest
rates
,
for
example
,
would
be
a
positive
for
stocks
,
by
making
fixed-income
investments
less
competitive
with
them
.

Much
as
in
the
1987
crash
,
the
spark
that
lit
the
fuse
on
Friday
was
a
news
announcement
that
,
at
first
blush
,
seemed
to
have
little
bearing
on
the
market
as
a
whole
.

When
the
UAL
buy-out
group
said
it
could
n't
get
bank
financing
for
its
$
6.79
billion
deal
,
the
announcement
sent
takeover-stock
traders
scrambling
to
sell
United
,
other
airline
stocks
and
then
other
real
or
rumored
takeover
stocks
.

The
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
took
only
15
minutes
from
the
UAL
announcement
,
at
2:54
p.m.
,
to
hit
their
first
``
circuit
breaker
,
''
a
30-minute
trading
halt
that
kicks
in
when
the
futures
drop
the
equivalent
of
100
points
on
the
Dow
.

When
the
futures
reopened
at
3:30
,
it
took
only
15
minutes
more
for
them
to
hit
the
next
100-point-equivalency
limit
,
when
S&P
trading
halted
for
the
day
.

At
the
stock
market
's
4
p.m.
close
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
average
was
withing
60
points
of
another
circuit
breaker
.

Had
the
Dow
fallen
250
points
,
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
would
have
been
halted
for
an
hour
.

Many
investors
say
the
circuit
breakers
,
instituted
following
the
1987
collapse
,
provided
little
reassurance
.

One
Big
Board
specialist
complains
that
the
Friday
futures
halt
,
which
was
supposed
to
give
the
markets
time
to
regain
their
equilibrium
because
futures
prices
are
reported
faster
,
was
``
ridiculous
;
anything
artificial
that
gets
in
the
way
of
this
market
is
very
hard
to
work
with
.

''
Some
traders
fear
circuit
breakers
hold
the
risk
of
making
matters
worse
,
especially
if
they
should
halt
stock
trading
.

But
Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
maintains
that
the
safeguards
were
a
success
Friday
.

There
were
also
complaints
that
the
specialists
on
the
floor
of
the
Big
Board
,
who
are
charged
with
making
markets
in
individual
stocks
,
performed
poorly
during
the
plunge
.

Trading
was
halted
in
10
stocks
when
specialists
could
n't
balance
buy
and
sell
orders
in
some
stocks
,
such
as
entertainment
giant
Walt
Disney
Co
.

Seven
never
reopened
.

One
futures
executive
,
Christopher
Pedersen
of
Twenty-First
Securities
Corp.
,
says
the
specialists
``
were
not
able
to
handle
the
imbalances
on
the
floor
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

''
But
James
Maguire
,
chairman
of
Henderson
Brothers
Inc.
,
a
Big
Board
specialist
,
retorts
:
``
It
is
easy
to
say
the
specialist
is
n't
doing
his
job
.

When
the
dollar
is
in
free
fall
,
even
central
banks
ca
n't
stop
it
.

''
One
of
the
most
puzzling
aspects
of
Friday
's
drop
was
the
speed
with
which
the
damage
to
UAL
spilled
over
to
other
stocks
.

Market
professionals
say
that
major
arbitragers
and
others
such
as
hedge
funds
,
which
were
heavily
invested
in
UAL
and
highly
leveraged
,
could
n't
get
any
cash
out
of
their
UAL
positions
because
trading
halted
.

Once
UAL
were
to
reopen
,
such
speculators
faced
the
likelihood
of
margin
calls
--
demands
from
lenders
to
put
up
more
cash
for
stock
positions
bought
with
borrowed
funds
.

So
such
traders
quickly
tried
to
raise
cash
by
selling
other
so-called
deal
stocks
,
like
AMR
(
American
Airlines
)
and
USAir
.

But
then
trading
was
halted
because
of
order
imbalances
--
there
were
far
more
sellers
than
buyers
.

So
the
``
arbs
''
started
dumping
positions
in
their
entire
portfolios
,
including
major
blue-chip
stocks
that
have
had
large
price
runups
this
year
,
in
a
desperate
race
for
cash
.

AMR
,
subject
of
a
$
120-a-share
bid
from
Donald
Trump
,
saw
trading
in
its
stock
halted
at
$
98.625
a
share
,
down
$
.125
,
but
was
quoted
in
off-exchange
trading
at
only
$
81.50
.

Paramount
Communications
Inc.
,
the
subject
of
takeover
whispers
,
plunged
$
6.625
a
share
to
$
56.625
.

Shares
of
Hilton
Hotels
Corp.
,
which
has
put
itself
up
for
sale
,
nosedived
$
21.50
to
$
85
a
share
.

The
deluge
left
some
investors
shaken
and
angry
.

``
Do
n't
ask
me
how
I
am
,
''
said
Marshall
Front
,
a
money
manager
at
Stein
Roe
&
Farnham
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

``
This
is
incredible
.

You
have
a
classic
panic
.

''
Frederick
A.
Moran
,
president
of
Moran
Asset
Management
in
Greenwich
,
Conn.
,
said
computer-aided
``
program
traders
are
the
reason
we
had
the
last
crash
,
they
're
the
reason
we
're
having
this
crash
,
and
they
're
why
we
'll
have
the
next
crash
.

They
're
a
total
outrage
.

''
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc.
in
Chicago
,
agrees
that
none
of
Friday
's
events
by
themselves
added
up
to
a
190-point
decline
.

``
Programs
took
it
down
.

Without
the
programs
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
it
would
have
been
down
50
,
''
he
says
.

Many
market
professionals
say
it
is
still
too
soon
to
know
whether
it
was
program
traders
,
per
se
,
who
were
to
blame
,
but
they
generally
agree
that
the
computerized
trading
programs
that
have
now
been
embraced
by
an
array
of
professional
investors
and
money
managers
accounted
for
the
speed
of
the
drop
.

Traders
say
that
Friday
's
big
sellers
included
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
which
was
reportedly
executing
trades
for
a
client
switching
from
stocks
to
bonds
,
and
Tudor
Investments
,
a
prominent
player
in
the
futures
markets
.

Tudor
would
n't
comment
;
a
spokesman
for
Salomon
denied
that
it
was
a
heavy
seller
.

Michael
Steinhardt
,
who
only
last
Monday
was
threatening
a
takeover
of
USAir
using
his
8.4
%
stake
as
a
club
,
says
he
wished
he
did
n't
own
the
stock
when
Friday
's
market
left
him
with
a
$
12.9
million
paper
loss
.

``
This
market
is
a
mile
wide
and
an
inch
deep
,
''
he
says
.

But
Mr.
Steinhardt
disputed
that
he
had
been
a
heavy
seller
of
other
stocks
Friday
to
make
up
for
the
USAir
losses
.

Several
big
firms
that
do
index
arbitrage
,
in
which
traders
buy
and
sell
stocks
and
stock-index
futures
simultaneously
to
take
advantage
of
price
differentials
,
say
they
could
n't
execute
trades
because
they
could
n't
be
sure
of
prices
they
would
get
on
the
stock
exchange
floor
.

One
takeover
stock
speculator
says
that
with
individual
investors
frightened
away
from
the
market
,
the
remaining
participants
are
mainly
institutions
,
all
with
instant
access
to
the
same
information
,
and
the
same
ability
to
sell
in
an
instant
--
that
is
,
until
all
try
to
sell
at
once
.

``
If
this
is
something
that
had
happened
over
the
last
few
weeks
,
nobody
would
have
noticed
,
''
the
speculator
says
.

``
But
now
it
just
happens
in
an
hour
.

The
information
is
very
quick
;
it
's
often
inaccurate
;
and
reactions
can
be
irrational
.

''
The
speed
of
Friday
's
drop
is
likely
to
reinforce
the
perception
of
many
small
investors
that
the
markets
are
even
more
of
a
casino
and
have
n't
devised
a
manner
for
comfortably
handling
the
awesome
forces
that
technology
has
heaped
upon
them
.

Despite
two
years
of
study
,
the
marketplace
remains
one
where
ever-anxious
large
investors
,
haunted
by
memories
of
the
508-point
plunge
in
1987
and
aided
by
powerful
computers
,
can
turn
minor
market
upsets
into
major
calamities
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
.

Many
are
quick
to
emphasize
that
just
because
the
market
can
fall
as
fast
as
it
did
Friday
does
n't
mean
it
will
tank
again
,
despite
some
disquieting
similarities
between
now
and
October
1987
.

As
in
1987
,
this
latest
market
slide
was
preceded
by
sparring
between
nations
and
government
officials
over
the
dollar
.

In
1987
,
then-Treasury
Secretary
James
Baker
was
threatening
a
big
drop
in
the
dollar
if
West
Germany
raised
interest
rates
.

This
year
,
Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
seemed
to
warn
he
would
n't
lower
interest
rates
merely
to
keep
the
dollar
within
an
agreed-on
exchange
range
.

In
another
similarity
to
1987
,
the
government
was
threatening
a
crackdown
on
highly
leveraged
takeovers
.

Then
it
was
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Daniel
Rostenkowski
threatening
to
eliminate
the
tax
deductibility
of
interest
for
certain
debt-financed
takeovers
.

This
year
it
was
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
voicing
concern
about
airline
buy-outs
and
threatening
to
force
changes
in
the
United
deal
.

(
Some
think
another
Washington
factor
this
time
was
the
Senate
's
failure
to
pass
capital-gains
tax
cut
.

)
But
market
observers
point
out
that
long-term
government
bond
interest
rates
,
currently
at
7.85
%
,
are
2.5
percentage
points
lower
than
the
level
that
prevailed
in
October
1987
,
when
interest
rates
had
been
rising
for
most
of
the
year
.

Another
difference
this
year
is
that
stocks
'
price-earnings
ratios
are
much
lower
,
which
implies
that
they
may
not
be
so
overpriced
.

In
1987
,
the
average
P-E
ratio
fell
from
a
peak
of
more
than
20
to
about
13
just
after
the
crash
.

This
year
,
the
average
ratio
was
14
at
the
market
peak
one
week
ago
,
and
finished
Friday
at
13
.

On
the
other
hand
,
one
reason
those
ratios
were
so
high
in
1987
was
that
the
stock
market
had
been
anticipating
an
enormous
rise
in
corporate
earnings
,
which
did
in
fact
occur
.

Between
1987
and
1989
,
those
profits
were
projected
to
rise
by
50
%
.

But
now
those
earnings
are
hitting
a
plateau
.

Just
last
week
a
string
of
earnings
disappointments
unnerved
some
market
participants
.

Next
year
,
earnings
are
expected
to
inch
up
only
2.4
%
.

Another
factor
that
has
been
dominating
the
thinking
of
many
stock
analysts
is
the
current
plight
of
the
junk-bond
market
.

Although
UAL
,
the
second-largest
leveraged
buy-out
ever
,
was
to
have
been
financed
with
bank
debt
instead
of
junk
bonds
,
its
failure
to
obtain
financing
focused
attention
on
the
entire
market
for
leveraged
deals
,
underscoring
just
how
dependent
the
entire
market
has
become
on
junk
bonds
.

Many
stocks
owe
at
least
part
of
their
market
valuation
to
the
perception
that
they
could
soon
be
the
subject
of
a
takeover
or
buy-out
.

Attention
is
focused
on
the
so-called
breakup
value
of
the
stock
in
the
hands
of
an
imagined
acquirer
who
would
buy
the
company
at
a
big
premium
,
perhaps
planning
to
sell
it
piece
by
piece
.

Takeover
specialist
Carl
Icahn
,
whose
13.1
%
stake
in
USX
Corp.
lost
$
151.2
million
in
value
on
Friday
,
says
the
stock
market
's
downturn
may
reflect
the
end
of
a
speculative
period
that
has
generated
many
leveraged
buy-outs
that
now
face
problems
as
a
result
of
weakness
in
the
junk-bond
market
.

``
While
a
number
of
LBOs
are
fine
,
there
are
also
many
where
the
cash
flow
can
not
pay
the
interest
,
but
{
that
}
instead
are
based
on
the
buyer
selling
divisions
to
a
greater
fool
to
pay
off
the
debt
,
''
Mr.
Icahn
says
.

However
,
Mario
Gabelli
,
a
takeover-stock
investor
,
says
that
while
some
of
the
most
speculative
deals
may
now
prove
impossible
to
finance
,
``
Companies
are
still
going
to
buy
companies
around
the
world
.

''
As
on
any
day
on
Wall
Street
,
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
think
the
market
will
go
up
,
and
plenty
who
predict
a
downturn
.

``
My
advice
is
to
buy
,
''
says
Elaine
Garzarelli
,
a
market-timing
expert
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
,
who
warned
clients
of
danger
just
before
the
1987
crash
.

She
compares
the
current
drop-off
to
10%-12
%
corrections
in
1978
and
1979
.

And
Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
says
the
market
's
drop
Friday
ought
to
be
seen
in
the
context
of
a
28.7
%
runup
in
the
Dow
since
Jan.
1
of
this
year
.

In
addition
,
the
stocks
as
a
whole
are
up
60
%
from
the
day
after
the
1987
crash
.

Since
the
market
hit
a
record
level
of
2791.41
on
Monday
,
it
has
declined
by
222.15
points
,
or
8
%
.

Most
of
that
occurred
on
Friday
.

Some
think
the
selling
has
a
way
to
go
.

James
Awad
,
president
of
BMI
Capital
Corp.
in
New
York
,
says
that
despite
the
more
favorable
valuation
levels
,
stocks
could
still
tumble
several
hundred
points
in
the
event
of
a
breakdown
in
``
the
internal
structure
of
the
market
.

''
Although
professionals
were
bracing
themselves
for
some
heavy
early
selling
on
overseas
markets
,
many
did
n't
detect
any
widespread
panic
over
the
weekend
among
U.S.
institutions
and
individual
investors
.

Many
mutual
funds
have
big
cash
reserves
--
which
they
lacked
in
1987
--
as
a
cushion
against
a
possible
cascade
of
telephone
sell
orders
today
.

Fidelity
,
which
was
forced
to
sell
$
800
million
of
stocks
in
the
1987
crash
,
has
quadrupled
the
cash
level
of
the
giant
Magellan
fund
.

The
Boston
firm
says
redemptions
in
stock
funds
since
the
Friday
market
drop
have
equaled
less
than
15
%
of
those
funds
'
total
cash
position
of
about
$
2
billion
.

``
Two
years
ago
there
were
massive
redemption
levels
over
the
weekend
and
a
lot
of
fear
around
,
''
says
C.
Bruce
Johnstone
,
who
runs
Fidelity
's
$
5
billion
Equity-Income
Fund
.

``
This
feels
more
like
a
one-shot
deal
--
people
are
n't
panicking
.

''
Liquidity
also
appears
to
be
far
healthier
than
it
was
in
1987
,
when
a
lack
of
it
brought
the
financial
system
close
to
break-down
.

Over
the
weekend
,
Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Greenspan
phoned
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
to
reassure
them
that
the
Fed
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
if
needed
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

And
Mr.
Phelan
,
the
Big
Board
's
chairman
,
says
that
the
exchange
has
n't
turned
up
any
capital
problems
among
its
49
specialist
firms
,
suggesting
that
the
Big
Board
will
have
the
capacity
to
make
orderly
markets
even
if
volume
is
heavy
.

Carl
N.
Singer
was
named
chairman
of
this
communications
and
electronics
equipment
supplier
,
succeeding
Louis
H.
Wolcott
,
who
resigned
from
the
board
.

Mr.
Singer
will
continue
in
his
current
positions
as
chairman
of
Miami-based
Fundamental
Management
Corp.
,
Microdyne
's
largest
stockholder
,
and
chairman
of
Mineola
,
N.Y.-based
Robeson
Industries
Corp
.

Robert
P.
Adelman
,
former
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Rogers
Group
,
was
named
to
the
Microdyne
board
slot
vacated
by
Mr.
Wolcott
,
who
will
continue
with
Microdyne
as
an
assistant
to
the
president
.

If
one
thing
was
clear
in
the
chaos
of
Friday
's
market
sell-off
,
it
was
that
the
collapse
of
the
buy-out
of
UAL
Corp.
set
the
whole
thing
off
.

But
,
it
turns
out
,
Wall
Street
--
quick
to
read
tea
leaves
and
quick
to
panic
--
may
have
reached
the
wrong
conclusion
about
the
buy-out
's
unraveling
.

As
word
spread
Friday
that
many
of
the
world
's
biggest
banks
had
refused
to
participate
in
the
$
6.79
billion
leveraged
transaction
,
the
financial
markets
assumed
the
worst
:
If
the
management
of
a
blue-chip
outfit
like
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
ca
n't
get
financing
,
then
takeovers
in
general
must
be
headed
toward
extinction
.

The
market
,
already
chastened
by
a
number
of
leveraged
buy-outs
gone
bad
,
responded
in
a
flood
of
sell
orders
.

Yet
interviews
with
the
bankers
who
turned
down
the
UAL
proposal
suggest
the
market
may
have
misinterpreted
its
significance
.

The
buy-out
of
UAL
by
a
group
made
up
of
management
,
the
pilots
union
and
British
Airways
PLC
,
ran
into
difficulty
because
of
its
own
unique
problems
,
they
say
.

Banks
did
n't
suddenly
become
unwilling
to
finance
takeovers
,
they
just
did
n't
like
the
looks
of
this
particular
deal
.

Specifically
,
the
bankers
said
that
UAL
's
management
and
advisers
pushed
too
hard
,
trying
to
keep
too
much
of
the
potential
profit
for
themselves
.

The
airline
's
top
two
officers
,
chief
executive
Stephen
M.
Wolf
and
chief
financial
officer
John
C.
Pope
,
for
example
,
would
have
made
a
total
of
more
than
$
100
million
on
the
buy-out
through
stock
options
they
hold
,
even
though
their
proposal
called
for
them
to
put
only
$
15
million
of
their
own
funds
into
the
deal
.

Moreover
,
fees
and
interest
rates
paid
to
the
banks
would
have
been
stingy
--
far
below
those
in
comparable
takeovers
.

The
banks
also
said
they
were
worried
that
United
's
rosy
projections
of
future
income
--
and
therefore
its
ability
to
pay
off
the
debt
--
did
n't
adequately
take
into
account
the
bumpy
nature
of
the
airline
industry
.

From
a
lender
's
point
of
view
,
``
it
's
one
of
the
worst
big
takeover
proposals
we
've
seen
,
''
said
an
official
of
First
Chicago
Corp.
,
one
of
the
banks
asked
to
finance
the
buy-out
,
which
notably
did
n't
include
junk
bonds
.

Even
so
,
banks
such
as
First
Chicago
,
which
has
a
long
history
of
ties
to
UAL
,
stretched
their
lending
guidelines
as
far
as
possible
in
hopes
of
making
the
proposal
work
.

``
We
really
gave
this
thing
nine
looks
,
''
the
First
Chicago
officer
said
.

It
was
the
job
of
A.D.
Frazier
,
First
Chicago
's
commercial
lending
chief
,
to
call
the
buy-out
group
and
put
the
best
possible
face
on
the
news
.

``
We
called
them
back
and
said
if
they
needed
us
--
if
it
would
make
a
difference
--
we
'd
come
in
,
''
another
officer
familiar
with
the
matter
said
.

Of
course
,
it
was
n't
even
close
.

Other
U.S.
banks
and
,
more
importantly
,
those
in
Japan
,
also
said
no
.

In
the
end
,
the
proposal
never
got
far
beyond
the
original
financing
promises
made
by
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
which
together
had
agreed
to
commit
$
3
billion
and
said
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
they
could
raise
an
additional
$
4.2
billion
.

Representatives
and
advisers
to
the
buy-out
group
,
called
Airline
Acquisition
Corp.
,
met
throughout
the
weekend
in
an
effort
to
revise
their
$
300-a-share
offer
.

But
prospects
of
quickly
putting
together
a
new
deal
appeared
bleak
.

It
is
``
still
unclear
whether
this
can
be
easily
fixed
,
''
one
official
close
to
the
transaction
said
yesterday
afternoon
.

A
pilots
union
official
said
the
group
is
likely
to
wait
and
see
what
the
stock
market
does
Monday
before
making
any
decisions
.

``
We
've
got
a
lot
of
homework
to
do
,
a
lot
of
work
ahead
of
us
,
''
said
H.
Bruce
Bernstein
,
a
lawyer
at
Sidley
&
Austin
in
Chicago
,
which
is
representing
the
bank
group
.

Both
the
banks
'
decision
to
decline
financing
and
the
stock
market
's
reaction
caught
the
buy-out
group
off
guard
.

Friday
's
dominoes
began
falling
at
2:30
p.m.
,
when
the
stock
exchange
halted
trading
in
UAL
,
pending
news
.

The
news
came
at
2:54
.

Funds
committed
by
banks
for
the
buy-out
``
are
not
sufficient
,
''
the
acquisition
group
announced
.

UAL
was
trading
at
$
279.75
at
the
time
of
the
halt
and
never
reopened
for
trading
Friday
.

However
,
it
was
later
quoted
by
off-exchange
market
makers
at
as
low
as
$
230
a
share
.

At
3:30
,
with
the
market
now
in
a
free
fall
,
representatives
of
the
buy-out
group
scrambled
to
a
hastily
called
meeting
at
Citicorp
's
offices
at
399
Park
Avenue
in
New
York
.

The
group
was
trying
to
assess
what
it
would
take
to
resuscitate
the
deal
.

On
the
way
to
the
session
,
some
huddled
around
a
Quotron
machine
that
was
in
the
hallway
outside
the
meeting
room
.

``
The
Dow
's
going
down
,
down
,
down
,
''
said
one
observer
in
amazement
.

The
meeting
itself
,
held
in
the
corporate
finance
department
on
the
ninth
floor
,
was
disorganized
,
as
members
of
Citicorp
's
and
Chase
's
syndication
departments
called
other
banks
trying
to
figure
out
why
they
had
rejected
the
deal
.

At
3:55
,
five
minutes
before
the
market
closed
,
the
meeting
began
.

Gathered
around
a
long
table
that
filled
the
huge
conference
room
were
about
30
people
,
including
representatives
of
Citicorp
,
Chase
Manhattan
,
United
Airlines
,
British
Airways
,
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
,
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
Skadden
Arps
(
Mr.
Wolf
's
counsel
)
and
Paul
Weiss
(
lawyer
for
the
pilots
union
)
.

One
person
who
was
n't
present
:
Mr.
Wolf
himself
who
,
confident
that
the
deal
would
go
through
,
was
returning
from
Europe
,
where
he
had
pitched
the
proposal
to
several
big
European
banks
.

``
People
were
surprised
,
shocked
and
upset
,
''
said
an
official
at
the
meeting
.

Mr.
Wolf
,
reached
at
his
Chicago
home
Saturday
,
declined
to
comment
.

As
they
met
to
review
what
had
gone
wrong
,
the
buy-out
group
quickly
discovered
that
one
of
the
big
roadblocks
had
been
Japanese
lenders
.

Although
they
had
provided
the
lion
's
share
of
the
financing
on
the
Northwest
Airlines
buy-out
just
a
few
months
before
,
Japanese
banks
had
said
no
to
UAL
.

The
Japanese
apparently
balked
at
several
aspects
of
the
proposal
.

A
senior
executive
at
one
of
Japan
's
biggest
banks
says
the
UAL
deal
``
was
stretched
.

It
's
a
cyclical
industry
,
and
all
the
projections
that
the
banks
are
working
off
are
straight
up
.

So
where
's
the
cycle
?
''
Japanese
lenders
also
recently
have
grown
more
conservative
toward
highly
leveraged
transactions
,
partly
because
of
the
recent
cash-squeeze
at
Canada
's
Campeau
Corp.
following
its
leveraged
purchase
of
Federated
Department
Stores
Inc.
last
year
.

Japanese
banks
are
worried
that
the
government
might
issue
restrictive
guidelines
unless
the
banks
hold
down
the
number
of
risky
leveraged-buy-out
loans
they
make
,
says
a
Japanese
monetary
official
.

``
So
,
they
are
very
cautious
,
''
he
says
.

A
third
problem
was
the
potential
for
labor
unrest
at
UAL
,
something
that
makes
the
Japanese
particularly
skittish
.

The
Japanese
banks
were
reminded
of
the
labor
tensions
at
UAL
all
last
week
.

On
Wednesday
,
the
machinists
union
asked
the
U.S.
Labor
Department
to
step
in
to
stop
the
buy-out
.

On
Thursday
,
at
their
national
convention
in
Las
Vegas
,
machinists
union
leaders
discussed
launching
an
allout
campaign
against
UAL
Chairman
Wolf
specifically
.

The
machinists
have
opposed
the
buy-out
because
they
were
n't
invited
to
participate
in
the
deal
and
because
they
fear
all
the
debt
that
would
be
taken
on
in
the
transaction
would
overburden
the
company
.

Machinists
union
leader
John
Peterpaul
also
made
the
union
's
views
known
in
telephone
conversations
with
representatives
of
Mitsubishi
Bank
,
one
of
the
Japanese
banks
that
was
considering
participating
in
the
financing
.

In
those
conversations
,
he
reiterated
the
union
's
position
that
it
would
seek
significant
wage
increases
in
the
round
of
contract
talks
set
to
begin
next
month
.

The
Japanese
banks
,
however
,
were
n't
the
only
ones
worried
.

At
First
Chicago
,
executives
were
sharply
divided
on
whether
the
bank
should
participate
--
and
what
consequences
there
would
be
if
it
rejected
its
longtime
client
.

Among
other
things
,
the
bank
feared
``
we
'd
look
like
dogs
''
if
United
was
able
to
piece
together
the
financing
and
First
Chicago
was
absent
,
a
top
lending
officer
said
.

United
's
Mr.
Pope
was
warning
that
just
that
could
happen
.

``
Pope
told
us
there
's
no
question
the
banks
are
going
to
sign
up
.

''
As
the
Thursday
afternoon
deadline
for
banks
neared
,
some
lending
officers
at
First
Chicago
remained
in
favor
of
joining
the
financing
group
,
but
the
bank
's
``
credit
police
''
were
opposed
,
citing
the
high
degree
of
risk
associated
with
the
loan
.

A
vote
of
top
officers
,
including
Chairman
Barry
F.
Sullivan
,
Thursday
morning
was
strongly
against
the
loan
.

One
official
close
to
the
transaction
said
banks
were
worried
about
the
amount
of
assets
the
buy-out
group
had
to
cover
the
loans
.

He
said
in
the
NWA
Inc.
acquisition
,
banks
were
secured
with
well
over
$
1
in
assets
for
every
$
1
of
loan
exposure
.

In
the
UAL
transaction
,
however
,
a
banker
's
loans
would
have
been
secured
with
less
than
$
1
in
assets
for
every
dollar
of
loans
.

Another
problem
:
The
buy-out
group
's
financial
projections
did
n't
assume
any
type
of
recession
in
the
near
future
.

For
instance
,
the
group
projected
that
revenue
would
increase
nearly
10
%
annually
over
the
next
few
years
.

It
estimated
that
yields
--
the
amount
of
income
the
airline
takes
in
on
ticket
sales
--
would
increase
an
average
of
3.5
%
a
year
,
despite
the
ups
and
downs
the
industry
has
suffered
in
the
last
10
years
.

The
projections
also
assumed
that
load
factors
--
the
number
of
seats
filled
per
aircraft
--
would
remain
a
stable
66.7
%
or
thereabouts
,
even
though
domestic
travel
has
been
weakening
.

According
to
a
machinists
union
analysis
of
the
transaction
that
will
be
presented
to
the
Department
of
Transportation
and
a
House
Aviation
subcommittee
later
this
week
,
a
``
mild
recession
''
would
result
in
the
company
's
taking
in
$
3.5
billion
less
cash
in
the
next
four
years
than
forecast
by
the
buy-out
group
.

Clearly
,
any
new
bid
will
have
to
include
more
profit
for
lenders
and
that
probably
means
less
cash
for
UAL
shareholders
,
including
the
heavily
stock-optioned
Messrs.
Wolf
and
Pope
.

Citicorp
,
the
lead
bank
on
the
financing
proposal
,
meanwhile
,
has
a
resounding
flop
on
its
hands
.

It
agreed
to
put
up
$
2
billion
itself
,
while
co-lead
Chase
Manhattan
agreed
to
provide
$
1
billion
.

The
two
New
York
banks
have
already
been
paid
combined
fees
of
$
8
million
for
the
commitments
.

Citicorp
and
Chase
told
the
buy-out
group
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
they
could
raise
the
remaining
$
4.2
billion
needed
to
finance
the
deal
.

(
The
$
7.2
billion
the
banks
said
they
needed
includes
some
refinancing
of
existing
debt
,
and
is
therefore
greater
than
the
$
6.79
billion
offered
for
UAL
.

)
Citibank
's
confidence
was
bolstered
as
recently
as
10
days
ago
when
representatives
of
120
banks
that
had
expressed
interest
in
the
UAL
transaction
attended
a
meeting
with
Citibank
representatives
.

``
Ninety
percent
of
the
questions
asked
were
friendly
,
''
said
a
person
who
attended
.

``
There
were
a
lot
of
indications
both
before
and
after
that
this
was
a
deal
people
thought
well
of
.

''
But
Citibank
's
confidence
may
also
have
bordered
on
arrogance
,
other
bankers
contend
.

The
recent
buy-out
financing
of
NWA
,
Northwest
Airlines
'
parent
,
for
instance
,
was
a
much
more
collaborative
effort
among
several
U.S.
banks
.

It
was
a
far
safer
deal
for
lenders
,
since
NWA
had
a
healthier
cash
flow
and
more
collateral
on
hand
.

And
banks
'
fees
were
much
higher
as
well
.

No
wonder
,
then
,
that
lenders
lined
up
to
participate
.

``
Perhaps
lenders
are
finally
recognizing
that
the
stream
of
airline
cash
flow
may
be
less
predictable
and
a
higher
risk
than
previously
considered
,
''
said
Karen
Firestone
,
a
money
manager
at
Fidelity
Investments
in
Boston
.

Ms.
Firestone
added
,
``
In
the
same
week
that
USAir
announces
they
might
lose
money
in
the
quarter
,
United
is
trying
to
get
money
for
a
$
300-a-share
buy-out
.

It
's
kind
of
like
,
what
's
wrong
with
this
picture
?
''
According
to
bankers
and
others
familiar
with
the
financing
proposal
,
several
things
need
to
be
fixed
:
Fees
paid
to
the
banks
,
set
at
about
1.5
%
of
loans
,
are
low
compared
with
other
buy-outs
,
which
have
paid
2
%
to
2.5
%
.

Because
buy-out
loans
often
get
refinanced
--
and
thus
paid
off
--
ahead
of
schedule
,
banks
ca
n't
count
on
years
of
interest
income
from
these
loans
.

They
like
deals
to
be
``
front-loaded
''
with
fees
.

What
's
more
,
fees
in
the
UAL
proposal
were
n't
structured
to
encourage
banks
to
commit
to
lending
large
amounts
of
money
.

The
interest
rate
promised
the
banks
was
also
relatively
low
;
2
%
over
the
rate
banks
charge
each
other
in
London
,
known
as
LIBOR
.

And
bankers
were
concerned
that
there
were
n't
any
junk
bondholders
or
other
buyers
of
subordinated
debt
standing
between
potential
losses
and
the
banks
'
senior
loans
.

``
Most
of
these
leveraged
deals
have
been
done
with
a
pretty
heavy
layer
of
junk
,
''
a
First
Chicago
executive
said
.

``
This
one
has
zippo
.

''
Because
the
junk
bond
market
has
ground
to
a
halt
since
Campeau
's
problems
were
made
manifest
,
so-called
bridge
loans
from
Wall
Street
firms
or
other
sources
could
be
used
for
subordinated
debt
in
the
UAL
deal
.

In
the
meantime
,
though
,
airline
executives
,
union
officials
,
lawyers
,
investment
bankers
and
even
the
machinists
will
have
one
eye
on
United
and
one
eye
on
the
stock
market
they
helped
to
tank
.

Says
an
official
working
on
the
buy-out
:
``
As
time
goes
by
,
you
have
to
get
more
worried
.

The
dollar
's
fall
on
Friday
could
signal
a
new
bout
of
weakness
for
the
U.S.
currency
and
--
if
it
declines
much
further
--
possibly
the
end
of
the
U.S.
currency
's
long-term
climb
that
began
in
early
1988
.

``
The
entire
sentiment
has
changed
;
the
dollar
bulls
definitely
have
been
shaken
,
''
says
Jack
Kessler
,
senior
vice
president
in
charge
of
New
York
foreign-exchange
operations
for
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
.

He
and
others
cite
Friday
's
plunge
in
U.S.
stock
prices
and
the
narrowing
difference
between
interest
rates
in
the
U.S.
and
some
of
its
major
trading
partners
,
particularly
West
Germany
and
Japan
.

Many
analysts
also
suspect
that
the
Federal
Reserve
has
begun
to
reduce
interest
rates
and
could
go
further
.

Lower
interest
rates
usually
diminish
a
currency
's
appeal
to
international
investors
and
speculators
.

By
very
late
in
New
York
on
Friday
,
the
dollar
had
tumbled
to
1.8655
West
German
marks
and
141.50
yen
--
its
lows
for
the
day
--
from
1.9083
marks
and
144.17
yen
on
Thursday
.

The
British
pound
rose
to
$
1.5840
from
$
1.5523
a
day
earlier
.

In
Tokyo
Monday
,
the
dollar
opened
for
trading
at
139.30
yen
,
down
from
Friday
's
Tokyo
close
of
144
yen
,
and
1.8340
marks
down
from
Friday
's
close
of
1.8720
.

By
late
morning
,
the
dollar
had
recovered
somewhat
and
was
trading
at
140.90
yen
and
1.8535
marks
.

``
If
the
stock
market
keeps
going
down
on
Monday
,
you
're
going
to
see
a
lot
of
people
selling
dollars
,
''
says
Robert
Fio
Rito
,
a
trader
at
Harris
Trust
&
Savings
Bank
in
Chicago
.

He
added
:
``
The
mark
is
a
good
place
to
be
.

''
In
the
short-run
,
the
dollar
's
fate
depends
largely
on
the
performance
of
the
U.S.
stock
market
today
as
well
as
the
Fed
's
and
other
central
banks
'
reaction
to
what
happens
in
all
world
equity
markets
,
say
traders
and
analysts
.

Not
only
does
the
dollar
play
a
key
role
in
determining
the
direction
and
health
of
the
U.S.
economy
,
but
the
speed
with
which
it
rises
or
falls
is
also
of
major
concern
to
U.S.
and
foreign
policy
makers
.

A
precipitous
fall
by
the
dollar
could
reignite
U.S.
inflationary
pressures
by
raising
the
price
of
imports
and
prompting
U.S.
manufacturers
to
increase
domestic
prices
.

But
if
the
U.S.
currency
were
to
decline
in
a
controlled
manner
,
it
would
contribute
to
the
four-year
effort
by
the
U.S.
and
its
major
trading
partners
to
reduce
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
and
correspondingly
large
Japanese
and
West
German
surpluses
.

That
's
because
a
weaker
dollar
makes
U.S.
exports
less
expensive
while
raising
the
price
of
imports
to
American
consumers
.

Furthermore
,
in
the
current
stock
market
climate
,
the
dollar
is
the
wire
through
which
foreigners
telegraph
their
preference
--
or
distaste
--
for
U.S.
securities
and
signal
their
confidence
in
the
American
economy
and
financial
system
.

If
foreigners
dump
U.S.
stocks
and
return
to
the
safety
of
their
home
markets
--
as
they
did
in
October
1987
--
they
must
simultaneously
also
sell
dollars
for
their
own
currencies
.

Those
transactions
,
in
turn
,
could
weaken
the
dollar
.

Even
if
foreigners
just
withhold
from
buying
additional
U.S.
securities
,
they
reduce
the
demand
for
dollars
.

Conversely
,
when
foreigners
buy
American
securities
,
they
increase
the
demand
for
the
U.S.
currency
.

However
,
foreigners
who
merely
sell
their
American
shares
and
buy
U.S.
bonds
do
n't
affect
the
exchange
rate
.

Initially
on
Friday
,
the
dollar
shot
up
in
early
New
York
activity
after
both
the
producer
price
index
and
retail
sales
for
September
came
out
higher
than
most
analysts
expected
.

Traders
concluded
that
U.S.
interest
rates
would
remain
firm
,
and
the
dollar
quickly
climbed
to
its
intraday
highs
of
1.9140
marks
and
144.80
yen
.

But
the
rally
quickly
fizzled
under
the
weight
of
trader
chagrin
that
the
currency
had
n't
risen
further
,
profit-taking
and
unconfirmed
reports
that
the
Fed
was
selling
dollars
.

A
few
hours
later
with
the
dollar
trading
at
1.8895
marks
and
143
yen
,
the
stock
market
began
plunging
,
taking
the
U.S.
currency
with
it
.

Surprisingly
,
while
trading
was
hectic
,
dealers
say
that
volume
was
unexpectedly
moderate
.

``
You
're
talking
about
a
really
thin
and
volatile
Friday
the
13th
,
''
says
Carmine
Rotondo
,
chief
corporate
dealer
for
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
.

``
The
decline
of
the
dollar
was
more
a
function
of
market
makers
dragging
bids
down
than
people
massively
selling
,
''
adds
Richard
Witten
,
vice
president
in
charge
of
foreign-exchange
operations
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

From
its
intraday
highs
four
weeks
ago
,
the
U.S.
currency
has
fallen
almost
7
%
against
the
mark
and
5
%
against
the
yen
.

In
Friday
's
trading
alone
the
dollar
fell
more
than
2.5
%
against
the
mark
and
2.3
%
against
the
yen
from
its
high
in
early
New
York
trading
.

Currently
,
the
dollar
stands
close
to
the
upper
limits
of
its
so-called
Louvre
trading
ranges
of
1.70-to-1.90
marks
and
120-140
yen
,
within
which
most
traders
and
economists
believe
the
Group
of
Seven
major
industrial
countries
have
tried
to
keep
it
since
February
1987
.

The
G-7
includes
the
U.S.
,
Japan
,
West
Germany
,
France
,
Britain
,
Italy
and
Canada
.

``
For
all
of
its
unfortunate
aspects
,
Friday
's
events
make
it
easier
for
the
G-7
process
to
continue
,
''
says
Robert
Feldman
,
an
international
economist
at
Salomon
Brothers
Inc
.

He
added
:
``
Until
Friday
morning
,
market
people
were
contending
that
further
interest-rate
hikes
were
necessary
to
keep
the
dollar
bulls
from
running
over
{
the
central
banks
}
;
there
seemed
to
be
a
sense
of
the
dollar
bulls
coming
back
and
taking
control
again
.

''
In
the
past
week
and
a
half
,
major
European
countries
--
led
by
West
Germany
and
Japan
--
raised
official
domestic
interest
rates
,
mostly
to
keep
their
currencies
from
falling
further
and
to
stem
the
inflationary
impact
of
those
declines
.

Mr.
Feldman
added
:
``
But
that
's
not
the
way
things
look
now
;
the
G-7
have
some
breathing
room
.

''
Analysts
say
that
the
dollar
's
future
depends
on
whether
U.S.
stock
prices
keep
falling
;
whether
the
Fed
is
forced
to
ease
credit
to
ease
any
crisis
;
whether
foreign
equity
markets
also
fall
,
and
how
central
banks
abroad
react
to
those
circumstances
.

Many
dealers
are
betting
that
the
Fed
will
have
to
ease
monetary
policy
,
if
it
has
n't
already
.

The
questions
are
how
much
and
under
what
circumstances
.

``
If
nothing
happens
abroad
and
the
Fed
is
forced
to
ease
here
to
calm
markets
,
the
dollar
is
going
to
go
down
;
there
would
be
a
flight
to
quality
as
people
start
to
worry
about
the
U.S.
financial
system
,
''
says
Michael
D.
Andrews
,
a
vice
president
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

The
dollar
,
he
adds
,
``
could
take
a
pretty
big
hit
,
''
if
the
Fed
were
perceived
as
``
being
in
a
very
difficult
situation
where
it
was
fighting
a
fire
.

''
In
fact
,
Mr.
Andrews
and
some
other
traders
and
analysts
say
that
it
is
n't
impossible
to
paint
a
scenario
where
the
Fed
might
have
to
intervene
to
support
the
dollar
.

Analysts
believe
that
the
Fed
can
tolerate
a
dollar
as
low
as
1.80
marks
,
a
level
at
which
U.S.
companies
are
competitive
in
overseas
markets
and
yet
is
n't
too
inflationary
domestically
.

Much
depends
on
how
foreigners
react
.

If
they
merely
sell
American
shares
and
buy
U.S.
bonds
,
that
wo
n't
affect
the
dollar
.

But
if
,
as
in
October
1987
,
they
dump
dollar-denominated
securities
and
run
to
foreign
markets
,
they
will
increase
pressure
on
the
dollar
to
fall
.

Some
of
that
already
began
on
Friday
.

``
Many
of
the
banks
in
the
U.S.
called
their
counterparts
in
the
Far
East
and
Europe
,
''
says
Chase
Manhattan
's
Mr.
Kessler
.

``
And
dealers
who
had
gone
home
in
the
Far
East
and
Europe
long
dollars
started
selling
when
they
were
awakened
during
the
night
and
told
that
the
stock
market
was
down
,
that
Fed
funds
were
at
8
%
and
that
the
Fed
might
begin
to
ease
,
''
Mr.
Kessler
adds
.

Salomon
Brothers
'
Mr.
Feldman
says
that
further
evidence
of
foreign
selling
was
the
dollar
's
plunge
Friday
at
the
same
time
the
bond
market
was
rallying
--
which
has
n't
occurred
in
months
.

``
That
may
be
a
signal
of
a
turning
point
in
the
strategies
of
international
portfolio
managers
,
''
he
says
.

Harris
Trust
's
Mr.
Fio
Rito
predicts
that
``
an
equity
market
hit
will
trigger
further
liquidation
;
with
the
Japanese
and
Germans
raising
{
interest
}
rates
,
the
fundamentals
changed
for
the
dollar
.

''
Indeed
,
Salomon
's
Mr.
Feldman
notes
that
in
September
yields
on
three-month
Eurodollar
deposits
were
1.5
percentage
points
more
than
on
three-month
marks
.

By
late
Friday
,
that
spread
had
narrowed
to
0.19
percentage
point
.

``
People
began
to
question
shifting
{
funds
}
for
differences
this
small
,
''
he
adds
.

Many
dealers
are
looking
to
see
if
the
dollar
tumbles
below
1.85
marks
,
a
key
psychological
and
technical
level
to
the
many
traders
who
use
charts
to
predict
currency
movements
.

``
It
breaks
through
1.85
,
then
you
begin
to
question
whether
the
dollar
's
long-term
uptrend
that
began
in
early
1988
is
still
in
place
,
''
says
Merrill
Lynch
's
Mr.
Andrews
.

The
dollar
is
n't
without
its
boosters
,
who
point
to
reduced
U.S.
budget
and
trade
deficits
as
well
as
its
value
as
a
so-called
haven
currency
in
a
world
rife
with
political
instability
.

``
I
see
a
stronger
dollar
mid
to
long-term
,
''
says
Gilles
Bazy-Sire
,
a
first
vice
president
at
Societe
Generale
Securities
Corp.
in
New
York
.

He
says
that
based
on
the
price
of
a
similar
basket
of
goods
and
services
in
major
industrial
countries
,
the
dollar
currently
``
is
very
cheap
.

''
That
,
he
says
,
``
should
increase
the
demand
for
dollars
''
by
investors
who
want
to
buy
real
U.S.
assets
,
such
as
real
estate
and
companies
.

Dollar
doubters
point
to
the
prospects
of
a
bumpy
U.S.
stock
market
at
best
,
and
the
prospect
of
lower
U.S.
interest
rates
.

What
's
more
,
many
forecasters
predict
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
will
begin
to
widen
again
in
1990
.

In
fact
,
many
analysts
estimate
that
the
trade
gap
for
August
--
to
be
released
tomorrow
--
widened
to
as
much
as
$
9.6
billion
from
$
7.6
billion
the
previous
month
.

Barring
a
catastrophe
in
the
U.S.
stock
market
,
Mr.
Kessler
believes
that
the
dollar
in
the
near
term
should
weaken
further
to
about
1.8650-1.8850
marks
and
142-143.50
yen
.

But
he
adds
:
``
My
gut
feeling
is
that
we
can
even
see
it
go
lower
.

''
On
the
Commodity
Exchange
in
New
York
Friday
,
gold
for
current
delivery
settled
at
$
363.30
an
ounce
,
down
10
cents
.

Estimated
volume
was
a
light
two
million
ounces
.

In
early
trading
in
Hong
Kong
Monday
,
gold
was
quoted
at
about
$
368.27
an
ounce
,
up
$
2.81
an

from
Saturday

close
of

ARBITRAGE
:
Technically
,
the
simultaneous
buying
and
selling
of
related
securities
to
take
advantage
of
small
differences
in
price
.

The
term
has
come
to
be
applied
to
buying
stocks
in
companies
that
are
,
or
are
rumored
to
be
,
takeover
targets
.

INDEX
ARBITRAGE
:
The
simultaneous
trading
in
stock-index
markets
and
the
underlying
groups
of
stocks
to
take
advantage
of
temporary
discrepancies
in
prices
.

JUNK
BONDS
:
High-yielding
,
high-risk
debt
securities
rated
double-B
or
lower
by
the
credit-rating
agencies
.

LEVERAGED
BUY-OUT
:
The
purchase
of
a
company
by
a
small
group
of
investors
financed
largely
by
debt
,
often
junk
bonds
.

MARGIN
CALL
:
A
demand
upon
an
investor
to
put
up
more
collateral
for
securities
bought
on
credit
.

The
lender
,
usually
a
bank
or
brokerage
firm
,
makes
the
call
when
the
equity
in
the
investor
's
account
falls
below
a
standard
set
by
a
stock
exchange
or
firm
.

OPTIONS
:
A
``
put
''
option
permits
a
holder
to
sell
a
stock
at
a
specified
price
within
a
limited
period
.

A
``
call
''
option
permits
an
investor
to
buy
stock
at
a
specified
price
within
a
limited
period
.

An
index
option
lets
the
investor
buy
or
sell
the
``
basket
''
of
stocks
represented
by
a
stock-market
index
.

PORTFOLIO
INSURANCE
:
A
method
of
hedging
a
stock
portfolio
,
usually
by
selling
futures
contracts
on
stock
indexes
when
the
market
falls
.

STOCK-INDEX
FUTURES
:
Contracts
for
future
delivery
of
an
amount
of
cash
based
on
an
index
of
stock
prices
,
such
as
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
index
or
the
Major
Market
Index
.

A
trader
buying
a
December
S&P
500
stock-index
futures
contract
at
a
price
of
$
200
today
,
for
instance
,
would
be
agreeing
to
take
delivery
next
month
of
500
times
that
amount
in
cash
,
or
$
100,000
.

Traders
would
almost
always
close
out
that
position
by
selling
an
offsetting
futures
contract
.

If
the
stock
market
--
and
correspondingly
the
stock
index
--
rose
before
the
trader
closed
out
his
position
,
he
would
make
a
profit
because
he
could
sell
an
offsetting
contract
at
a
higher
price
,
taking
in
more
money
than
he
had
to
spend
.

If
the
market
fell
,
the
trader
would
lose
money
because
he
would
have
to
sell
an
offsetting
contract
at
a
lower
price
.

Futures
are
used
to
hedge
against
fluctuations

)
``
Circuit-breaker
''
trading
halts
on
this
city
's
futures
and
options
exchanges
may
have
speeded
the
stock
market
's
fall
on
Friday
.

Stock-index
futures
trading
on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
and
stock-index
options
trading
on
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
initially
closed
within
a
few
minutes
of
each
other
Friday
afternoon
.

But
trading
in
the
nation
's
most
active
stock-index
option
on
the
CBOE
did
n't
reopen
for
the
day
.

As
a
result
,
options
traders
were
forced
to
sell
elsewhere
,
driving
futures
and
stock
prices
lower
,
traders
said
.

And
when
trading
in
the
Chicago
Merc
's
stock-index
futures
had
finally
halted
for
the
day
as
well
,
sell
orders
cascaded
onto
the
floor
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
adding
to
the
rout
.

What
's
more
,
in
anticipation
of
the
trading
halts
many
traders
--
worried
about
being
unable
to
trade
at
lower
prices
--
sold
futures
and
options
contracts
,
thereby
knocking
prices
still
lower
.

The
wildly
fluctuating
markets
appeared
to
have
claimed
at
least
one
victim
.

Fossett
Corp.
,
an
options-trading
firm
,
said
last
night
that
it
is
transferring
all
of
its
customer
accounts
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
.

Stephen
Fossett
,
president
and
sole
owner
of
the
company
,
said
that
he
was
making
the
transfers
as
a
result
of
a
substantial
cash
squeeze
stemming
from
numerous
calls
for
cash
and
margin
money
on
Friday
by
several
stock-option
and
futures
exchanges
.

``
All
of
our
obligations
were
met
,
''
Mr.
Fossett
said
.

Although
few
other
trading
firms
here
or
in
New
York
appeared
to
be
in
immediate
financial
difficulty
,
Friday
's
volatility
also
underscored
the
need
for
exchanges
in
Chicago
to
hasten
the
common
clearing
of
futures
and
options
contracts
,
traders
said
.

``
I
'm
very
disappointed
.

The
trading
halts
in
futures
and
options
may
have
done
more
harm
than
good
,
''
said
Jeffrey
Tabak
,
a
partner
in
the
investment
firm
of
Miller
Tabak
Hirsch
&
Co.
,
and
a
member
of
the
presidential
commission
that
recommended
intermarket
circuit
breakers
be
adopted
.

The
situation
``
is
clearly
uncorrected
,
''
said
Glenn
W.
Clark
,
a
Washington
,
D.C.
,
author
on
the
futures
markets
.

``
All
{
a
trading
halt
}
does
is
smooth
the
movement
.

''
The
stock-index
futures
and
options
also
are
likely
to
weigh
heavily
on
the
stock
market
this
morning
.

The
S&P
500
index
future
that
expires
in
December
closed
at
328.85
,
nearly
five
index
points
below
the
333.65
closing
price
of
the
S&P
500
index
itself
,
which
is
based
on
the
value
of
the
500
stocks
in
the
index
.

The
wide
discount
of
the
index
futures
price
against
the
actual
index
may
tempt
program
traders
,
who
profit
from
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
futures
,
to
buy
the
relatively
cheap
futures
and
sell
stocks
,
sending
the
stock
market
still
lower
.

That
selling
could
pull
futures
prices
lower
as
well
,
triggering
another
round
of
program
selling
.

Traders
emphasized
,
however
,
that
the
price
relationship
between
stocks
and
futures
could
change
substantially
by
this
morning
's
start
of
trading
,
based
on
trading
overnight
in
Japan
,
an
influx
of
new
orders
or
other
events
.

Trading
first
halted
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
contract
on
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
at
2:07
p.m.
CST
,
after
the
contract
had
fallen
12
index
points
.

It
reopened
at
2:30
p.m.
,
but
traded
freely
for
only
15
minutes
before
hitting
its
daily
limit
of
30
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
.

Sporadic
trading
occurred
at
that
level
for
the
next
half-hour
until
the
contract
's
normal
closing
time
of
3:15
p.m
.

The
trading
halts
'
main
effect
,
as
designed
,
was
to
permit
the
stock
market
to
catch
up
with
the
futures
markets
.

When
the
Merc
imposed
its
first
halt
in
the
S&P
500
futures
contract
after
the
12-point
drop
,
the
stock
index
on
which
the
contract
is
based
went
down
from
eight
points
to
13
points
,
roughly
in
line
with
the
futures
contract
.

But
conflicting
steps
by
some
Chicago
exchanges
caused
consternation
among
traders
.

Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
officials
,
for
instance
,
halted
trading
in
their
S&P
100-stock
index
option
contract
,
as
expected
,
shortly
after
the
Merc
imposed
its
initial
trading
halt
.

The
CBOE
decided
not
to
reopen
the
nation
's
largest
stock-index
option
market
after
the
S&P
500
index
contract
reopened
and
halted
again
a
short
time
later
.

The
CBOE
said
in
a
statement
that
``
the
interests
of
fair
and
orderly
markets
would
n't
be
served
by
a
resumption
of
trading
.

''
But
some
options
traders
said
they
were
furious
that
they
had
been
denied
a
chance
to
trade
while
other
markets
were
open
.

The
CBOE
action
also
may
have
driven
prices
lower
in
the
Chicago
Merc
's
huge
S&P
500
index
futures
pit
,
traders
said
.

As
much
as
25
%
of
the
volume
in
S&P
500
futures
on
most
days
comes
from
CBOE
traders
hedging
their
risks
in
the
options
markets
.

With
their
own
market
closed
late
Friday
,
some
options
traders
deluged
the
S&P
500
futures
pit
with
sell
orders
to
hedge
their
frozen
options
positions
,
traders
said
.

As
a
result
,
one
of
the
largest
options-trading
firms
in
the
country
offered
to
sell
1,000
S&P
500
contracts
at
the
limit
of
30
index
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
,
an
S&P
500
futures
trader
said
.

That
offer
and
others
like
it
killed
any
chance
of
a
late
rally
and
drove
down
stock-index
futures
prices
to
the
daily
limit
,
the
trader
added
.

With
the
Chicago
markets
closed
,
traders
were
left
with
no
choice
but
to
``
bang
the
bids
{
sell
stocks
}
in
New
York
,
''
Mr.
Tabak
said
.

The
Major
Market
Index
futures
contract
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
,
traded
much
less
actively
,
touched
its
daily
limit
of
50
points
below
the
previous
day
's
close
several
times
Friday
,
but
bounced
back
slightly
and
never
halted
trading
.

To
provide
an
added
cash
cushion
to
compensate
for
the
increased
price
volatility
in
their
markets
,
the
Chicago
Merc
required
traders
to
increase
the
margin
,
or
amount
of
cash
they
put
up
to
trade
S&P
500
contracts
,
by
one-third
to
$
12,000
a
contract
from
$
9,000
,
effective
this
morning
.

The
Board
of
Trade
doubled
margin
requirements
for
the
Major
Market
Index
futures
to
$
8,000
a
contract
.

Officials
of
the
exchanges
said
they
communicated
well
with
each
other
and
with
government
regulators
during
Fri
day
's
sell-off
,
compared
with
the
sense
of
chaos
that
prevailed
at
times
on
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
.

But
while
top
offi
cials
are
talking
,
the
exchange
's
clearing
arms
are
still
largely
in
the
dark
about
the
financial
risks
their
members
may
be
exposed
to
in
other
markets
.

The
Chicago
Merc
has
begun
limited
cross-margining
of
stock-index
futures
accounts
with
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
processes
all
options
trades
for
U.S.
exchanges
.

But
for
the
most
part
,
stock
,
options
and
futures
markets
still
each
have
different
clearing
and
margin
systems
.

That
means
that
brokers
and
institutions
trading
on
several
exchanges
face
different
cash
requirements
on
each
,
making
it
extremely
difficult
during
a
crisis
for
an
exchange
to
ascertain
a
firm
's
overall
,
or
net
,
financial
position
.

Just
such
a
cash
squeeze
two
years
ago
,
at
a
leading
Wall
Street
firm
that
was
facing
duplicate
margin
calls
for
futures
and
options
positions
,
led
several
studies
of
the
markets
to
call
for
the
coordinated
margining
of
positions
in
different
markets
.

Take
$
10
out
of
your
wallet
.

That
's
how
much
the
collapse
of
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
will
cost
you
and
every
other
American
.

Liquidating
the
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
thrift
will
drain
the
federal
deposit
insurance
fund
by
more
than
$
2.5
billion
,
making
it
the
largest
thrift
failure
in
history
.

Now
,
finally
,
there
may
be
an
investigation
to
explore
how
five
senatorial
shills
helped
perpetuate
this
fiscal
black
hole
.

Back
in
June
,
we
recounted
how
five
U.S.
Senators
--
Alan
Cranston
of
California
,
Dennis
DeConcini
and
John
McCain
of
Arizona
,
John
Glenn
of
Ohio
and
Donald
Riegle
of
Michigan
--
intervened
with
regulators
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
,
whose
risk-fraught
loans
were
more
worthy
of
a
casino
than
a
federally
insured
thrift
.

Last
Friday
,
Common
Cause
,
a
political-reform
lobby
,
asked
for
a
Senate
Ethics
Committee
probe
of
the
five
Senators
.

It
wants
both
an
outside
counsel
to
conduct
the
probe
and
a
parallel
Justice
Department
investigation
,
things
it
has
not
initially
asked
for
in
previous
ethics
cases
.

Perhaps
Common
Cause
has
come
to
recognize
that
Congress
is
generally
incapable
of
investigating
itself
.

Charles
Keating
Jr.
,
the
chairman
of
American
Continental
,
Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
needed
the
Senators
'
help
in
his
running
battle
with
federal
regulators
.

He
admits
he
made
large
contributions
to
each
of
them
so
they
would
``
take
up
my
cause
.

''
In
one
case
,
57
Keating
executives
gave
$
66,100
to
Senator
Riegle
at
the
same
March
1987
fund-raiser
.

Mr.
Riegle
later
returned
the
money
.

In
April
1987
,
the
Senators
,
,
absent
Mr.
Riegle
,
asked
to
meet
with
Ed
Gray
,
then
head
of
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
Board
,
and
according
to
Mr.
Gray
,
unsuccessfully
pressed
him
to
drop
a
key
regulation
detrimental
to
Lincoln
--
``
a
clear
subversion
of
the
regulatory
process
.

''
Senator
McCain
now
calls
the
meeting
``
improper
''
and
after
several
previous
denials
,
Senator
Cranston
now
admits
the
regulation
probably
came
up
.

Days
later
,
the
four
senators
--
joined
by
Mr.
Riegle
--
met
with
other
regulators
to
press
Lincoln
's
case
.

Senators
Glenn
,
Riegle
and
McCain
apparently
stopped
doing
favors
for
Mr.
Keating
after
that
,
but
Senators
Cranston
and
DeConcini
persisted
,
intervening
on
behalf
of
Lincoln
until
just
before
its
closure
this
year
.

It
now
turns
out
that
at
least
four
of
the
five
Senators
may
have
been
indebted
to
Mr.
Keating
far
beyond
mere
campaign
contributions
:
--
The
Arizona
Republic
reports
that
two
of
Senator
DeConcini
's
top
aides
received
more
than
$
50
million
in
real-estate
loans
from
Lincoln
.

--
Senator
McCain
recently
reimbursed
Mr.
Keating
for
$
13,400
in
previously
unreported
airplane
trips
,
and
revealed
that
his
wife
and
father-in-law
invested
$
359,100
in
a
Keating
shopping-center
partnership
in
1986
.

--
Senator
Cranston
solicited
$
850,000
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
for
three
``
nonpartisan
''
voter-registration
groups
,
which
some
former
employees
now
say
were
fronts
for
the
Democratic
Party
.

--
Senator
Glenn
solicited
$
200,000
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
for
a
political
committee
he
controlled
that
paid
him
to
travel
around
the
country
.

Some
$
43,000
was
used
for
the
Glenn
Senate
campaign
--
a
possible
violation
of
federal
election
law
.

The
lack
of
attention
to
the
Keating
drama
is
astonishing
in
light
of
the
magnitude
of
the
savings-and-loan
disaster
.

The
S&L
bailout
promises
to
cost
the
taxpayers
some
$
200
billion
,
with
Lincoln
accounting
for
$
2.5
billion
alone
.

By
contrast
,
the
extensively
covered
HUD
political
scandals
may
cost
the
taxpayers
$
2.0
billion
,
the
centerpiece
being
a
$
0.0003
billion
check
to
James
Watt
,
the
legality
of
which
seems
to
be
uncontested
.

Similarly
,
the
spate
of
dubious
prosecutions
in
finance
obscures
the
seriousness
of
the
allegations
against
Mr.
Keating
and
his
associates
.

This
is
not
a
matter
of
whispering
``
bunny
.

''
The
160-page
civil
suit
filed
against
Mr.
Keating
last
month
by
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
the
vehicle
for
the
S&L
bailout
,
traces
a
clear
thread
.

Money
was
taken
into
Lincoln
,
for
example
by
selling
$
250
million
in
uninsured
debentures
near
retirement
communities
,
and
allegedly
taken
out
of
the
parent
company
by
insiders
,
for
example
by
the
sale
of
their
personal
stock
to
the
company
's
employee
stock
ownership
plan
.

The
case
remains
to
be
tested
in
court
,
of
course
,
but
if
the
allegations
hold
up
the
Senators
were
defending
a
classic
scam
.

Common
Cause
is
n't
the
only
body
that
thinks
the
Keating
Five
's
interventions
deserve
scrutiny
.

The
House
Banking
Committee
has
voted
to
subpoena
Mr.
Keating
and
top
federal
regulators
to
testify
about
Lincoln
.

The
hearings
begin
tomorrow
,
and
will
focus
on
why
thrift
regulator
M.
Danny
Wall
,
a
former
Senate
staffer
,
overruled
staff
recommendations
to
close
Lincoln
and
transferred
regulatory
oversight
of
Lincoln
to
Washington
.

Between
April
,
1987
,
when
the
five
senators
intervened
,
and
April
,
1988
,
when
Lincoln
was
finally
closed
,
the
losses
to
taxpayers
grew
by
some
$
1.5
billion
.

It
was
Common
Cause
's
demand
last
year
for
a
House
Ethics
Committee
probe
of
Speaker
Jim
Wright
that
prompted
the
committee
to
hire
Richard
Phelan
as
an
outside
counsel
.

Mr.
Phelan
found
that
Mr.
Wright
had
improperly
intervened
with
federal
regulators
on
behalf
of
S&Ls
,
but
the
Ethics
Committee
disagreed
,
saying
such
actions
were
an
integral
part
of
a
Member
's
job
and
it
could
not
second-guess
``
the
technique
and
personality
of
the
legislator
.

''
If
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
chooses
to
investigate
,
it
will
be
interesting
to
see
if
it
reaches
the
same
conclusion
in
the
case
of
the
five
Senators
.

No
,
it
was
n't
Black
Monday
.

But
while
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
did
n't
fall
apart
Friday
as
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plunged
190.58
points
--
most
of
it
in
the
final
hour
--
it
barely
managed
to
stay
this
side
of
chaos
.

Some
``
circuit
breakers
''
installed
after
the
October
1987
crash
failed
their
first
test
,
traders
say
,
unable
to
cool
the
selling
panic
in
both
stocks
and
futures
.

The
49
stock
specialist
firms
on
the
Big
Board
floor
--
the
buyers
and
sellers
of
last
resort
who
were
criticized
after
the
1987
crash
--
once
again
could
n't
handle
the
selling
pressure
.

Big
investment
banks
refused
to
step
up
to
the
plate
to
support
the
beleaguered
floor
traders
by
buying
big
blocks
of
stock
,
traders
say
.

Heavy
selling
of
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
in
Chicago
relentlessly
beat
stocks
downward
.

Seven
Big
Board
stocks
--
UAL
,
AMR
,
BankAmerica
,
Walt
Disney
,
Capital
,
Philip
Morris
and
Pacific
Telesis
Group
--
stopped
trading
and
never
resumed
.

The
finger-pointing
has
already
begun
.

``
The
equity
market
was
illiquid
.

Once
again
{
the
specialists
}
were
not
able
to
handle
the
imbalances
on
the
floor
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
''
said
Christopher
Pedersen
,
senior
vice
president
at
Twenty-First
Securities
Corp
.

Countered
James
Maguire
,
chairman
of
specialists
Henderson
Brothers
Inc.
:
``
It
is
easy
to
say
the
specialist
is
n't
doing
his
job
.

When
the
dollar
is
in
a
free-fall
,
even
central
banks
ca
n't
stop
it
.

Speculators
are
calling
for
a
degree
of
liquidity
that
is
not
there
in
the
market
.

''
Many
money
managers
and
some
traders
had
already
left
their
offices
early
Friday
afternoon
on
a
warm
autumn
day
--
because
the
stock
market
was
so
quiet
.

Then
in
a
lightning
plunge
,
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
in
barely
an
hour
surrendered
about
a
third
of
their
gains
this
year
,
chalking
up
a
190.58-point
,
or
6.9
%
,
loss
on
the
day
in
gargantuan
trading
volume
.

Final-hour
trading
accelerated
to
108.1
million
shares
,
a
record
for
the
Big
Board
.

At
the
end
of
the
day
,
251.2
million
shares
were
traded
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrials
closed
at
2569.26
.

The
Dow
's
decline
was
second
in
point
terms
only
to
the
508-point
Black
Monday
crash
that
occurred
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

In
percentage
terms
,
however
,
the
Dow
's
dive
was
the
12th-worst
ever
and
the
sharpest
since
the
market
fell
156.83
,
or
8
%
,
a
week
after
Black
Monday
.

The
Dow
fell
22.6
%
on
Black
Monday
.

Shares
of
UAL
,
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
,
were
extremely
active
all
day
Friday
,
reacting
to
news
and
rumors
about
the
proposed
$
6.79
billion
buy-out
of
the
airline
by
an
employee-management
group
.

Wall
Street
's
takeover-stock
speculators
,
or
``
risk
arbitragers
,
''
had
placed
unusually
large
bets
that
a
takeover
would
succeed
and
UAL
stock
would
rise
.

At
2:43
p.m.
EDT
,
came
the
sickening
news
:
The
Big
Board
was
halting
trading
in
UAL
,
``
pending
news
.

''
On
the
exchange
floor
,
``
as
soon
as
UAL
stopped
trading
,
we
braced
for
a
panic
,
''
said
one
top
floor
trader
.

Several
traders
could
be
seen
shaking
their
heads
when
the
news
flashed
.

For
weeks
,
the
market
had
been
nervous
about
takeovers
,
after
Campeau
Corp.
's
cash
crunch
spurred
concern
about
the
prospects
for
future
highly
leveraged
takeovers
.

And
10
minutes
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
came
news
that
the
UAL
group
could
n't
get
financing
for
its
bid
.

At
this
point
,
the
Dow
was
down
about
35
points
.

The
market
crumbled
.

Arbitragers
could
n't
dump
their
UAL
stock
--
but
they
rid
themselves
of
nearly
every
``
rumor
''
stock
they
had
.

For
example
,
their
selling
caused
trading
halts
to
be
declared
in
USAir
Group
,
which
closed
down
3
to
41
,
Delta
Air
Lines
,
which
fell
7
to
69
,
and
Philips
Industries
,
which
sank
3
to
21
.

These
stocks
eventually
reopened
.

But
as
panic
spread
,
speculators
began
to
sell
blue-chip
stocks
such
as
Philip
Morris
and
International
Business
Machines
to
offset
their
losses
.

When
trading
was
halted
in
Philip
Morris
,
the
stock
was
trading
at
41
,
down
3
,
while
IBM
closed
5
lower
at
102
.

Selling
snowballed
because
of
waves
of
automatic
``
stop-loss
''
orders
,
which
are
triggered
by
computer
when
prices
fall
to
certain
levels
.

Most
of
the
stock
selling
pressure
came
from
Wall
Street
professionals
,
including
computer-guided
program
traders
.

Traders
said
most
of
their
major
institutional
investors
,
on
the
other
hand
,
sat
tight
.

Now
,
at
3:07
,
one
of
the
market
's
post-crash
``
reforms
''
took
hold
as
the
S&P
500
futures
contract
had
plunged
12
points
,
equivalent
to
around
a
100-point
drop
in
the
Dow
industrials
.

Under
an
agreement
signed
by
the
Big
Board
and
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
,
trading
was
temporarily
halted
in
Chicago
.

After
the
trading
halt
in
the
S&P
500
pit
in
Chicago
,
waves
of
selling
continued
to
hit
stocks
themselves
on
the
Big
Board
,
and
specialists
continued
to
notch
prices
down
.

As
a
result
,
the
link
between
the
futures
and
stock
markets
ripped
apart
.

Without
the
guidepost
of
stock-index
futures
--
the
barometer
of
where
traders
think
the
overall
stock
market
is
headed
--
many
traders
were
afraid
to
trust
stock
prices
quoted
on
the
Big
Board
.

The
futures
halt
was
even
assailed
by
Big
Board
floor
traders
.

``
It
screwed
things
up
,
''
said
one
major
specialist
.

This
confusion
effectively
halted
one
form
of
program
trading
,
stock
index
arbitrage
,
that
closely
links
the
futures
and
stock
markets
,
and
has
been
blamed
by
some
for
the
market
's
big
swings
.

(
In
a
stock-index
arbitrage
sell
program
,
traders
buy
or
sell
big
baskets
of
stocks
and
offset
the
trade
in
futures
to
lock
in
a
price
difference
.

)
``
When
the
airline
information
came
through
,
it
cracked
every
model
we
had
for
the
marketplace
,
''
said
a
managing
director
at
one
of
the
largest
program-trading
firms
.

``
We
did
n't
even
get
a
chance
to
do
the
programs
we
wanted
to
do
.

''
But
stocks
kept
falling
.

The
Dow
industrials
were
down
55
points
at
3
p.m.
before
the
futures-trading
halt
.

At
3:30
p.m.
,
at
the
end
of
the
``
cooling
off
''
period
,
the
average
was
down
114.76
points
.

Meanwhile
,
during
the
the
S&P
trading
halt
,
S&P
futures
sell
orders
began
piling
up
,
while
stocks
in
New
York
kept
falling
sharply
.

Big
Board
Chairman
John
J.
Phelan
said
yesterday
the
circuit
breaker
``
worked
well
mechanically
.

I
just
think
it
's
nonproductive
at
this
point
to
get
into
a
debate
if
index
arbitrage
would
have
helped
or
hurt
things
.

''
Under
another
post-crash
system
,
Big
Board
President
Richard
Grasso
(
Mr.
Phelan
was
flying
to
Bangkok
as
the
market
was
falling
)
was
talking
on
an
``
inter-exchange
hot
line
''
to
the
other
exchanges
,
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
and
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
.

He
camped
out
at
a
high-tech
nerve
center
on
the
floor
of
the
Big
Board
,
where
he
could
watch
updates
on
prices
and
pending
stock
orders
.

At
about
3:30
p.m.
EDT
,
S&P
futures
resumed
trading
,
and
for
a
brief
time
the
futures
and
stock
markets
started
to
come
back
in
line
.

Buyers
stepped
in
to
the
futures
pit
.

But
the
build-up
of
S&P
futures
sell
orders
weighed
on
the
market
,
and
the
link
with
stocks
began
to
fray
again
.

At
about
3:45
,
the
S&P
market
careened
to
still
another
limit
,
of
30
points
down
,
and
trading
was
locked
again
.

Futures
traders
say
the
S&P
was
signaling
that
the
Dow
could
fall
as
much
as
200
points
.

During
this
time
,
small
investors
began
ringing
their
brokers
,
wondering
whether
another
crash
had
begun
.

At
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
,
which
is
trying
to
cater
to
small
investors
,
some
demoralized
brokers
thought
this
would
be
the
final
confidence-crusher
.

That
's
when
George
L.
Ball
,
chairman
of
the
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
unit
,
took
to
the
internal
intercom
system
to
declare
that
the
plunge
was
only
``
mechanical
.

''
``
I
have
a
hunch
that
this
particular
decline
today
is
something
`
more
ado
about
less
.

'
It
would
be
my
inclination
to
advise
clients
not
to
sell
,
to
look
for
an
opportunity
to
buy
,
''
Mr.
Ball
told
the
brokers
.

At
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
,
the
nation
's
biggest
brokerage
firm
,
a
news
release
was
prepared
headlined
``
Merrill
Lynch
Comments
on
Market
Drop
.

''
The
release
cautioned
that
``
there
are
significant
differences
between
the
current
environment
and
that
of
October
1987
''
and
that
there
are
still
``
attractive
investment
opportunities
''
in
the
stock
market
.

However
,
Jeffrey
B.
Lane
,
president
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
,
said
that
Friday
's
plunge
is
``
going
to
set
back
''
relations
with
customers
,
``
because
it
reinforces
the
concern
of
volatility
.

And
I
think
a
lot
of
people
will
harp
on
program
trading
.

It
's
going
to
bring
the
debate
right
back
to
the
forefront
.

''
As
the
Dow
average
ground
to
its
final
190.58
loss
Friday
,
the
S&P
pit
stayed
locked
at
its
30-point
trading
limit
.

Jeffrey
Yass
of
program
trader
Susquehanna
Investment
Group
said
2,000
S&P
contracts
were
for
sale
on
the
close
,
the
equivalent
of
$
330
million
in
stock
.

But
there
were
no
buyers
.

While
Friday
's
debacle
involved
mainly
professional
traders
rather
than
investors
,
it
left
the
market
vulnerable
to
continued
selling
this
morning
,
traders
said
.

Stock-index
futures
contracts
settled
at
much
lower
prices
than
indexes
of
the
stock
market
itself
.

At
those
levels
,
stocks
are
set
up
to
be
hammered
by
index
arbitragers
,
who
lock
in
profits
by
buying
futures
when
futures
prices
fall

The
de-linkage

Friday
will
undoubtedly
cause
renewed
debate
about
whether
Wall

is
properly
prepared

another

situation

The

Mr.

said
,
``

''
But
the

will
``
look
at

Obviously
we
'll
take
a
close
look
at
any
situation
in
which
we
think
the
dealer-community
obligations
were
n't
met
,

he
said

George
Morton
San
Diego
Ports
of
Call
Inc.
reached
agreements
to
sell
its
remaining
seven
aircraft
to
buyers
that
were
n't
disclosed
.

The
agreements
bring
to
a
total
of
nine
the
number
of
planes
the
travel
company
has
sold
this
year
as
part
of
a
restructuring
.

The
company
said
a
portion
of
the
$
32
million
realized
from
the
sales
will
be
used
to
repay
its
bank
debt
and
other
obligations
resulting
from
the
currently
suspended
air-charter
operations
.

Earlier
the
company
announced
it
would
sell
its
aging
fleet
of
Boeing
Co.
707s
because
of
increasing
maintenance
costs
.

A
consortium
of
private
investors
operating
as
LJH
Funding
Co.
said
it
has
made
a
$
409
million
cash
bid
for
most
of
L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
's
real-estate
and
shopping-center
holdings
.

The
$
409
million
bid
includes
the
assumption
of
an
estimated
$
300
million
in
secured
liabilities
on
those
properties
,
according
to
those
making
the
bid
.

The
group
is
led
by
Jay
Shidler
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Shidler
Investment
Corp.
in
Honolulu
,
and
A.
Boyd
Simpson
,
chief
executive
of
the
Atlanta-based
Simpson
Organization
Inc
.

Mr.
Shidler
's
company
specializes
in
commercial
real-estate
investment
and
claims
to
have
$
1
billion
in
assets
;
Mr.
Simpson
is
a
developer
and
a
former
senior
executive
of
L.J.
Hooker
.

``
The
assets
are
good
,
but
they
require
more
money
and
management
''
than
can
be
provided
in
L.J.
Hooker
's
current
situation
,
said
Mr.
Simpson
in
an
interview
.

``
Hooker
's
philosophy
was
to
build
and
sell
.

We
want
to
build
and
hold

L.J.
Hooker
,
based
in
Atlanta
,
is
operating
with
protection
from
its
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Code
.

Its
parent
company
,
Hooker
Corp.
of
Sydney
,
Australia
,
is
currently
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
provisional
liquidator
.

Sanford
Sigoloff
,
chief
executive
of
L.J.
Hooker
,
said
yesterday
in
a
statement
that
he
has
not
yet
seen
the
bid
but
that
he
would
review
it
and
bring
it
to
the
attention
of
the
creditors
committee
.

The
$
409
million
bid
is
estimated
by
Mr.
Simpson
as
representing
75
%
of
the
value
of
all
Hooker
real-estate
holdings
in
the
U.S
.

Not
included
in
the
bid
are
Bonwit
Teller
or
B.
Altman
&
Co.
,
L.J.
Hooker
's
department-store
chains
.

The
offer
covers
the
massive
1.8
million-square-foot
Forest
Fair
Mall
in
Cincinnati
,
the
800,000
square-foot
Richland
Fashion
Mall
in
Columbia
,
S.C.
,
and
the
700,000
square-foot
Thornton
Town
Center
mall
in
Thornton
,
Colo
.

The
Thornton
mall
opened
Sept.
19
with
a
Bigg
's
hypermarket
as
its
anchor
;
the
Columbia
mall
is
expected
to
open
Nov.
15
.

Other
Hooker
properties
included
are
a
20-story
office
tower
in
midtown
Atlanta
,
expected
to
be
completed
next
February
;
vacant
land
sites
in
Florida
and
Ohio
;
L.J.
Hooker
International
,
the
commercial
real-estate
brokerage
company
that
once
did
business
as
Merrill
Lynch
Commercial
Real
Estate
,
plus
other
shopping
centers
.

The
consortium
was
put
together
by
Hoare
Govett
,
the
London-based
investment
banking
company
that
is
a
subsidiary
of
Security
Pacific
Corp
.

``
We
do
n't
anticipate
any
problems
in
raising
the
funding
for
the
bid
,
''
said
Allan
Campbell
,
the
head
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
at
Hoare
Govett
,
in
an
interview
.

Hoare
Govett
is
acting
as
the
consortium
's
investment
bankers
.

According
to
people
familiar
with
the
consortium
,
the
bid
was
code-named
Project
Klute
,
a
reference
to
the
film
``
Klute
''
in
which
a
prostitute
played
by
actress
Jane
Fonda
is
saved
from
a
psychotic
businessman
by
a
police
officer
named
John
Klute
.

L.J.
Hooker
was
a
small
home-building
company
based
in
Atlanta
in
1979
when
Mr.
Simpson
was
hired
to
push
it
into
commercial
development
.

The
company
grew
modestly
until
1986
,
when
a
majority
position
in
Hooker
Corp.
was
acquired
by
Australian
developer
George
Herscu
,
currently
Hooker
's
chairman
.

Mr.
Herscu
proceeded
to
launch
an
ambitious
,
but
ill-fated
,
$
1
billion
acquisition
binge
that
included
Bonwit
Teller
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
,
as
well
as
majority
positions
in
Merksamer
Jewelers
,
a
Sacramento
chain
;
Sakowitz
Inc.
,
the
Houston-based
retailer
,
and
Parisian
Inc.
,
the
Southeast
department-store
chain
.

Eventually
Mr.
Simpson
and
Mr.
Herscu
had
a
falling
out
over
the
direction
of
the
company
,
and
Mr.
Simpson
said
he
resigned
in
1988
.

Since
then
,
Hooker
Corp.
has
sold
its
interest
in
the
Parisian
chain
back
to
Parisian
's
management
and
is
currently
attempting
to
sell
the
B.
Altman
&
Co.
chain
.

In
addition
,
Robert
Sakowitz
,
chief
executive
of
the
Sakowitz
chain
,
is
seeking
funds
to
buy
out
the
Hooker
interest
in
his
company
.

The
Merksamer
chain
is
currently
being
offered
for
sale
by
First
Boston
Corp
.

Reached
in
Honolulu
,
Mr.
Shidler
said
that
he
believes
the
various
Hooker
malls
can
become
profitable
with
new
management
.

``
These
are
n't
mature
assets
,
but
they
have
the
potential
to
be
so
,
''
said
Mr.
Shidler
.

``
Managed
properly
,
and
with
a
long-term
outlook
,
these
can
become
investment-grade
quality
properties
.

As
small
investors
peppered
their
mutual
funds
with
phone
calls
over
the
weekend
,
big
fund
managers
said
they
have
a
strong
defense
against
any
wave
of
withdrawals
:
cash
.

Unlike
the
weekend
before
Black
Monday
,
the
funds
were
n't
swamped
with
heavy
withdrawal
requests
.

And
many
fund
managers
have
built
up
cash
levels
and
say
they
will
be
buying
stock
this
week
.

At
Fidelity
Investments
,
the
nation
's
largest
fund
company
,
telephone
volume
was
up
sharply
,
but
it
was
still
at
just
half
the
level
of
the
weekend
preceding
Black
Monday
in
1987
.

The
Boston
firm
said
stock-fund
redemptions
were
running
at
less
than
one-third
the
level
two
years
ago
.

As
of
yesterday
afternoon
,
the
redemptions
represented
less
than
15
%
of
the
total
cash
position
of
about
$
2
billion
of
Fidelity
's
stock
funds
.

``
Two
years
ago
there
were
massive
redemption
levels
over
the
weekend
and
a
lot
of
fear
around
,
''
said
C.
Bruce
Johnstone
,
who
runs
Fidelity
Investments
'
$
5
billion
Equity-Income
Fund
.

``
This
feels
more
like
a
one-shot
deal
.

People
are
n't
panicking
.

''
The
test
may
come
today
.

Friday
's
stock
market
sell-off
came
too
late
for
many
investors
to
act
.

Some
shareholders
have
held
off
until
today
because
any
fund
exchanges
made
after
Friday
's
close
would
take
place
at
today
's
closing
prices
.

Stock
fund
redemptions
during
the
1987
debacle
did
n't
begin
to
snowball
until
after
the
market
opened
on
Black
Monday
.

But
fund
managers
say
they
're
ready
.

Many
have
raised
cash
levels
,
which
act
as
a
buffer
against
steep
market
declines
.

Mario
Gabelli
,
for
instance
,
holds
cash
positions
well
above
20
%
in
several
of
his
funds
.

Windsor
Fund
's
John
Neff
and
Mutual
Series
'
Michael
Price
said
they
had
raised
their
cash
levels
to
more
than
20
%
and
30
%
,
respectively
,
this
year
.

Even
Peter
Lynch
,
manager
of
Fidelity
's
$
12.7
billion
Magellan
Fund
,
the
nation
's
largest
stock
fund
,
built
up
cash
to
7
%
or
$
850
million
.

One
reason
is
that
after
two
years
of
monthly
net
redemptions
,
the
fund
posted
net
inflows
of
money
from
investors
in
August
and
September
.

``
I
've
let
the
money
build
up
,
''
Mr.
Lynch
said
,
who
added
that
he
has
had
trouble
finding
stocks
he
likes
.

Not
all
funds
have
raised
cash
levels
,
of
course
.

As
a
group
,
stock
funds
held
10.2
%
of
assets
in
cash
as
of
August
,
the
latest
figures
available
from
the
Investment
Company
Institute
.

That
was
modestly
higher
than
the
8.8
%
and
9.2
%
levels
in
August
and
September
of
1987
.

Also
,
persistent
redemptions
would
force
some
fund
managers
to
dump
stocks
to
raise
cash
.

But
a
strong
level
of
investor
withdrawals
is
much
more
unlikely
this
time
around
,
fund
managers
said
.

A
major
reason
is
that
investors
already
have
sharply
scaled
back
their
purchases
of
stock
funds
since
Black
Monday
.

Stock-fund
sales
have
rebounded
in
recent
months
,
but
monthly
net
purchases
are
still
running
at
less
than
half
1987
levels
.

``
There
's
not
nearly
as
much
froth
,
''
said
John
Bogle
,
chairman
of
Vanguard
Group
Inc.
,
a
big
Valley
Forge
,
Pa.
,
fund
company
.

Many
fund
managers
argue
that
now
's
the
time
to
buy
.

Vincent
Bajakian
,
manager
of
the
$
1.8
billion
Wellington
Fund
,
added
to
his
positions
in
Bristol-Myers
Squibb
,
Woolworth
and
Dun
&
Bradstreet
Friday
.

And
today
he
'll
be
looking
to
buy
drug
stocks
like
Eli
Lilly
,
Pfizer
and
American
Home
Products
whose
dividend
yields
have
been
bolstered
by
stock
declines
.

Fidelity
's
Mr.
Lynch
,
for
his
part
,
snapped
up
Southern
Co.
shares
Friday
after
the
stock
got
hammered
.

If
the
market
drops
further
today
,
he
said
he
'll
be
buying
blue
chips
such
as
Bristol-Myers
and
Kellogg
.

``
If
they
croak
stocks
like
that
,
''
he
said
,
it
presents
an
opportunity
that
is
``
the
kind
of
thing
you
dream
about
.

''
Major
mutual-fund
groups
said
phone
calls
were
arriving
at
twice
the
normal
weekend
pace
yesterday
.

But
most
investors
were
seeking
share
prices
and
other
information
.

Trading
volume
was
only
modestly
higher
than
normal
.

Still
,
fund
groups
are
n't
taking
any
chances
.

They
hope
to
avoid
the
jammed
phone
lines
and
other
snags
that
infuriated
some
fund
investors
in
October
1987
.

Fidelity
on
Saturday
opened
its
54
walk-in
investor
centers
across
the
country
.

The
centers
normally
are
closed
through
the
weekend
.

In
addition
,
East
Coast
centers
will
open
at
7:30
EDT
this
morning
,
instead
of
the
normal
8:30
.

T.
Rowe
Price
Associates
Inc.
increased
its
staff
of
phone
representatives
to
handle
investor
requests
.

The
Baltimore-based
group
noted
that
some
investors
moved
money
from
stock
funds
to
money-market
funds
.

But
most
investors
seemed
to
be
``
in
an
information
mode
rather
than
in
a
transaction
mode
,
''
said
Steven
Norwitz
,
a
vice
president
.

And
Vanguard
,
among
other
groups
,
said
it
was
adding
more
phone
representatives
today
to
help
investors
get
through
.

In
an
unusual
move
,
several
funds
moved
to
calm
investors
with
recordings
on
their
toll-free
phone
lines
.

``
We
view
{
Friday
's
}
market
decline
as
offering
us
a
buying
opportunity
as
long-term
investors
,
''
a
recording
at
Gabelli
&
Co.
funds
said
over
the
weekend
.

The
Janus
Group
had
a
similar
recording
for
investors
.

Several
fund
managers
expect
a
rough
market
this
morning
before
prices
stabilize
.

Some
early
selling
is
likely
to
stem
from
investors
and
portfolio
managers
who
want
to
lock
in
this
year
's
fat
profits
.

Stock
funds
have
averaged
a
staggering
gain
of
25
%
through
September
,
according
to
Lipper
Analytical
Services
Inc
.

Elaine
Garzarelli
,
who
runs
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
's
$
335
million
Sector
Analysis
Portfolio
,
predicts
the
market
will
open
down
at
least
50
points
on
technical
factors
and
``
some
panic
selling
.

''
But
she
expects
prices
to
rebound
soon
and
is
telling
investors
she
expects
the
stock
market
wo
n't
decline
more
than
10
%
to
15
%
from
recent
highs
.

``
This
is
not
a
major
crash
,
''
she
said
.

Nevertheless
,
Ms.
Garzarelli
said
she
was
swamped
with
phone
calls
over
the
weekend
from
nervous
shareholders
.

``
Half
of
them
are
really
scared
and
want
to
sell
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
I
'm
trying
to
talk
them
out
of
it
.

''
She
added
,
``
If
they
all
were
bullish
,
I
'd
really
be
upset
.

''
The
backdrop
to
Friday
's
slide
was
markedly
different
from
that
of
the
October
1987
crash
,
fund
managers
argue
.

Two
years
ago
,
unlike
today
,
the
dollar
was
weak
,
interest
rates
were
rising
and
the
market
was
very
overvalued
,
they
say
.

``
From
the
investors
'
standpoint
,
institutions
and
individuals
learned
a
painful

Newport

said
it
expects
to
report
fiscal-first-quarter
earnings
of
between
15
cents
and
19

somewhat
below

The

added
that

Ripples
from
the
strike
by
55,000
Machinists
union
members
against
Boeing
Co.
reached
air
carriers
Friday
as
America
West
Airlines
announced
it
will
postpone
its
new
service
out
of
Houston
because
of
delays
in
receiving
aircraft
from
the
Seattle
jet
maker
.

Peter
Otradovec
,
vice
president
for
planning
at
the
Phoenix
,
Ariz.
,
carrier
,
said
in
an
interview
that
the
work
stoppage
at
Boeing
,
now
entering
its
13th
day
,
``
has
caused
some
turmoil
in
our
scheduling
''
and
that
more
than
500
passengers
who
were
booked
to
fly
out
of
Houston
on
America
West
would
now
be
put
on
other
airlines
.

Mr.
Otradovec
said
Boeing
told
America
West
that
the
757
it
was
supposed
to
get
this
Thursday
would
n't
be
delivered
until
Nov.
7
--
the
day
after
the
airline
had
been
planning
to
initiate
service
at
Houston
with
four
daily
flights
,
including
three
nonstops
to
Phoenix
and
one
nonstop
to
Las
Vegas
.

Now
,
those
routes
are
n't
expected
to
begin
until
Jan
.

Boeing
is
also
supposed
to
send
to
America
West
another
757
twin-engine
aircraft
as
well
as
a
737
by
year
's
end
.

Those
,
too
,
are
almost
certain
to
arrive
late
.

At
this
point
,
no
other
America
West
flights
--
including
its
new
service
at
San
Antonio
,
Texas
;
Newark
,
N.J.
;
and
Palmdale
,
Calif.
--
have
been
affected
by
the
delays
in
Boeing
deliveries
.

Nevertheless
,
the
company
's
reaction
underscores
the
domino
effect
that
a
huge
manufacturer
such
as
Boeing
can
have
on
other
parts
of
the
economy
.

It
also
is
sure
to
help
the
machinists
put
added
pressure
on
the
company
.

``
I
just
do
n't
feel
that
the
company
can
really
stand
or
would
want
a
prolonged
walkout
,
''
Tom
Baker
,
president
of
Machinists
'
District
751
,
said
in
an
interview
yesterday
.

``
I
do
n't
think
their
customers
would
like
it
very
much
.

''
America
West
,
though
,
is
a
smaller
airline
and
therefore
more
affected
by
the
delayed
delivery
of
a
single
plane
than
many
of
its
competitors
would
be
.

``
I
figure
that
American
and
United
probably
have
such
a
hard
time
counting
all
the
planes
in
their
fleets
,
they
might
not
miss
one
at
all
,
''
Mr.
Otradovec
said
.

Indeed
,
a
random
check
Friday
did
n't
seem
to
indicate
that
the
strike
was
having
much
of
an
effect
on
other
airline
operations
.

Southwest
Airlines
has
a
Boeing
737-300
set
for
delivery
at
the
end
of
this
month
and
expects
to
have
the
plane
on
time
.

``
It
's
so
close
to
completion
,
Boeing
's
told
us
there
wo
n't
be
a
problem
,
''
said
a
Southwest
spokesman
.

A
spokesman
for
AMR
Corp.
said
Boeing
has
assured
American
Airlines
it
will
deliver
a
757
on
time
later
this
month
.

American
is
preparing
to
take
delivery
of
another
757
in
early
December
and
20
more
next
year
and
is
n't
anticipating
any
changes
in
that
timetable
.

In
Seattle
,
a
Boeing
spokesman
explained
that
the
company
has
been
in
constant
communication
with
all
of
its
customers
and
that
it
was
impossible
to
predict
what
further
disruptions
might
be
triggered
by
the
strike
.

Meanwhile
,
supervisors
and
non-striking
employees
have
been
trying
to
finish
some
40
aircraft
--
mostly
747
and
767
jumbo
jets
at
the
company
's
Everett
,
Wash.
,
plant
--
that
were
all
but
completed
before
the
walkout
.

As
of
Friday
,
four
had
been
delivered
and
a
fifth
plane
,
a
747-400
,
was
supposed
to
be
flown
out
over
the
weekend
to
Air
China
.

No
date
has
yet
been
set
to
get
back
to
the
bargaining
table
.

``
We
want
to
make
sure
they
know
what
they
want
before
they
come
back
,
''
said
Doug
Hammond
,
the
federal
mediator
who
has
been
in
contact
with
both
sides
since
the
strike
began
.

The
investment
community
,
for
one
,
has
been
anticipating
a
speedy
resolution
.

Though
Boeing
's
stock
price
was
battered
along
with
the
rest
of
the
market
Friday
,
it
actually
has
risen
over
the
last
two
weeks
on
the
strength
of
new
orders
.

``
The
market
has
taken
two
views
:
that
the
labor
situation
will
get
settled
in
the
short
term
and
that
things
look
very
rosy
for
Boeing
in
the
long
term
,
''
said
Howard
Rubel
,
an
analyst
at
Cyrus
J.
Lawrence
Inc
.

Boeing
's
shares
fell
$
4
Friday
to
close
at
$
57.375
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

But
Mr.
Baker
said
he
thinks
the
earliest
a
pact
could
be
struck
would
be
the
end
of
this
month
,
hinting
that
the
company
and
union
may
resume
negotiations
as
early
as
this
week
.

Still
,
he
said
,
it
's
possible
that
the
strike
could
last
considerably
longer
.

``
I
would
n't
expect
an
immediate
resolution
to
anything
.

''
Last
week
,
Boeing
Chairman
Frank
Shrontz
sent
striking
workers
a
letter
,
saying
that
``
to
my
knowledge
,
Boeing
's
offer
represents
the
best
overall
three-year
contract
of
any
major
U.S.
industrial
firm
in
recent
history
.

''
But
Mr.
Baker
called
the
letter
--
and
the
company
's
offer
of
a
10
%
wage
increase
over
the
life
of
the
pact
,
plus
bonuses
--
``
very
weak
.

''
He
added
that
the
company
miscalculated
the
union
's
resolve
and
the
workers
'
disgust
with
being
forced
to
work
many
hours
overtime
.

In
separate
developments
:
--
Talks
have
broken
off
between
Machinists
representatives
at
Lockheed
Corp.
and
the
Calabasas
,
Calif.
,
aerospace
company
.

The
union
is
continuing
to
work
through
its
expired
contract
,
however
.

It
had
planned
a
strike
vote
for
next
Sunday
,
but
that
has
been
pushed
back
indefinitely
.

United

1069
,
which
represents
3,000
workers
at
Boeing
's

unit
in
Delaware
County
,
Pa.
,
said
it
agreed
to
extend
its
contract
on
a
day-by-day
basis
,
with
a
10-day
notification
to
cancel
,
while
it
continues
bargaining
.

The
accord
expired
yesterday
.

--
And
Boeing
on
Friday
said
it
received
an
order
from
Martinair
Holland
for
four
model
767-300
wide-body
jetliners
valued
at
a
total
of
about
$
326
million
.

The
planes
,
long
range
versions
of
the
medium-haul
twin-jet
,
will
be
delivered
with

PW4060
engines
.

Pratt
&
Whitney
is
a
unit
of
United
Technologies
Inc
.

Martinair
Holland
is
based
in
Amsterdam
.

A
Boeing
spokeswoman
said
a
delivery
date
for
the
planes
is
still
being
worked
out
``
for
a
variety
of
reasons
,
but
not
because
of
the
strike

Atco
Ltd.
said
its
utilities
arm
is
considering
building
new
electric
power
plants
,
some
valued
at
more
than
one
billion
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
851
million
)
,
in
Great
Britain
and
elsewhere
.

C.S.
Richardson
,
Atco
's
senior
vice
president
,
finance
,
said
its
50.1%-owned
Canadian
Utilities
Ltd.
unit
is
reviewing
cogeneration
projects
in
eastern
Canada
,
and
conventional
electric
power
generating
plants
elsewhere
,
including
Britain
,
where
the
British
government
plans
to
allow
limited
competition
in
electrical
generation
from
private-sector
suppliers
as
part
of
its
privatization
program
.

``
The
projects
are
big
.

They
can
be
C$
1
billion
plus
,
''
Mr.
Richardson
said
.

``
But
we
would
n't
go
into
them
alone
,
''
and
Canadian
Utilities
'
equity
stake
would
be
small
,
he
said
.

``
Ideally
,
we
'd
like
to
be
the
operator
{
of
the
project
}
and
a
modest
equity
investor
.

Our
long
suit
is
our
proven
ability
to
operate

power
plants
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Richardson
would
n't
offer
specifics
regarding
Atco
's
proposed
British
project
,
but
he
said
it
would
compete
for
customers
with
two
huge
British
power
generating
companies
that
would
be
formed
under
the
country
's
plan
to
privatize
its
massive
water
and
electric
utilities
.

Britain
's
government
plans
to
raise
about
#
20
billion
(
$
31.05
billion
)
from
the
sale
of
most
of
its
giant
water
and
electric
utilities
,
beginning
next
month
.

The
planned
electric
utility
sale
,
scheduled
for
next
year
,
is
alone
expected
to
raise
#
13
billion
,
making
it
the
world
's
largest
public
offering
.

Under
terms
of
the
plan
,
independent
generators
would
be
able
to
compete
for
15
%
of
customers
until
1994
,
and
for
another
10
%
between
1994
and
1998
.

Canadian
Utilities
had
1988
revenue
of
C$
1.16
billion
,
mainly
from
its
natural
gas
and
electric
utility
businesses
in
Alberta
,
where
the
company
serves
about
800,000
customers
.

``
There
seems
to
be
a
move
around
the
world
to
deregulate
the
generation
of
electricity
,
''
Mr.
Richardson
said
,
and
Canadian
Utilities
hopes
to
capitalize
on
it
.

``
This
is
a
real
thrust
on
our
utility
side
,
''
he
said
,
adding
that
Canadian
Utilities
is
also
mulling
projects
in
underdeveloped
countries
,
though
he
would
be
specific
.

Canadian
Utilities
is
n't
alone
in
exploring
power
generation
opportunities
in

,
in

Kaufman

said
it
formed
a
$
53.4
million
limited
partnership
subsidiary
to
buy
land
in
California
suitable
for
residential
development
.

The
partnership
,
Kaufman

Land
Development
Venture
Limited
Partnership
,
is
a
50-50
joint
venture
with
a
trust
created

Beverly

,
Calif
.

Kaufman
&
Broad
,
a
home
building
company
,
declined
to
identify
the
institutional
investors
.

The
land
to
be
purchased
by
the
joint
venture
has
n't
yet
received
zoning
and
other
approvals
required
for
development
,
and
part
of
Kaufman
&
Broad
's
job
will
be
to
obtain
such
approvals
.

The
partnership
runs
the
risk
that
it
may
not
get
the
approvals
for
development
,
but
in
return
,
it
can
buy
land
at
wholesale
rather
than
retail
prices
,
which
can
result
in
sizable
savings
,
said
Bruce
Karatz
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Kaufman

Broad
.

``
There
are
really

developers
option
property
,
and
then
once
they
get
the
administrative
approvals
,
they
buy
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Karatz
,
adding
that
he
believes
the
joint
venture
is
the
first
of
its
kind
.

``
We
usually
operate
in
that
conservative
manner
.

''
By
setting
up
the
joint
venture
,
Kaufman
&
Broad
can
take
the
more
aggressive
approach
of
buying
raw
land
,
while
avoiding
the
negative
impacts
to
its
own
balance
sheet
,
Mr.
Karatz
said
.

The
company
is
putting
up
only
10
%
of
the
capital
,
although
it
is
responsible
for
providing
management
,
planning
and
processing
services
to
the
joint
venture
.

``
This
is
one
of
the
best
ways
to
assure

of
land
to
fuel
our
growth
at
a
minimum
risk
to
our
company

When
the
price
of
plastics
took
off

Quantum
Chemical

along
for
the
ride

The
timing
of
Quantum
's
chief
executive
officer
,
John
Hoyt
Stookey
,
appeared
to
be
nothing
less
than
inspired
,
because
he
had
just
increased
Quantum
's
reliance
on
plastics
.

The
company
outpaced
much
of
the
chemical
industry
as
annual
profit
grew
fivefold
in
two
years
.

Mr.
Stookey
said
of
the
boom
,
``
It
's
going
to
last
a
whole
lot
longer
than
anybody
thinks
.

''
But
now
prices
have
nose-dived
and
Quantum
's
profit
is
plummeting

Some
securities
analysts
are
looking
for
no
better
than
break-even
results
from
the

for

the
so-called
commodity
plastics
that
pervade
modern
life
.

Having
just
passed
through
one
of
the
most
profitable
periods
in
their
history
,
these
producers
now
see
their
prices
eroding
.

Pricing
cycles
,
to
be
sure
,
are
nothing
new
for
plastics
producers
.

And
the
financial
decline
of
some
looks
steep
only
in
comparison
with
the
heady
period
that
is
just
behind
them
.

``
We
were
all
wonderful
heroes
last
year
,
''
says
an
executive
at
one
of
Quantum
's
competitors
.

``
Now
we
're
at
the
bottom
of
the
heap
.

''
At
Quantum
,
which
is
based
in
New
York
,
the
trouble
is
magnified
by
the
company
's
heavy
dependence
on
plastics
.

Once
known
as
National
Distillers
&
Chemical
Corp.
,
the
company
exited
the
wine
and
spirits
business
and
plowed
more
of
its
resources
into
plastics
after
Mr.
Stookey
took
the
chief
executive
's
job
in
1986
.

Mr.
Stookey
,
59
years
old
,
declined
to
be
interviewed
for
this
article
,
but
he
has
consistently
argued
that
over
the
long
haul
--
across
both
the
peaks
and
the
troughs
of
the
plastics
market
--
Quantum
will
prosper
through
its
new
direction
.

Quantum
's
lot
is
mostly
tied
to
polyethylene
resin
,
used
to
make
garbage
bags
,
milk
jugs
,
housewares
,
toys
and
meat
packaging
,
among
other
items
.

In
the
U.S.
polyethylene
market
,
Quantum
has
claimed
the
largest
share
,
about
20
%
.

But
its
competitors
--
including
Dow
Chemical
Co.
,
Union
Carbide
Corp.
and
several
oil
giants
--
have
much
broader
business
interests
and
so
are
better
cushioned
against
price
swings
.

When
the
price
of
polyethylene
moves
a
mere
penny
a
pound
,
Quantum
's
annual
profit
fluctuates
by
about
85
cents
a
share
,
provided
no
other
variables
are
changing
.

In
recent
months
the
price
of
polyethylene
,
even
more
than
that
of
other
commodity
plastics
,
has
taken
a
dive
.

Benchmark
grades
,
which
still
sold
for
as
much
as
50
cents
a
pound
last
spring
,
have
skidded
to
between
35
cents
and
40
cents
.

Meanwhile
,
the
price
of
ethylene
,
the
chemical
building
block
of
polyethylene
,
has
n't
dropped
nearly
so
fast
.

That
discrepancy
hurts
Quantum
badly
,
because
its
own
plants
cover
only
about
half
of
its
ethylene
needs
.

By
many
accounts
,
an
early
hint
of
a
price
rout
in
the
making
came
at
the
start
of
this
year
.

China
,
which
had
been
putting
in
huge
orders
for
polyethylene
,
abruptly
halted
them
.

Calculating
that
excess
polyethylene
would
soon
be
sloshing
around
the
world
,
other
buyers
then
bet
that
prices
had
peaked
and
so
began
to
draw
down
inventories
rather
than
order
new
product
.

Kenneth
Mitchell
,
director
of
Dow
's
polyethylene
business
,
says
producers
were
surprised
to
learn
how
much
inventories
had
swelled
throughout
the
distribution
chain
as
prices
spiraled
up
.

``
People
were
even
hoarding
bags
,
''
he
says
.

Now
producers
hope
prices
have
hit
bottom
.

They
recently
announced
increases
of
a
few
cents
a
pound
to
take
effect
in
the
next
several
weeks
.

No
one
knows
,
however
,
whether
the
new
posted
prices
will
stick
once
producers
and
customers
start
to
haggle
.

One
doubter
is
George
Krug
,
a
chemical-industry
analyst
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co.
and
a
bear
on
plastics
stocks
.

Noting
others
'
estimates
of
when
price
increases
can
be
sustained
,
he
remarks
,
``
Some
say
October
.

Some
say
November
.

I
say
1992
.

''
He
argues
that
efforts
to
firm
up
prices
will
be
undermined
by
producers
'
plans
to
expand
production
capacity
.

A
quick
turnaround
is
crucial
to
Quantum
because
its
cash
requirements
remain
heavy
.

The
company
is
trying
to
carry
out
a
three-year
,
$
1.3
billion
plant-expansion
program
started
this
year
.

At
the
same
time
,
its
annual
payments
on
long-term
debt
will
more
than
double
from
a
year
ago
to
about
$
240
million
,
largely
because
of
debt
taken
on
to
pay
a
$
50-a-share
special
dividend
earlier
this
year
.

Quantum
described
the
payout
at
the
time
as
a
way
for
it
to
share
the
bonanza
with
its
holders
,
because
its
stock
price
was
n't
reflecting
the
huge
profit
increases
.

Some
analysts
saw
the
payment
as
an
effort
also
to
dispel
takeover
speculation
.

Whether
a
cash
crunch
might
eventually
force
the
company
to
cut
its
quarterly
dividend
,
raised
36
%
to
75
cents
a
share
only
a
year
ago
,
has
become
a
topic
of
intense
speculation
on
Wall
Street
since
Mr.
Stookey
deflected
dividend
questions
in
a
Sept.
29
meeting
with
analysts
.

Some
viewed
his
response
--
that
company
directors
review
the
dividend
regularly
--
as
nothing
more
than
the
standard
line
from
executives
.

But
others
came
away
thinking
he
had
given
something
less
than
his
usual
straight-from-the-shoulder
performance
.

In
any
case
,
on
the
day
of
the
meeting
,
Quantum
's
shares
slid
$
2.625
to
$
36.625
in
Big
Board
trading
.

On
top
of
everything
else
,
Quantum
confronts
a
disaster
at
its
plant
in
Morris
,
Ill
.

After
an
explosion
idled
the
plant
in
June
,
the
company
progressed
in
September
to
within
12
hours
of
completing
the
drawn-out
process
of
restarting
it
.

Then
a
second
explosion
occurred
.

Two
workers
died
and
six
remain
in
the
hospital
.

This
human
toll
adds
the
most
painful
dimension
yet
to
the
sudden
change
in
Quantum
's
fortunes
.

Until
this
year
,
the
company
had
been
steadily
lowering
its
accident
rate
and
picking
up
trade-group
safety
awards
.

A
prolonged
production
halt
at
the
plant
could
introduce
another
imponderable
into
Quantum
's
financial
future
.

When
a
plant
has
just
been
running
flat
out
to
meet
demand
,
calculating
lost
profit
and
thus
claims
under
business-interruption
insurance
is
straightforward
.

But
the
numbers
become
trickier
--
and
subject
to
dickering
between
insured
and
insurer
--
when
demand
is
shifting
.

``
You
say
you
could
have
sold
X
percent
of
this
product
and
Y
percent
of
that
,
''
recalls
Theodore
Semegran
,
an
analyst
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
who
went
through
this
exercise
during
his
former
career
as
a
chemical
engineer
.

``
And
then
you
still
have
to
negotiate
.

''
Quantum
hopes
the
Morris
plant
,
where
limited
production
got
under
way
last
week
,
will
resume
full
operation
by
year
's
end
.

The
plant
usually
accounts
for
20
%
to
25
%
of
Quantum
's
polyethylene
production
and
50
%
of
its
ethylene
production
.

Not
everything
looks
grim
for
Quantum
.

The
plant
expansion
should
strengthen
the
company
's
sway
in
the
polyethylene
business
,
where
market
share
is
often
taken
through
sheer
capacity
.

By
lifting
ethylene
production
,
the
expansion
will
also
lower
the
company
's
raw
material
costs
.

Quantum
is
also
tightening
its
grip
on
its
one
large
business
outside
chemicals
,
propane
marketing
.

Through
a
venture
with
its
investment
banker
,
First
Boston
Corp.
,
Quantum
completed
in
August
an
acquisition
of
Petrolane
Inc.
in
a
transaction
valued
at
$
1.18
billion
.

Petrolane
is
the
second-largest
propane
distributor
in
the
U.S
.

The
largest
,
Suburban
Propane
,
was
already
owned
by
Quantum
.

Still
,
Quantum
has
a
crisis
to
get
past
right
now
.

Some
analysts
speculate
the
weakening
stock
may
yet
attract
a
suitor
.

The
name
surfacing
in
rumors
is
British
Petroleum
Co.
,
which
is
looking
to
expand
its
polyethylene
business
in
the
U.S
.

Asked
about
a
bid
for
Quantum
,
a
BP
spokesman
says
,
``
We
pretty
much
have
a
policy
of
not
commenting
on
rumors
,
and
I
think
that
falls
in
that
category
.

''
RJR
Nabisco
Inc.
is
disbanding
its
division
responsible
for
buying
network
advertising
time
,
just
a
month
after
moving
11
of
the
group
's
14
employees
to
New
York
from
Atlanta
.

A
spokesman
for
the
New
York-based
food
and
tobacco
giant
,
taken
private
earlier
this
year
in
a
$
25
billion
leveraged
buy-out
by
Kohlberg
Kravis
Roberts
&
Co.
,
confirmed
that
it
is
shutting
down
the
RJR
Nabisco
Broadcast
unit
,
and
dismissing
its
14
employees
,
in
a
move
to
save
money
.

The
spokesman
said
RJR
is
discussing
its
network-buying
plans
with
its
two
main
advertising
firms
,
Katz
and
McCann
Erickson
.

``
We
found
with
the
size
of
our
media
purchases
that
an
ad
agency
could
do
just
as
good
a
job
at
significantly
lower
cost
,
''
said
the
spokesman
,
who
declined
to
specify
how
much
RJR
spends
on
network
television
time
.

An
executive
close
to
the
company
said
RJR
is
spending
about
$
140
million
on
network
television
time
this
year
,
down
from
roughly
$
200
million
last
year
.

The
spokesman
said
the
broadcast
unit
will
be
disbanded
Dec.
1
,
and
the
move
wo
n't
affect
RJR
's
print
,
radio
and
spot-television
buying
practices
.

The
broadcast
group
had
been
based
in
New
York
until
a
year
ago
,
when
RJR
's
previous
management
moved
it
to
Atlanta
,
the
company
's
headquarters
before
this
summer
.

One
employee
with
the
group
said
RJR
moved
11
employees
of
the
group
back
to
New
York
in
September
because
``
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
future
.

''
He
said
the
company
hired
three
more
buyers
for
the
unit
within
the
past
two
weeks
,
wooing
them
from
jobs
with
advertising
agencies
.

The
RJR
spokesman
said
the
company
moved
the
11
employees
to
New
York
last
month
because
the
group
had
then
been
in
the
midst
of
purchasing
ad
time
for
the
networks
'
upcoming
season
.

``
The
studies
{
on
closing
the
unit
}
could
n't
be
completed
until
now
,
''
he
said
.

The
group
's
president
,
Peter
Chrisanthopoulos
,
was
n't
in
his
office
Friday
afternoon
to
comment
.

The
U.S.
,
which
is
finalizing
its
steel-import
quotas
,
is
allocating
a
larger
share
of
its
steel
market
to
developing
and
newly
industrialized
countries
which
have
relatively
unsubsidized
steel
industries
.

Meanwhile
,
the
U.S.
has
negotiated
a
significant
cut
in
Japan
's
steel
quota
,
and
made
only
a
minor
increase
to
the
steel
allotment
for
the
European
Community
.

Brazil
,
similar
to
Mexico
and
South
Korea
,
is
expected
to
negotiate
a
somewhat
bigger
share
of
the
U.S.
market
than
it
had
under
the
previous
five-year
steel
quotas
,
which
expired
Sept.
30
.

Brazil
and
Venezuela
are
the
only
two
countries
that
have
n't
completed
steel
talks
with
the
U.S.
for
the
year
ending
Oct.
1
,
1990
.

In
recent
years
,
U.S.
steelmakers
have
supplied
about
80
%
of
the
100
million
tons
of
steel
used
annually
by
the
nation
.

Of
the
remaining
20
%
needed
,
the
steel-quota
negotiations
allocate
about
15
%
to
foreign
suppliers
,
with
the
difference
supplied
mainly
by
Canada
--
which
is
n't
included
in
the
quota
program
.

Other
countries
that
do
n't
have
formal
steel
quotas
with
the
U.S.
,
such
as
Taiwan
,
Sweden
and
Argentina
,
also
have
supplied
steel
.

Some
of
these
countries
have
in
recent
years
made
informal
agreements
with
the
U.S.
that
are
similar
to
quotas
.

The
Bush
administration
earlier
this
year
said
it
would
extend
steel
quotas
,
known
as
voluntary
restraint
agreements
,
until
March
31
,
1992
.

It
also
said
it
would
use
that
two-and-a-half
year
period
to
work
toward
an
international
consensus
on
freeing
up
the
international
steel
trade
,
which
has
been
notoriously
managed
,
subsidized
and
protected
by
governments
.

The
U.S.
termed
its
plan
,
a
``
trade
liberalization
program
,
''
despite
the
fact
that
it
is
merely
an
extension
.

Mexico
,
which
was
one
of
the
first
countries
to
conclude
its
steel
talks
with
the
U.S.
,
virtually
doubled
its
quota
to
0.95
%
of
the
U.S.
steel
market
from
0.48
%
under
the
previous
quotas
.

South
Korea
,
which
had
1.9
%
under
the
previous
quotas
,
is
set
to
get
a
small
increase
to
about
1.95
%
.

That
increase
rises
to
slightly
more
than
2
%
of
the
U.S.
market
if
a
joint
Korean-U.S.
steel
project
is
included
.

Meanwhile
,
Brazil
is
expected
to
increase
its
allowance
from
the
1.43
%
share
it
has
had
in
recent
years
.

The
EC
and
Japan
--
the
U.S.
's
largest
steel
suppliers
--
have
n't
been
filling
their
quotas
to
the
full
extent
.

The
EC
steel
industry
,
which
has
been
coping
with
strong
European
demand
,
has
been
supplying
about
5
%
of
the
U.S.
market
compared
with
recent
quotas
of
about
6.7
%
.

Japan
has
been
shipping
steel
to
total
about
4.5
%
of
the
U.S.
market
compared
with
a
quota
of
5.9
%
.

In
the
recent
talks
,
the
EC
had
its
quota
increased
about
300,000
tons
,
to
7
%
of
the
U.S.
market
from
6.7
%
in
1988
.

But
its
quota
has
been
as
high
as
6.9
%
in
1984
.

Japan
,
however
,
has
agreed
to
cut
its
quota
to
about
5
%
from
5.9
%
previously
.

Japan
,
the
EC
,
Brazil
,
Mexico
and
South
Korea
provide
about
80
%
of
the
steel
imported
to
the
U.S.
under
the
quota
program
.

The
balance
is
supplied
by
a
host
of
smaller
exporters
,
such
as
Australia
and
Venezuela
.

The
U.S.
had
about
an
extra
2
%
of
the
domestic
steel
market
to
give
to
foreign
suppliers
in
its
quota
talks
.

That
was
essentially
made
up
of
a
1
%
increase
in
the
overall
quota
program
and
1
%
from
cutting
Japan
's
allowance
.

Negotiators
from
the
White
House
trade
office
will
repeat
these
quota
negotiations
next
year
when
they
will
have
another
1
%
of
the
U.S.
steel
market
to
allocate
.

These
optional
1%-a-year
increases
to
the
steel
quota
program
are
built
into
the
Bush
administration
's
steel-quota
program
to
give
its
negotiators
leverage
with
foreign
steel
suppliers
to
try
to
get
them
to
withdraw
subsidies
and
protectionism
from
their
own
steel
industries
.

Elcotel
Inc.
expects
fiscal
second-quarter
earnings
to
trail
1988
results
,
but
anticipates
that
several
new
products
will
lead
to
a
``
much
stronger
''
performance
in
its
second
half
.

Elcotel
,
a
telecommunications
company
,
had
net
income
of
$
272,000
,
or
five
cents
a
share
,
in
its
year-earlier
second
quarter
,
ended
Sept.
30
.

Revenue
totaled
$
5
million
.

George
Pierce
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
in
an
interview
that
earnings
in
the
most
recent
quarter
will
be
about
two
cents
a
share
on
revenue
of
just
under
$
4
million
.

The
lower
results
,
Mr.
Pierce
said
,
reflect
a
12-month
decline
in
industry
sales
of
privately
owned
pay
telephones
,
Elcotel
's
primary
business
.

Although
Mr.
Pierce
expects
that
line
of
business
to
strengthen
in
the
next
year
,
he
said
Elcotel
will
also
benefit
from
moving
into
other
areas
.

Foremost
among
those
is
the
company
's
entrance
into
the

Mr.
Pierce
said

Within
the
next
year
,
Elcotel
expects
to
place
10,000
fax
machines
,
made
by
Minolta
in
Japan
,
in
hotels
,
municipal
buildings
,
drugstores
and
other
public
settings
around
the
country
.

Elcotel
will
provide
a
credit-card
reader
for
the
machines
to
collect
,
store
and
forward
billing
data
.

Mr.
Pierce
said
Elcotel
should
realize
a
minimum
of
$
10
of
recurring
net
earnings
for
each
machine
each
month
.

Elcotel
has
also
developed
an
automatic
call
processor
that
will
make
further
use
of
the
company
's
system
for
automating
and
handling
credit-card
calls
and
collect
calls
.

Automatic
call
processors
will
provide
that
system
for
virtually
any
telephone
,
Mr.
Pierce
said
,
not
just
phones
produced
by
Elcotel
.

The
company
will
also
be
producing
a
new
line
of
convenience
telephones
,
which
do
n't
accept
coins
,
for
use
in
hotel
lobbies
,
office
lobbies
,
hospitality
lounges
and
similar
settings
.

Mr.
Pierce
estimated
that
the
processors
and
convenience
phones
would
produce
about
$
5
of
recurring
net
earnings
for
each
machine
each
month
.

Britain
's
retail

index
rose
0.7

from

was

the
Central

Office
said

Quest
Medical
Inc.
said
it
adopted
a
shareholders
'
rights
plan
in
which
rights
to
purchase
shares
of
common
stock
will
be
distributed
as
a
dividend
to
shareholders
of
record
as
of
Oct.
23
.

The
company
said
the
plan
was
n't
adopted
in
response
to
any
known
offers
for
Quest
,
a
maker
and
marketer
of
hospital
products
.

The
rights
allow
shareholders
to
purchase
Quest
stock
at
a
discount
if
any
person
or
group
acquires
more
than
15
%
of
the
company
's

or
announces
a

Procter
&
Gamble
Co.
plans
to
begin
testing
next
month
a
superconcentrated
detergent
that
will
require
only
a
few
spoonfuls
per
washload
.

The
move
stems
from
lessons
learned
in
Japan
where
local
competitors
have
had
phenomenal
success
with
concentrated
soapsuds
.

It
also
marks
P&G
's
growing
concern
that
its
Japanese
rivals
,
such
as
Kao
Corp.
,
may
bring
their
superconcentrates
to
the
U.S
.

The
Cincinnati
consumer-products
giant
got
clobbered
two
years
ago
in
Japan
when
Kao
introduced
a
powerful
detergent
,
called
Attack
,
which
quickly
won
a
30
%
stake
in
the
Japanese
markets
.

``
They
do
n't
want
to
get
caught
again
,
''
says
one
industry
watcher
.

Retailers
in
Phoenix
,
Ariz.
,
say
P&G
's
new
powdered
detergent
--
to
be
called
Cheer
with
Color
Guard
--
will
be
on
shelves
in
that
market
by
early
November
.

A
P&G
spokeswoman
confirmed
that
shipments
to
Phoenix
started
late
last
month
.

She
said
the
company
will
study
results
from
this
market
before
expanding
to
others
.

Superconcentrates
are
n't
entirely
new
for
P&G
.

The
company
introduced
a
superconcentrated
Lemon
Cheer
in
Japan
after
watching
the
success
of
Attack
.

When
Attack
hit
the
shelves
in
1987
,
P&G
's
share
of
the
Japanese
market
fell
to
about
8
%
from
more
than
20
%
.

With
the
help
of
Lemon
Cheer
,
P&G
's
share
is
now
estimated
to
be
12
%
.

While
the
Japanese
have
embraced
the
compact
packaging
and
convenience
of
concentrated
products
,
the
true
test
for
P&G
will
be
in
the
$
4
billion
U.S.
detergent
market
,
where
growth
is
slow
and
liquids
have
gained
prominence
over
powders
.

The
company
may
have
chosen
to
market
the
product
under
the
Cheer
name
since
it
's
already
expanded
its
best-selling
Tide
into
16
different
varieties
,
including
this
year
's
big
hit
,
Tide
with
Bleach
.

With
superconcentrates
,
however
,
it
is
n't
always
easy
to
persuade
consumers
that
less
is
more
;
many
people
tend
to
dump
too
much
detergent
into
the
washing
machine
,
believing
that
it
takes
a
cup
of
powder
to
really
clean
the
laundry
.

In
the
early
1980s
,
P&G
tried
to
launch
here
a
concentrated
detergent
under
the
Ariel
brand
name
that
it
markets
in
Europe
.

But
the
product
,
which
was
n't
as
concentrated
as
the
new
Cheer
,
bombed
in
a
market
test
in
Denver
and
was
dropped
.

P&G
and
others
also
have
tried
repeatedly
to
hook
consumers
on
detergent
and
fabric
softener
combinations
in
pouches
,
but
they
have
n't
sold
well
,
despite
the
convenience
.

But
P&G
contends
the
new
Cheer
is
a
unique
formula
that
also
offers
an
ingredient
that
prevents
colors
from
fading
.

And
retailers
are
expected
to
embrace
the
product
,
in
part
because
it
will
take
up
less
shelf
space
.

``
When
shelf
space
was
cheap
,
bigger
was
better
,
''
says
Hugh
Zurkuhlen
,
an
analyst
at
Salomon
Bros
.

But
with
so
many
brands
vying
for
space
,
that
's
no
longer
the
case
.

If
the
new
Cheer
sells
well
,
the
trend
toward
smaller
packaging
is
likely
to
accelerate
as
competitors
follow
with
their
own
superconcentrates
.

Then
retailers
``
will
probably
push
the
{
less-established
}
brands
out
altogether
,
''
he
says
.

Competition
is
bound
to
get
tougher
if
Kao
introduces
a
product
like
Attack
in
the
U.S
.

To
be
sure
,
Kao
would
n't
have
an
easy
time
taking
U.S.
market
share
away
from
the
mighty
P&G
,
which
has
about
23
%
of
the
market
.

Kao
officials
previously
have
said
they
are
interested
in
selling
detergents
in
the
U.S.
,
but
so
far
the
company
has
focused
on
acquisitions
,
such
as
last
year
's
purchase
of
Andrew
Jergens
Co.
,
a
Cincinnati
hand-lotion
maker
.

It
also
has
a
product-testing
facility
in
California
.

Some
believe
P&G
's
interest
in
a
superconcentrated
detergent
goes
beyond
the
concern
for
the
Japanese
.

``
This
is
something
P&G
would
do
with
or
without
Kao
,
''
says
Mr.
Zurkuhlen
.

With
economic
tension
between
the
U.S.
and
Japan
worsening
,
many
Japanese
had
feared
last
week
's
visit
from
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
.

They
expected
a
new
barrage
of
demands
that
Japan
do
something
quickly
to
reduce
its
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S
.

Instead
,
they
got
a
discussion
of
the
need
for
the
U.S.
and
Japan
to
work
together
and
of
the
importance
of
the
long-term
view
.

Mrs.
Hills
'
first
trip
to
Japan
as
America
's
chief
trade
negotiator
had
a
completely
different
tone
from
last
month
's
visit
by
Commerce
Secretary
Robert
A.
Mosbacher
.

Mr.
Mosbacher
called
for
concrete
results
by
next
spring
in
negotiations
over
fundamental
Japanese
business
practices
that
supposedly
inhibit
free
trade
.

He
said
such
results
should
be
``
measurable
in
dollars
and
cents
''
in
reducing
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
with
Japan
.

But
Mrs.
Hills
,
speaking
at
a
breakfast
meeting
of
the
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Japan
on
Saturday
,
stressed
that
the
objective
``
is
not
to
get
definitive
action
by
spring
or
summer
,
it
is
rather
to
have
a
blueprint
for
action
.

''
She
added
that
she
expected
``
perhaps
to
have
a
down
payment
...
some
small
step
to
convince
the
American
people
and
the
Japanese
people
that
we
're
moving
in
earnest
.

''
How
such
remarks
translate
into
policy
wo
n't
become
clear
for
months
.

American
and
Japanese
officials
offered
several
theories
for
the
difference
in
approach
betwen
Mr.
Mosbacher
and
Mrs.
Hills
.

Many
called
it
simply
a
contrast
in
styles
.

But
some
saw
it
as
a
classic
negotiating
tactic
.

Others
said
the
Bush
administration
may
feel
the
rhetoric
on
both
sides
is
getting
out
of
hand
.

And
some
said
it
reflected
the
growing
debate
in
Washington
over
pursuing
free
trade
with
Japan
versus
some
kind
of
managed
trade
.

Asked
to
compare
her
visit
to
Mr.
Mosbacher
's
,
Mrs.
Hills
replied
:
``
I
did
n't
hear
every
word
he
spoke
,
but
as
a
general
proposition
,
I
think
we
have
a
very
consistent
trade
strategy
in
the
Bush
administration
.

''
Yet
more
than
one
American
official
who
sat
in
with
her
during
three
days
of
talks
with
Japanese
officials
said
her
tone
often
was
surprisingly
``
conciliatory
.

''
``
I
think
my
line
has
been
very
consistent
,
''
Mrs.
Hills
said
at
a
news
conference
Saturday
afternoon
.

``
I
am
painted
sometimes
as
ferocious
,
perhaps
because
I
have
a
ferocious
list
of
statutes
to
implement
.

I
do
n't
feel
very
ferocious
.

I
do
n't
feel
either
hard
or
soft
.

I
feel
committed
to
the
program
of
opening
markets
and
expanding
trade
.

''
When
she
met
the
local
press
for
the
first
time
on
Friday
,
Mrs.
Hills
firmly
reiterated
the
need
for
progress
in
removing
barriers
to
trade
in
forest
products
,
satellites
and
supercomputers
,
three
areas
targeted
under
the
Super
301
provision
of
the
1988
trade
bill
.

She
highlighted
exclusionary
business
practices
that
the
U.S.
government
has
identified
.

But
her
main
thrust
was
to
promote
the
importance
of
world-wide
free
trade
and
open
competition
.

She
said
the
trade
imbalance
was
mainly
due
to
macroeconomic
factors
and
should
n't
be
tackled
by
setting
quantitative
targets
.

At
her
news
conference
for
Japanese
reporters
,
one
economics
journalist
summed
up
the
Japanese
sense
of
relief
.

``
My
impression
was
that
you
would
be
a
scary
old
lady
,
''
he
said
,
drawing
a
few
nervous
chuckles
from
his
colleagues
.

``
But
I
am
relieved
to
see
that
you
are
beautiful
and
gentle
and
intelligent
and
a
person
of
integrity
.

''
Mrs.
Hills
'
remarks
did
raise
questions
,
at
least
among
some
U.S.
officials
,
about
what
exactly
her
stance
is
on
U.S.
access
to
the
Japanese
semiconductor
market
.

The
U.S.
share
of
the
Japanese
market
has
been
stuck
around
10
%
for
years
.

Many
Americans
have
interpreted
a
1986
agreement
as
assuring
U.S.
companies
a
20
%
share
by
1991
,
but
the
Japanese
have
denied
making
any
such
promise
.

At
one
of
her
news
conferences
,
Mrs.
Hills
said
,
``
I
believe
we
can
do
much
better
than
20
%
.

''
But
she
stressed
,
``
I
am
against
managed
trade
.

I
will
not
enter
into
an
agreement
that
stipulates
to
a
percentage
of
the
market
.

''
Traditional
Industries
Inc.
said
it
expects
to
report
a
net
loss
for
the
fourth
quarter
that
ended
June
30
and
is
seeking
new
financing
.

The
seller
of
photographic
products
and
services
said
it
is
considering
a
number
of
financing
alternatives
,
including
seeking
increases
in
its
credit
lines
.

Traditional
declined
to
estimate
the
amount
of
the
loss
and
would
n't
say
if
it
expects
to
show
a
profit
for
the
year
.

In
the
year
ended
June
30
,
1988
,
Traditional
reported
net
income
of
$
4.9
million
,
or
$
1.21
a
share
.

The
company
did
n't
break
out
its
fourth-quarter
results
.

In
the
latest
nine
months
net
income
was
$
4.7
million
,
or
$
1.31
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
44.3
million
.

Separately
,
the
company
said
it
would
file
a
delayed
fiscal-year
report
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
``
within
approximately
45
days
.

''
It
said
the
delay
resulted
from
difficulties
in
resolving
its
accounting
of
a
settlement
with
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
.

Under
an
agreement
filed
in
federal
court
in
August
to
settle
FTC
objections
to
some
Traditional
sales
practices
,
Traditional
said
it
would
establish
a
$
250,000
trust
fund
to
provide
refunds
to
certain
customers

Information
International
Inc.
said
it
was
sued
by
a
buyer
of
its
computerized
newspaper-publishing
system
,
alleging
that
the
company
failed
to
correct
deficiencies
in
the
system
.

A
spokesman
for
Information
International
said
the
lawsuit
by
two
units
of
Morris
Communications
Corp.
seeks
restitution
of
the
system
's
about
$
3
million
purchase
price
and
cancellation
of
a
software
license
provided
by
the
Morris
units
to
Information

for
alleged
failure
to

.

Information
International
said
it
believes
that
the
complaints
,
filed
in
federal
court
in
Georgia
,
are
without
merit
.

Closely
held
Morris
Communications
is
based
in

The
units
that
filed
the
suit
are
Southeastern

to

.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

As
Syms
's
``
core
business
of
off-price
retailing
grows
,
a
small
subsidiary
that
is
operationally
unrelated
becomes
a
difficult
distraction

''
said
Marcy
Syms
,
president
of
the
parent

in
a
statement
.

A
spokeswoman
said
Sulka
operates
a
total
of

The
oil
industry
's
middling
profits
could
persist
through
the
rest
of
the
year
.

Major
oil
companies
in
the
next
few
days
are
expected
to
report
much
less
robust
earnings
than
they
did
for
the
third
quarter
a
year
ago
,
largely
reflecting
deteriorating
chemical
prices
and
gasoline
profitability
.

The
gasoline
picture
may
improve
this
quarter
,
but
chemicals
are
likely
to
remain
weak
,
industry
executives
and
analysts
say
,
reducing
chances
that
profits
could
equal
their
year-earlier
performance
.

The
industry
is
``
seeing
a
softening
somewhat
in
volume
and
certainly
in
price
in
petrochemicals
,
''
Glenn
Cox
,
president
of
Phillips
Petroleum
Co.
,
said
in
an
interview
.

``
That
change
will
obviously
impact
third
and
fourth
quarter
earnings
''
for
the
industry
in
general
,
he
added
.

He
did
n't
forecast
Phillips
's
results
.

But
securities
analysts
say
Phillips
will
be
among
the
companies
hard-hit
by
weak
chemical
prices
and
will
probably
post
a
drop
in
third-quarter
earnings
.

So
,
too
,
many
analysts
predict
,
will
Exxon
Corp.
,
Chevron
Corp.
and
Amoco
Corp
.

Typical
is
what
happened
to
the
price
of
ethylene
,
a
major
commodity
chemical
produced
in
vast
amounts
by
many
oil
companies
.

It
has
plunged
13
%
since
July
to
around
26
cents
a
pound
.

A
year
ago
ethylene
sold
for
33
cents
,
peaking
at
about
34
cents
last
December
.

A
big
reason
for
the
chemical
price
retreat
is
overexpansion
.

Beginning
in
mid-1987
,
prices
began
accelerating
as
a
growing
U.S.
economy
and
the
weak
dollar
spurred
demand
.

Companies
added
capacity
furiously
.

Now
,
greatly
increased
supplies
are
on
the
market
,
while
the
dollar
is
stronger
,
and
domestic
economic
growth
is
slower
.

Third-quarter
profits
from
gasoline
were
weaker
.

``
Refining
margins
were
so
good
in
the
third
quarter
of
last
year
and
generally
not
very
good
this
year
,
''
said
William
Randol
,
a
securities
analyst
at
First
Boston
Corp
.

Oil
company
refineries
ran
flat
out
to
prepare
for
a
robust
holiday
driving
season
in
July
and
August
that
did
n't
materialize
.

The
excess
supply
pushed
gasoline
prices
down
in
that
period
.

In
addition
,
crude
oil
prices
were
up
some
from
a
year
earlier
,
further
pressuring
profitability
.

Refiners
say
margins
picked
up
in
September
,
and
many
industry
officials
believe
gasoline
profits
will
rebound
this
quarter
,
though
still
not
to
the
level
of
1988
's
fourth
quarter
.

During
the
1988
second
half
,
many
companies
posted
record
gasoline
and
chemical
profits
.

Crude
oil
production
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
surprising
element
of
companies
'
earnings
this
year
.

Prices
--
averaging
roughly
$
2
a
barrel
higher
in
the
third
quarter
than
a
year
earlier
--
have
stayed
well
above
most
companies
'
expectations
.

Demand
has
been
much
stronger
than
anticipated
,
and
it
typically
accelerates
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

``
We
could
see
higher
oil
prices
this
year
,
''
said
Bryan
Jacoboski
,
an
analyst
at
PaineWebber
Inc
.

That
will
translate
into
sharply
higher
production
profits
,
particularly
compared
with
last
year
when
oil
prices
steadily
fell
to
below
$
13
a
barrel
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

While
oil
prices
have
been
better
than
expected
,
natural
gas
prices
have
been
worse
.

In
the
third
quarter
,
they
averaged
about
5
%
less
than
they
were
in
1988
.

The
main
reason
remains
weather
.

Last
summer
was
notable
for
a
heat
wave
and
drought
that
caused
utilities
to
burn
more
natural
gas
to
feed
increased
electrical
demand
from
air
conditioning
use
.

This
summer
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
milder
weather
than
usual
.

``
We
've
been
very
disappointed
in
the
performance
of
natural
gas
prices
,
''
said
Mr.
Cox
,
Phillips
's
president
.

``
The
lagging
gas
price
is
not
going
to
assist
fourth
quarter
performance
as
many
had
expected
.

''
Going
into
the
fourth
quarter
,
natural
gas
prices
are
anywhere
from
8
%
to
17
%
lower
than
a
year
earlier
.

For
instance
,
natural
gas
currently
produced
along
the
Gulf
Coast
is
selling
on
the
spot
market
for
around
$
1.47
a
thousand
cubic
feet
,
down
13
%
from
$
1.69
a
thousand
cubic
feet
a
year
ago
.

The
Bush
administration
,
trying
to
blunt
growing
demands
from
Western
Europe
for
a
relaxation
of
controls
on
exports
to
the
Soviet
bloc
,
is
questioning
whether
Italy
's
Ing
.

C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
supplied
militarily
valuable
technology
to
the
Soviets
.

Most
of
the
Western
European
members
of
Coordinating
Committee
on
Multilateral
Export
Controls
,
the
unofficial
forum
through
which
the
U.S.
and
its
allies
align
their
export-control
policies
,
are
expected
to
argue
for
more
liberal
export
rules
at
a
meeting
to
be
held
in
Paris
Oct.
25
and
26
.

They
plan
to
press
specifically
for
a
relaxation
of
rules
governing
exports
of
machine
tools
,
computers
and
other
high-technology
products
.

But
the
Bush
administration
says
it
wants
to
see
evidence
that
all
Cocom
members
are
complying
fully
with
existing
export-control
procedures
before
it
will
support
further
liberalization
.

To
make
its
point
,
it
is
challenging
the
Italian
government
to
explain
reports
that
Olivetti
may
have
supplied
the
Soviet
Union
with
sophisticated
computer-driven
devices
that
could
be
used
to
build
parts
for
combat
aircraft
.

The
London
Sunday
Times
,
which
first
reported
the
U.S.
concerns
,
cited
a
U.S.
intelligence
report
as
the
source
of
the
allegations
that
Olivetti
exported
$
25
million
in
``
embargoed
,
state-of-the-art
,
flexible
manufacturing
systems
to
the
Soviet
aviation
industry
.

''
Olivetti
reportedly
began
shipping
these
tools
in
1984
.

A
State
Department
spokesman
acknowledged
that
the
U.S.
is
discussing
the
allegations
with
the
Italian
government
and
Cocom
,
but
declined
to
confirm
any
details
.

Italian
President
Francesco
Cossiga
promised
a
quick
investigation
into
whether
Olivetti
broke
Cocom
rules
.

President
Bush
called
his
attention
to
the
matter
during
the
Italian
leader
's
visit
here
last
week
.

Olivetti
has
denied
that
it
violated
Cocom
rules
,
asserting
that
the
reported
shipments
were
properly
licensed
by
the
Italian
authorities
.

Although
the
legality
of
these
sales
is
still
an
open
question
,
the
disclosure
could
n't
be
better
timed
to
support
the
position
of
export-control
hawks
in
the
Pentagon
and
the
intelligence
community
.

``
It
seems
to
me
that
a
story
like
this
breaks
just
before
every
important
Cocom
meeting
,
''
said
a
Washington
lobbyist
for
a
number
of
U.S.
computer
companies
.

The
Bush
administration
has
sent
conflicting
signals
about
its
export-control
policies
,
reflecting
unhealed
divisions
among
several
competing
agencies
.

Last
summer
,
Mr.
Bush
moved
the
administration
in
the
direction
of
gradual
liberalization
when
he
told
a
North
Atlantic
Treaty
Organization
meeting
that
he
would
allow
some
exceptions
to
the
Cocom
embargo
of
strategic
goods
.

But
more
recently
,
the
Pentagon
and
the
Commerce
Department
openly
feuded
over
the
extent
to
which
Cocom
should
liberalize
exports
of
personal
computers
to
the
bloc
.

However
,
these
agencies
generally
agree
that
the
West
should
be
cautious
about
any
further
liberalization
.

``
There
's
no
evidence
that
the
Soviet
program
to
(
illegally
)
acquire
Western
technology
has
diminished
,
''
said
a
State
Department
spokesman
.

Salomon
Brothers
International
Ltd.
,
a
British
subsidiary
of
Salomon
Inc.
,
announced
it
will
issue
warrants
on
shares
of
Hong
Kong
Telecommunications
Ltd
.

The
move
closely
follows
a
similar
offer
by
Salomon
of
warrants
for
shares
of
Hongkong
&
Shanghai
Banking
Corp
.

Under
the
latest
offer
,
HK$
62.5
million
(
US$
8
million
)
of
three-year
warrants
will
be
issued
in
London
,
each
giving
buyers
the
right
to
buy
one
Hong
Kong
Telecommunications
share
at
a
price
to
be
determined
Friday
.

The
50
million
warrants
will
be
priced
at
HK$
1.25
each
and
are
expected
to
carry
a
premium
to
the
share
price
of
about
26
%
.

In
trading
on
the
Stock
Exchange
of
Hong
Kong
,
the
shares
closed
Wednesday
at
HK$
4.80
each
.

At
this
price
,
the
shares
would
have
to
rise
above
HK$
6.05
for
subscribers
to
Salomon
's
issue
to
profitably
convert
their
warrants
.

While
Hong
Kong
companies
have
in
the
past
issued
warrants
on
their
own
shares
,
Salomon
's
warrants
are
the
first
here
to
be
issued
by
a
third
party
.

Salomon
will
``
cover
''
the
warrants
by
buying
sufficient
shares
,
or
options
to
purchase
shares
,
to
cover
its
entire
position
.

Bankers
said
warrants
for
Hong
Kong
stocks
are
attractive
because
they
give
foreign
investors
,
wary
of
volatility
in
the
colony
's
stock
market
,
an
opportunity
to
buy
shares
without
taking
too
great
a
risk
.

The
Hong
Kong
Telecommunications
warrants
should
be
attractive
to
buyers
in
Europe
,
the
bankers
added
,
because
the
group
is
one
of
a
handful
of
blue-chip
stocks
on
the
Hong
Kong
market
that
has
international
appeal
.

Financial
Corp.
of
Santa
Barbara
filed
suit
against
former
stock
speculator
Ivan
F.
Boesky
and
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
charging
they
defrauded
the
thrift
by
concealing
their
relationship
when
persuading
it
to
buy
$
284
million
in
high-yield
,
high-risk
junk
bonds
.

In
a
suit
filed
in
federal
court
Thursday
,
the
S&L
alleged
that
a
``
disproportionate
number
''
of
the
bonds
it
purchased
in
1984
declined
in
value
.

Financial
Corp.
purchased
the
bonds
,
the
suit
alleged
,
after
Mr.
Boesky
and
Drexel
negotiated
an
agreement
for
Vagabond
Hotels
to
purchase
a
51
%
stake
in
the
thrift
for
about
$
34
million
.

Vagabond
Hotels
was
controlled
by
Mr.
Boesky
,
who
currently
is
serving
a
prison
term
for
securities
violations
.

Officials
at
Drexel
said
they
had
n't
seen
the
suit
and
thus
could
n't
comment
.

In
addition
to
$
33
million
compensatory
damages
,
the
suit
seeks
$
100
million
in
punitive
damages
.

Also
named
in
the
suit
is
Ivan
F.
Boesky
Corp.
and
Northview
Corp.
,
the
successor
company
to
Vagabonds
Hotels
.

Northview
officials
could
n't
be
located
.

Financial
Corp.
said
it
agreed
to
buy
the
bonds
after
a
representative
of
Ivan
F.
Boesky
Corp.
visited
it
in
November
1983
and
said
Financial
Corp.
could
improve
its
financial
condition
by
purchasing
the
bonds
.

Shortly
before
the
visit
,
Mr.
Boesky
and
Drexel
representives
had
met
with
Financial
Corp.
officials
and
had
signed
a
letter
of
intent
to
acquire
the
51
%
stake
in
the
company
.

However
,
the
agreement
was
canceled
in
June
1984
.

Financial
Corp.
purchased
the
bonds
in
at
least
70
different
transactions
in
1984
and
since
then
has
realized
$
11
million
in
losses
on
them
,
the
company
said
.

Ideal
Basic
Industries
Inc.
said
its
directors
reached
an
agreement
in
principle
calling
for
HOFI
North
America
Inc.
to
combine
its
North
American
cement
holdings
with
Ideal
in
a
transaction
that
will
leave
Ideal
's
minority
shareholders
with
12.8
%
of
the
combined
company
.

HOFI
,
the
North
American
holding
company
of
Swiss
concern
Holderbank
Financiere
Glaris
Ltd.
,
previously
proposed
combining
its
100
%
stake
in
St.
Lawrence
Cement
Inc.
and
its
60
%
stake
in
Dundee
Cement
Co.
with
its
67
%
stake
in
Ideal
.

But
HOFI
's
first
offer
would
have
given
Ideal
's
other
shareholders
about
10
%
of
the
combined
company
.

Ideal
's
directors
rejected
that
offer
,
although
they
said
they
endorsed
the
merger
proposal
.

Under
the
agreement
,
HOFI
will
own
87.2
%
of
the
combined
company
.

Ideal
's
current
operations
will
represent
about
39.2
%
of
the
combined
company
.

The
transaction
is
subject
to
a
definitive
agreement
and
approval
by
Ideal
shareholders
.

Ideal
said
it
expects
to
complete
the
transaction
early
next
year
.

While
corn
and
soybean
prices
have
slumped
well
below
their
drought-induced
peaks
of
1988
,
wheat
prices
remain
stubbornly
high
.

And
they
're
likely
to
stay
that
way
for
months
to
come
,
analysts
say
.

For
one
thing
,
even
with
many
farmers
planting
more
winter
wheat
this
year
than
last
,
tight
wheat
supplies
are
likely
to
support
prices
well
into
1990
,
the
analysts
say
.

And
if
rain
does
n't
fall
soon
across
many
of
the
Great
Plains
'
wheat-growing
areas
,
yields
in
the
crop
now
being
planted
could
be
reduced
,
further
squeezing
supplies
.

Also
supporting
prices
are
expectations
that
the
Soviet
Union
will
place
substantial
buying
orders
over
the
next
few
months
.

By
next
May
31
,
stocks
of
U.S.
wheat
to
be
carried
over
into
the
next
season
--
before
the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
is
harvested
--
are
projected
to
drop
to
443
million
bushels
.

That
would
be
the
lowest
level
since
the
early
1970s
.

Stocks
were
698
million
bushels
on
May
31
of
this
year
.

In
response
to
dwindling
domestic
supplies
,
Agriculture
Secretary
Clayton
Yeutter
last
month
said
the
U.S.
government
would
slightly
increase
the
number
of
acres
farmers
can
plant
in
wheat
for
next
year
and
still
qualify
for
federal
support
payments
.

The
government
estimates
that
the
new
plan
will
boost
production
next
year
by
about
66
million
bushels
.

It
now
estimates
production
for
next
year
at
just
under
2.6
billion
bushels
,
compared
with
this
year
's
estimated
2.04
billion
and
a
drought-stunted
1.81
billion
in
1988
.

But
the
full
effect
on
prices
of
the
winter
wheat
now
being
planted
wo
n't
be
felt
until
the
second
half
of
next
year
.

Until
then
,
limited
stocks
are
likely
to
keep
prices
near
the
$
4-a-bushel
level
,
analysts
say
.

On
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
Friday
,
wheat
for
December
delivery
settled
at
$
4.0675
a
bushel
,
unchanged
.

In
theory
at
least
,
tight
supplies
next
spring
could
leave
the
wheat
futures
market
susceptible
to
a
supply-demand
squeeze
,
said
Daniel
Basse
,
a
futures
analyst
with
AgResource
Co.
in
Chicago
.

Such
a
situation
can
wreak
havoc
,
as
was
shown
by
the
emergency
that
developed
in
soybean
futures
trading
this
summer
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

In
July
,
the
CBOT
ordered
Ferruzzi
Finanziaria
S.p
.

A.
to
liquidate
futures
positions
equal
to
about
23
million
bushels
of
soybeans
.

The
exchange
said
it
feared
that
some
members
would
n't
be
able
to
find
enough
soybeans
to
deliver
and
would
have
to
default
on
their
contractual
obligation
to
the
Italian
conglomerate
,
which
had
refused
requests
to
reduce
its
holdings
.

Ferruzzi
has
denied
it
was
trying
to
manipulate
the
soybean
futures
market
.

Unseasonably
hot
,
dry
weather
across
large
portions
of
the
Great
Plains
and
in
wheat-growing
areas
in
Washington
and
Oregon
is
threatening
to
reduce
the
yield
from
this
season
's
winter
wheat
crop
,
said
Conrad
Leslie
,
a
futures
analyst
and
head
of
Leslie
Analytical
in
Chicago
.

For
example
,
in
the
Oklahoma
panhandle
,
40
%
or
more
of
the
topsoil
is
short
of
moisture
.

That
figure
climbs
to
about
47
%
in
wheat-growing
portions
of
Kansas
,
he
said
.

The
Soviet
Union
has
n't
given
any
clear
indication
of
its
wheat
purchase
plans
,
but
many
analysts
expect
Moscow
to
place
sizable
orders
for
U.S.
wheat
in
the
next
few
months
,
further
supporting
prices
.

``
Wheat
prices
will
increasingly
pivot
off
of
Soviet
demand
''
in
coming
weeks
,
predicted
Richard
Feltes
,
vice
president
,
research
,
for
Refco
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

Looking
ahead
to
other
commodity
markets
this
week
:
Orange
Juice
Traders
will
be
watching
to
see
how
long
and
how
far
the
price
decline
that
began
Friday
will
go
.

Late
Thursday
,
after
the
close
of
trading
,
the
market
received
what
would
normally
have
been
a
bullish
U.S.
Department
of
Agriculture
estimate
of
the
1989-90
Florida
orange
crop
.

It
was
near
the
low
range
of
estimates
,
at
130
million
90-pound
boxes
,
compared
with
146.6
million
boxes
last
season
.

However
,
as
expected
,
Brazil
waited
for
the
crop
estimate
to
come
out
and
then
cut
the
export
price
of
its
juice
concentrate
to
about
$
1.34
a
pound
from
around
$
1.55
.

Friday
's
consequent
selling
of
futures
contracts
erased
whatever
supportive
effect
the
U.S.
report
might
have
had
and
sent
the
November
orange
juice
contract
down
as
much
as
6.55
cents
a
pound
at
one
time
.

It
settled
with
a
loss
of
4.95
cents
at
$
1.3210
a
pound
.

Brazilian
juice
,
after
a
delay
caused
by
drought
at
the
start
of
its
crop
season
,
is
beginning
to
arrive
in
the
U.S.
in
large
quantities
.

Brazil
wants
to
stimulate
demand
for
its
product
,
which
is
going
to
be
in
plentiful
supply
.

The
price
cut
,
one
analyst
said
,
appeared
to
be
aimed
even
more
at
Europe
,
where
consumption
of
Brazilian
juice
has
fallen
.

It
's
a
dollar-priced
product
,
and
the
strong
dollar
has
made
it
more
expensive
in
Europe
,
the
analyst
said
.

New
York
futures
prices
have
dropped
significantly
from
more
than
$
2
a
pound
at
midyear
.

Barring
a
cold
snap
or
other
crop
problems
in
the
growing
areas
,
downward
pressure
on
prices
is
likely
to
continue
into
January
,
when
harvesting
and
processing
of
oranges
in
Florida
reach
their
peak
,
the
analyst
said
.

Energy
Although
some
analysts
look
for
profit-taking
in
the
wake
of
Friday
's
leap
in
crude
oil
prices
,
last
week
's
rally
is
generally
expected
to
continue
this
week
.

``
I
would
continue
to
look
for
a
stable
crude
market
,
at
least
in
futures
''
trading
,
said
William
Hinton
,
an
energy
futures
broker
with
Stotler
&
Co
.

Friday
capped
a
week
of
steadily
rising
crude
oil
prices
in
both
futures
and
spot
markets
.

On
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
crude
for
November
delivery
finished
at
$
20.89
a
barrel
,
up
42
cents
on
the
day
.

On
European
markets
,
meanwhile
,
spot
prices
of
North
Sea
crudes
were
up
35
to
75
cents
a
barrel
.

``
This
market
still
wants
to
go
higher
,
''
said
Nauman
Barakat
,
a
first
vice
president
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

He
predicted
that
the
November
contract
will
reach
$
21.50
a
barrel
or
more
on
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
.

There
has
been
little
news
to
account
for
such
buoyancy
in
the
oil
markets
.

Analysts
generally
cite
a
lack
of
bearish
developments
as
well
as
rumors
of
a
possible
tightening
of
supplies
of
some
fuels
and
crudes
.

There
also
are
recurring
reports
that
the
Soviet
Union
is
having
difficulties
with
its
oil
exports
and
that
Nigeria
has
about
reached
its
production
limit
and
ca
n't
produce
as
much
as
it
could
sell
.

Many
traders
foresee
a
tightening
of
near-term
supplies
,
particularly
of
high-quality
crudes
such
as
those
produced
in
the
North
Sea
and
in
Nigeria
.

If
a
hostile
predator
emerges
for
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
,
co-founders
Charles
and
Maurice
Saatchi
will
lead
a
management
buy-out
attempt
,
an
official
close
to
the
company
said
.

Financing
for
any
takeover
attempt
may
be
problematic
in
the
wake
of
Friday
's
stock-market
sell-off
in
New
York
and
turmoil
in
the
junk-bond
market
.

But
the
beleaguered
British
advertising
and
consulting
giant
,
which
last
week
named
a
new
chief
executive
officer
to
replace
Maurice
Saatchi
,
has
been
the
subject
of
intense
takeover
speculation
for
weeks
.

Last
week
,
Saatchi
's
largest
shareholder
,
Southeastern
Asset
Management
,
said
it
had
been
approached
by
one
or
more
third
parties
interested
in
a
possible
restructuring
.

And
Carl
Spielvogel
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Saatchi
's
big
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
advertising
unit
,
said
he
had
offered
to
lead
a
management
buy-out
of
the
company
,
but
was
rebuffed
by
Charles
Saatchi
.

Mr.
Spielvogel
said
he
would
n't
launch
a
hostile
bid
.

The
executive
close
to
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
said
that
``
if
a
bidder
came
up
with
a
ludicrously
high
offer
,
a
crazy
offer
which
Saatchi
knew
it
could
n't
beat
,
it
would
have
no
choice
but
to
recommend
it
to
shareholders
.

But
{
otherwise
}
it
would
undoubtedly
come
back
''
with
an
offer
by
management
.

The
executive
said
any
buy-out
would
be
led
by
the
current
board
,
whose
chairman
is
Maurice
Saatchi
and
whose
strategic
guiding
force
is
believed
to
be
Charles
Saatchi
.

Mr.
Spielvogel
is
n't
part
of
the
board
,
nor
are
any
of
the
other
heads
of
Saatchi
's
big
U.S.-based
ad
agencies
.

The
executive
did
n't
name
any
price
,
but
securities
analysts
have
said
Saatchi
would
fetch
upward
of
$
1.3
billion
.

The
executive
denied
speculation
that
Saatchi
was
bringing
in
the
new
chief
executive
officer
only
to
clean
up
the
company
financially
so
that
the
brothers
could
lead
a
buy-back
.

That
speculation
abounded
Friday
as
industry
executives
analyzed
the
appointment
of
the
new
chief
executive
,
Robert
Louis-Dreyfus
,
who
joins
Saatchi
and
becomes
a
member
of
its
board
on
Jan.
1
.

Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus
,
formerly
chief
executive
of
the
pharmaceutical
research
firm
IMS
International
Inc.
,
has
a
reputation
as
a
savvy
financial
manager
,
and
will
be
charged
largely
with
repairing
Saatchi
's
poor
financial
state
.

Asked
about
the
speculation
that
Mr.
Louis-Dreyfus
has
been
hired
to
pave
the
way
for
a
buy-out
by
the
brothers
,
the
executive
replied
,
``
That
is
n't
the
reason
Dreyfus
has
been
brought
in
.

He
was
brought
in
to
turn
around
the
company
.

''
Separately
,
several
Saatchi
agency
clients
said
they
believe
the
company
's
management
shakeup
will
have
little
affect
on
them
.

``
It
has
n't
had
any
impact
on
us
,
nor
do
we
expect
it
to
,
''
said
a
spokeswoman
for
Miller
Brewing
Co.
,
a
major
client
of
Backer
Spielvogel
.

John
Lampe
,
director
of
advertising
at
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
a
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Advertising
client
,
said
:
``
We
have
no
problem
with
the
announcement
,
because
we
do
n't
know
what
change
it
's
going
to
bring
about
.

We
are
n't
going
to
change
agencies
because
of
a
change
in
London
.

''
Executives
at
Backer
Spielvogel
client
Avis
Inc.
,
as
well
as
at
Saatchi
client
Philips
Lighting
Co.
,
also
said
they
saw
no
effect
.

Executives
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
,
a
Backer
Spielvogel
client
that
is
reviewing
its
account
,
declined
comment
.

Mr.
Spielvogel
had
said
that
Prudential-Bache
was
prepared
to
finance
either
a
management
buy-out
and
restructuring
,
or
a
buy-out
of
Backer
Spielvogel
alone
,
led
by
him

NOT-GUILTY
PLEA
:
As
expected
,
Young

along
with
two
senior

,
pleaded
not
guilty
in
federal

in
New

,
Conn.
,
to

.

The

KOREAN
AGENCY
:
The
Samsung
Group
and
Bozell
Inc.
agreed
to
establish
a
joint
venture
advertising
agency
in
South
Korea
.

Bozell
Cheil
Corp.
,
as
the
new
agency
will
be
called
,
will
be
based
in
Seoul
and
is
70
%
owned
by
Samsung
and
30
%
owned
by
Bozell
.

Samsung
already
owns
Korea
First
Advertising
Co.
,
that
country
's
largest
agency
.

Bozell
joins
Backer

and
Ogilvy

Citing
a
payment
from
a
supplier
and
strong
sales
of
certain
data-storage
products
,
Maxtor
Corp.
said
earnings
and
revenue
jumped
in
its
second
quarter
ended
Sept.
24
.

The
maker
of
computer-data-storage
products
said
net
income
rose
to
$
4.8
million
,
or
23
cents
a
share
,
from
year-earlier
net
of
$
1.1
million
,
or
five
cents
a
share
.

Revenue
soared
to
$
117
million
from
$
81.5
million
.

Maxtor
said
its
results
were
boosted
by
$
2
million
in
payments
received
from
a
supplier
,
for
a
certain
line
of
products
that
Maxtor
is
n't
going
to
sell
anymore
.

Maxtor
said
effects
from
discontinuing
the
line
may
have
a
positive
effect
on
future
earnings
and
revenue
.

A
spokeswoman
would
n't
elaborate
,
but
the
company
said
the
discontinued
product
has
never
been
a
major
source
of
revenue
or
profit
.

Operationally
,
Maxtor
benefited
from
robust
sales
of
products
that
store
data
for
high-end
personal
computers
and
computer
workstations
.

In
the
fiscal
first
half
,
net
was
$
7
million
,
or
34
cents
a
share
,
up
from
the
year-earlier
$
3.1
million
,
or
15
cents
a
share
.

Revenue
rose
to
$
225.5
million
from
$
161.8
million
.

Robert
G.
Walden
,
62
years

,
was
elected
a
director
of
this
provider
of
advanced
technology
systems
and
services
,
increasing
the
board
to
eight
members
.

He
retired
as
senior
vice
president
,
finance
and
administration
,
and
chief
financial
officer
of
the
company
Oct.
1
.

Southmark
Corp.
said
that
it
filed
part
of
its
10-K
report
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
but
that
the
filing
does
n't
include
its
audited
financial
statements
and
related
information
.

The
real
estate
and
thrift
concern
,
operating
under
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
,
said
it
told
the
SEC
it
could
n't
provide
financial
statements
by
the
end
of
its
first
extension
``
without
unreasonable
burden
or
expense
.

''
The
company
asked
for
a
15-day
extension
Sept.
30
,
when
the
financial
reports
were
due
.

Southmark
said
it
plans
to
amend
its
10K
to
provide
financial
results
as
soon
as
its
audit
is
completed
.

Alan
Seelenfreund

of
this
processor
of
prescription
claims
,
succeeding
Thomas
W.
Field

Mr.
Field
also
had
been
chairman
of
McKesson

,
resigning
that
post
after
a
dispute
with
the
board
over
corporate
strategy
.

Mr.
Seelenfreund
is
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
of
McKesson
and
will
continue
in
those
roles
.

PCS
also
named
Rex
R.
Malson

,
executive
vice

at
McKesson
,
as
a
director
,
filling
the
seat

MedChem
Products
Inc.
said
a
U.S.
District
Court
in
Boston
ruled
that
a
challenge
by
MedChem
to
the
validity
of
a
U.S.
patent
held
by
Pharmacia
Inc.
was
``
without
merit
.

''
Pharmacia
,
based
in
Upsala
,
Sweden
,
had
charged
in
a
lawsuit
against
MedChem
that
MedChem
's
AMVISC
product
line
infringes
on
the
Pharmacia
patent
.

The
patent
is
related
to
hyaluronic
acid
,
a
rooster-comb
extract
used
in
eye
surgery
.

In
its
lawsuit
,
Pharmacia
is
seeking
unspecified
damages
and
a
preliminary
injunction
to
block
MedChem
from
selling
the
AMVISC
products
.

A
MedChem
spokesman
said
the
products
contribute
about
a
third
of
MedChem
's
sales
and
10
%
to
20
%
of
its
earnings
.

In
the
year
ended
Aug.
31
,
1988
,
MedChem
earned
$
2.9
million
,
or
72
cents
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
17.4
million
.

MedChem
said
the
court
's
ruling
was
issued
as
part
of
a
``
first-phase
trial
''
in
the
patent-infringement
proceedings
and
concerns
only
one
of
its
defenses
in
the
case
.

It
said
it
is
considering
``
all
of
its
options
in
light
of
the
decision
,
including
a
possible
appeal
.

''
The
medical-products
company
added
that
it
plans
to
``
assert
its
other
defenses
''
against
Pharmacia
's
lawsuit
,
including
the
claim
that
it
has
n't
infringed
on
Pharmacia
's
patent
.

MedChem
said
that
the
court
scheduled
a
conference
for
next
Monday
--
to
set
a
date
for
proceedings
on
Pharmacia
's
motion
for
a
preliminary
injunction
.

Newspaper
publishers
are
reporting
mixed
third-quarter
results
,
aided
by
favorable
newsprint
prices
and
hampered
by
flat
or
declining
advertising
linage
,
especially
in
the
Northeast
.

Adding
to
unsteadiness
in
the
industry
,
seasonal
retail
ad
spending
patterns
in
newspapers
have
been
upset
by
shifts
in
ownership
and
general
hardships
within
the
retail
industry
.

In
New
York
,
the
Bonwit
Teller
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
department
stores
have
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
,
while
the
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
,
Bloomingdale
's
and
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
department-store
chains
are
for
sale
.

Many
papers
throughout
the
country
are
also
faced
with
a
slowdown
in
classified-ad
spending
,
a
booming
category
for
newspapers
in
recent
years
.

Until
recently
,
industry
analysts
believed
decreases
in
retail
ad
spending
had
bottomed
out
and
would
in
fact
increase
in
this
year
's
third
and
fourth
quarters
.

All
bets
are
off
,
analysts
say
,
because
of
the
shifting
ownership
of
the
retail
chains
.

``
Improved
paper
prices
will
help
offset
weakness
in
linage
,
but
the
retailers
'
problems
have
affected
the
amount
of
ad
linage
they
usually
run
,
''
said
Edward
J.
Atorino
,
industry
analyst
for
Salomon
Brothers
Inc

``
Retailers
are
just
in
disarray

''
For
instance
,
Gannett
Co.
posted
an
11
%
gain
in
net
income
,
as
total
ad
pages
dropped
at
USA
Today
,
but
advertising
revenue
rose
because
of
a
higher
circulation
rate
base
and
increased
rates
.

Gannett
's
83
daily
and
35
non-daily
newspapers
reported
a
3
%
increase
in
advertising
and
circulation
revenue
.

Total
advertising
linage
was
``
modestly
''
lower
as
classified-ad
volume
increased
,
while
there
was
``
softer
demand
''
for
retail
and
national
ad
linage
,
said
John
Curley
,
Gannett
's
chief
executive
officer
.

At
USA
Today
,
ad
pages
totaled
785
for
the
quarter
,
down
9.2
%
from
the
1988
period
,
which
was
helped
by
increased
ad
spending
from
the
Summer
Olympics
.

While
USA
Today
's
total
paid
ad
pages
for
the
year
to
date
totaled
2,735
,
a
decrease
of
4
%
from
last
year
,
the
paper
's
ad
revenue
increased
8
%
in
the
quarter
and
13
%
in
the
nine
months
.

In
the
nine
months
,
Gannett
's
net
rose
9.5
%
to
$
270
million
,
or
$
1.68
a
share
,
from
$
247

,
or
$
1.52
a

.

Revenue
gained
6
%
to
$
2.55
billion
from
$
2.4
billion
.

At
Dow
Jones
&
Co.
,
third-quarter
net
income
fell
9.9
%
from
the
year-earlier
period
.

Net
fell
to
$
28.8
million
,
or
29
cents
a
share
,
from
$
32
million
,
or
33

a

.

The
year-earlier
period
included
a
one-time
gain
of
$
3.5
million
,
or
four
cents
a

.

Revenue
gained
5.3
%
to
$
404.1
million
from
$
383.8

.

The
drop
in
profit
reflected
,
in
part
,
continued
softness
in
financial
advertising
at
The
Wall
Street
Journal
and
Barron
's
magazine
.

Ad
linage
at
the
Journal
fell
6.1
%
in
the
third
quarter
.

Affiliated
Publications

reversed
a
year-earlier
third

net
loss
.

The
publisher
of
the
Boston
Globe
reported
net
of

by
softness
in
ad
volume
at
the
Boston
newspaper
.

Third-quarter
profit
estimates
for
several
companies
are
being
strongly
affected
by
the
price
of
newsprint
,
which
in
the
last
two
years
has
had
several
price
increases
.

After
a
supply
crunch
caused
prices
to
rise
14
%
since
1986
to
$
650
a
metric
ton
,
analysts
are
encouraged
,
because
they
do
n't
expect
a
price
increase
for
the
rest
of
this
year
.

Companies
with
daily
newspapers
in
the
Northeast
will
need
the
stable
newsprint
prices
to
ease
damage
from
weak
ad
linage
.

Mr.
Atorino
at
Salomon
Brothers
said
he
estimates
that
Times
Mirror
Co.
's
earnings
were
down
for
the
third
quarter
,
because
of
soft
advertising
levels
at
its
Long
Island
Newsday
and
Hartford
Courant
newspapers
.

Trouble
on
the
East
Coast
was
likely
offset
by
improved
ad
linage
at
the
Los
Angeles
Times
,
which
this
week
also
unveiled
a
redesign
.

New
York
Times
Co.
is
expected
to
report
lower
earnings
for
the
third
quarter
because
of
continued
weak
advertising
levels
at
its
flagship
New
York
Times
and
deep
discounting
of
newsprint
at
its
affiliate
,
Forest
Products
Group
.

``
Times
Co.
's
regional
daily
newspapers
are
holding
up
well
,
but
there
is
little
sign
that
things
will
improve
in
the
New
York
market
,
''
said
Alan
Kassan
,
an
analyst
with
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Washington
Post
Co.
is
expected
to
report
improved
earnings
,
largely
because
of
increased
cable
revenue
and
publishing
revenue
helped
by
an
improved
retail
market
in
the
Washington
area
.

According
to
analysts
,
profits
were
also
helped
by
successful
cost-cutting
measures
at
Newsweek
.

The
news-weekly
has
faced
heightened
competition
from
rival
Time
magazine
and
a
relatively
flat
magazine
advertising
market
.

Knight-Ridder
Inc.
is
faced
with
continued
uncertainty
over
the
pending
joint
operating
agreement
between
its
Detroit
Free
Press
and
Gannett
's
Detroit
News
,
and
has
told
analysts
that
earnings
were
down
in
the
third
quarter
.

However
,
analysts
point
to
positive
advertising
spending
at
several
of
its
major
daily
newspapers
,
such
as
the
Miami
Herald
and
San
Jose
Mercury
News
.

``
The
Miami
market
is
coming
back
strong
after
a
tough
couple
of
years
''
when
Knight-Ridder
``
was
starting
up
a
Hispanic
edition
and
circulation
was
falling
,
''
said
Bruce
Thorp
,
an
analyst
for
Provident
National
Bank
.

General
Motors
Corp.
,
in
a
series
of
moves
that
angered
union
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,
has
signaled
that
as
many
as
five
North
American
assembly
plants
may
not
survive
the
mid-1990s
as
the
corporation
struggles
to
cut
its
excess
vehicle-making
capacity
.

In
announcements
to
workers
late
last
week
,
GM
effectively
signed
death
notices
for
two
full-sized
van
assembly
plants
,
and
cast
serious
doubt
on
the
futures
of
three
U.S.
car
factories
.

GM
is
under
intense
pressure
to
close
factories
that
became
unprofitable
as
the
giant
auto
maker
's
U.S.
market
share
skidded
during
the
past
decade
.

The
company
,
currently
using
about
80
%
of
its
North
American
vehicle
capacity
,
has
vowed
it
will
run
at
100
%
of
capacity
by
1992
.

Just
a
month
ago
,
GM
announced
it
would
make
an
aging
assembly
plant
in
Lakewood
,
Ga.
,
the
eighth
U.S.
assembly
facility
to
close
since
1987
.

Now
,
GM
appears
to
be
stepping
up
the
pace
of
its
factory
consolidation
to
get
in
shape
for
the
1990s
.

One
reason
is
mounting
competition
from
new
Japanese
car
plants
in
the
U.S.
that
are
pouring
out
more
than
one
million
vehicles
a
year
at
costs
lower
than
GM
can
match
.

Another
is
that
United
Auto
Workers
union
officials
have
signaled
they
want
tighter
no-layoff
provisions
in
the
new
Big
Three
national
contract
that
will
be
negotiated
next
year
.

GM
officials
want
to
get
their
strategy
to
reduce
capacity
and
the
work
force
in
place
before
those
talks
begin
.

The
problem
,
however
,
is
that
GM
's
moves
are
coming
at
a
time
when
UAW
leaders
are
trying
to
silence
dissidents
who
charge
the
union
is
too
passive
in
the
face
of
GM
layoffs
.

Against
that
backdrop
,
UAW
Vice
President
Stephen
P.
Yokich
,
who
recently
became
head
of
the
union
's
GM
department
,
issued
a
statement
Friday
blasting
GM
's
``
flagrant
insensitivity
''
toward
union
members
.

The
auto
maker
's
decision
to
let
word
of
the
latest
shutdowns
and
product
reassignments
trickle
out
in
separate
communiques
to
the
affected
plants
showed
``
disarray
''
and
an
``
inability
or
unwillingness
to
provide
consistent
information
,
''
Mr.
Yokich
said
.

GM
officials
told
workers
late
last
week
of
the
following
moves
:
Production
of
full-sized
vans
will
be
consolidated
into
a
single
plant
in
Flint
,
Mich
.

That
means
two
plants
--
one
in
Scarborough
,
Ontario
,
and
the
other
in
Lordstown
,
Ohio
--
probably
will
be
shut
down
after
the
end
of
1991
.

The
shutdowns
will
idle
about
3,000
Canadian
assembly
workers
and
about
2,500
workers
in
Ohio
.

Robert
White
,
Canadian
Auto
Workers
union
president
,
used
the
impending
Scarborough
shutdown
to
criticize
the
U.S.-Canada
free
trade
agreement
and
its
champion
,
Prime
Minister
Brian
Mulroney
.

But
Canadian
auto
workers
may
benefit
from
a
separate
GM
move
that
affects
three
U.S.
car
plants
and
one
in
Quebec
.

Workers
at
plants
in
Van
Nuys
,
Calif.
,
Oklahoma
City
and
Pontiac
,
Mich.
,
were
told
their
facilities
are
no
longer
being
considered
to
build
the
next
generation
of
the
Pontiac
Firebird
and
Chevrolet
Camaro
muscle
cars
.

GM
is
studying
whether
it
can
build
the
new
Camaro-Firebird
profitably
at
a
plant
in
St.
Therese
,
Quebec
,
company
and
union
officials
said
.

That
announcement
left
union
officials
in
Van
Nuys
and
Oklahoma
City
uncertain
about
their
futures
.

The
Van
Nuys
plant
,
which
employs
about
3,000
workers
,
does
n't
have
a
product
to
build
after
1993
.

Jerry
Shrieves
,
UAW
local
president
,
said
the
facility
was
asked
to
draw
up
plans
to
continue
working
as
a
``
flex
plant
,
''
which
could
build
several
different
types
of
products
on
short
notice
to
satisfy
demand
.

At
the
Oklahoma
City
plant
,
which
employs
about
6,000
workers
building
the
eight-year-old
A-body
mid-sized
cars
,
Steve
Featherston
,
UAW
local
vice
president
,
said
the
plant
has
no
new
product
lined
up
,
and
``
none
of
us
knows
''
when
the
A-body
cars
will
die
.

He
said
he
believes
GM
has
plans
to
keep
building
A-body
cars
into
the
mid-1990s
.

At
Pontiac
,
however
,
the
Camaro-Firebird
decision
appears
to
erase
UAW
hopes
that
GM
would
reopen
the
shuttered
assembly
plant
that
last
built
the
plastic-bodied
,
two-seater
Pontiac
Fiero
model
.

The
Fiero
plant
was
viewed
as
a
model
of
union-management
cooperation
at
GM
before
slow
sales
of
the
Fiero
forced
the
company
to
close
the
factory
last
year
.

Union
officials
have
taken
a
beating
politically
as
a
result
.

Dissident
UAW
members
have
used
the
Fiero
plant
as
a
symbol
of
labor-management
cooperation
's
failure
.

Institut
Merieux
S.A.
of
France
said
the
Canadian
government
raised
an
obstacle
to
its
proposed
acquisition
of
Connaught
BioSciences
Inc.
for
942
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
801.6
million
)
.

Merieux
said
the
government
's
minister
of
industry
,
science
and
technology
told
it
that
he
was
n't
convinced
that
the
purchase
is
likely
to
be
of
``
net
benefit
''
to
Canada
.

Canadian
investment
rules
require
that
big
foreign
takeovers
meet
that
standard
.

The
French
company
said
the
government
gave
it
30
days
in
which
to
submit
information
to
further
support
its
takeover
plan
.

Both
Merieux
and
Connaught
are
biotechnology
research
and
vaccine
manufacturing
concerns
.

The
government
's
action
was
unusual
.

Alan
Nymark
,
executive
vice
president
of
Investment
Canada
,
which
oversees
foreign
takeovers
,
said
it
marked
the
first
time
in
its
four-year
history
that
the
agency
has
made
an
adverse
net-benefit
decision
about
the
acquisition
of
a
publicly
traded
company
.

He
said
it
has
reached
the
same
conclusions
about
some
attempts
to
buy
closely
held
concerns
,
but
eventually
allowed
those
acquisitions
to
proceed
.

``
This
is
n't
a
change
in
government
policy
;
this
provision
has
been
used
before
,
''
said
Jodi
Redmond
,
press
secretary
for
Harvie
Andre
,
Canada
's
minister
of
industry
,
science
and
technology
.

Mr.
Andre
issued
the
ruling
based
on
a
recommendation
by
Investment
Canada
.

Spokesmen
for
Merieux
and
Connaught
said
they
had
n't
been
informed
of
specific
areas
of
concern
by
either
the
government
or
Investment
Canada
,
but
added
they
hope
to
have
more
information
early
this
week
.

Investment
Canada
declined
to
comment
on
the
reasons
for
the
government
decision
.

Viren
Mehta
,
a
partner
with
Mehta
&
Isaly
,
a
New
York-based
pharmaceutical
industry
research
firm
,
said
the
government
's
ruling
was
n't
unexpected
.

``
This
has
become
a
very
politicized
deal
,
concerning
Canada
's
only
large
,
world-class
bio-research
or
pharmaceutical
company
,
''
Mr.
Mehta
said
.

Mr.
Mehta
said
the
move
that
could
allow
the
transaction
to
go
ahead
as
planned
could
be
an
out-of-court
settlement
of
Connaught
's
dispute
with
the
University
of
Toronto
.

The
University
is
seeking
to
block
the
acquisition
of
Connaught
by
foreign
interests
,
citing
concerns
about
the
amount
of
research
that
would
be
done
in
Canada
.

The
university
is
considering
a
settlement
proposal
made
by
Connaught
.

While
neither
side
will
disclose
its
contents
,
Mr.
Mehta
expects
it
to
contain
more
specific
guarantees
on
research
and
development
spending
levels
in
Canada
than
Merieux
offered
to
Investment
Canada
.

Some
analysts
,
such
as
Murray
Grossner
of
Toronto-based
Richardson
Greenshields
Inc.
,
believe
the
government
ruling
leaves
the
door
open
for
other
bidders
,
such
as
Switzerland
's
Ciba-Geigy
and
Chiron
Corp.
of
Emeryville
,
Calif
.

Officials
for
the
two
concerns
,
which
are
bidding
C$
30
a
share
for
Connaught
,
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

French
state-owned
Rhone-Poulenc
S.A.
holds
51
%
of
Merieux
.

Weatherford
International
Inc.
said
it
canceled
plans
for
a
preferred-stock
swap
but
may
resume
payment
of
dividends
on
the
stock
,
and
added
that
it
expects
to
publicly
offer
about
10
million
common
shares
.

The
company
said
it
planned
to
offer
an
undetermined
number
of
common
shares
in
exchange
for
the
585,000
shares
of
its
preferred
stock
outstanding
.

The
exchange
ratio
was
never
established
.

Weatherford
said
market
conditions
led
to
the
cancellation
of
the
planned
exchange
.

The
energy-services
concern
said
,
however
,
that
in
January
1990
,
it
may
resume
payments
of
dividends
on
the
preferred
stock
.

Weatherford
suspended
its
preferred-dividend
payment
in
October
1985
and
said
it
has
n't
any
plans
to
catch
up
on
dividends
in
arrears
about
$
6
million
,
but
will
do
so
some
time
in
the
future
.

Additionally
,
the
company
said
it
filed
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
for
the
proposed
offering
of
10
million
shares
of
common
stock
,
expected
to
be
offered
in
November
.

The
company
said
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
Howard
,
Weil
,
Labouisse
,
Friedrichs
Inc.
,
underwriters
for
the
offering
,
were
granted
an
option
to
buy
as
much
as
an
additional
1.5
million
shares
to
cover
over-allotments
.

Proceeds
will
be
used
to
eliminate
and
restructure
bank
debt
.

Weatherford
currently
has
approximately
11.1
million
common
shares
outstanding
.

Earnings
for
most
of
the
nation
's
major
pharmaceutical
makers
are
believed
to
have
moved
ahead
briskly
in
the
third
quarter
,
as
companies
with
newer
,
big-selling
prescription
drugs
fared
especially
well
.

For
the
third
consecutive
quarter
,
however
,
most
of
the
companies
'
revenues
were
battered
by
adverse
foreign-currency
translations
as
a
result
of
the
strong
dollar
abroad
.

Analysts
said
that
Merck
&
Co.
,
Eli
Lilly
&
Co.
,
Warner-Lambert
Co.
and
the
Squibb
Corp.
unit
of
Bristol-Myers
Squibb
Co.
all
benefited
from
strong
sales
of
relatively
new
,
higher-priced
medicines
that
provide
wide
profit
margins
.

Less
robust
earnings
at
Pfizer
Inc.
and
Upjohn
Co.
were
attributed
to
those
companies
'
older
products
,
many
of
which
face
stiffening
competition
from
generic
drugs
and
other
medicines
.

Joseph
Riccardo
,
an
analyst
with
Bear
,
Stearns
&
Co.
,
said
that
over
the
past
few
years
most
drug
makers
have
shed
their
slow-growing
businesses
and
instituted
other
cost
savings
,
such
as
consolidating
manufacturing
plants
and
administrative
staffs
.

As
a
result
,
``
major
new
products
are
having
significant
impact
,
even
on
a
company
with
very
large
revenues
,
''
Mr.
Riccardo
said
.

Analysts
said
profit
for
the
dozen
or
so
big
drug
makers
,
as
a
group
,
is
estimated
to
have
climbed
between
11
%
and
14
%
.

While
that
's
not
spectacular
,
Neil
Sweig
,
an
analyst
with
Prudential
Bache
,
said
that
the
rate
of
growth
will
``
look
especially
good
as
compared
to
other
companies
if
the
economy
turns
downward
.

''
Mr.
Sweig
estimated
that
Merck
's
profit
for
the
quarter
rose
by
about
22
%
,
propelled
by
sales
of
its
line-up
of
fast-growing
prescription
drugs
,
including
its
anti-cholesterol
drug
,
Mevacor
;
a
high
blood
pressure
medicine
,
Vasotec
;
Primaxin
,
an
antibiotic
,
and
Pepcid
,
an
anti-ulcer
medication
.

Profit
climbed
even
though
Merck
's
sales
were
reduced
by
``
one
to
three
percentage
points
''
as
a
result
of
the
strong
dollar
,
Mr.
Sweig
said
.

In
the
third
quarter
of
1988
,
Merck
earned
$
311.8
million
,
or
79
cents
a
share
.

In
Rahway
,
N.J.
,
a
Merck
spokesman
said
the
company
does
n't
make
earnings
projections
.

Mr.
Sweig
said
he
estimated
that
Lilly
's
earnings
for
the
quarter
jumped
about
20
%
,
largely
because
of
the
performance
of
its
new
anti-depressant
Prozac
.

The
drug
,
introduced
last
year
,
is
expected
to
generate
sales
of
about
$
300
million
this
year
.

``
It
's
turning
out
to
be
a
real
blockbuster
,
''
Mr.
Sweig
said
.

In
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
Lilly
earned
$
171.4
million
,
or
$
1.20
a
share
.

In
Indianapolis
,
Lilly
declined
comment
.

Several
analysts
said
they
expected
Warner-Lambert
's
profit
also
to
increase
by
more
than
20
%
from
$
87.7
million
,
or
$
1.25
a
share
,
it
reported
in
the
like
period
last
year
.

The
company
is
praised
by
analysts
for
sharply
lowering
its
costs
in
recent
years
and
shedding
numerous
companies
with
low
profit
margins
.

The
company
's
lean
operation
,
analysts
said
,
allowed
sharp-rising
sales
from
its
cholesterol
drug
,
Lopid
,
to
power
earnings
growth
.

Lopid
sales
are
expected
to
be
about
$
300
million
this
year
,
up
from
$
190
million
in
1988
.

In
Morris
Plains
,
N.J.
,
a
spokesman
for
the
company
said
the
analysts
'
projections
are
``
in
the
ballpark
.

''
Squibb
's
profit
,
estimated
by
analysts
to
be
about
18
%
above
the
$
123
million
,
or
$
1.25
a
share
,
it
earned
in
the
third
quarter
of
1988
,
was
the
result
of
especially
strong
sales
of
its
Capoten
drug
for
treating
high
blood
pressure
and
other
heart
disease
.

The
company
was
officially
merged
with
Bristol-Myers
Co.
earlier
this
month
.

Bristol-Myers
declined
to
comment
.

Mr.
Riccardo
of
Bear
Stearns
said
that
Schering-Plough
Corp.
's
expected
profit
rise
of
about
18
%
to
20
%
,
and
Bristol-Meyers
's
expected
profit
increase
of
about
13
%
are
largely
because
``
those
companies
are
really
managed
well
.

''
ScheringPlough
earned
$
94.4
million
,
or
84
cents
a
share
,
while
Bristol-Myers
earned
$
232.3
million
,
or
81
cents
a
share
,
in
the
like
period
a
year
earlier
.

In
Madison
,
N.J.
,
a
spokesman
for
Schering-Plough
said
the
company
has
``
no
problems
''
with
the
average
estimate
by
a
analysts
that
third-quarter
earnings
per
share
rose
by
about
19
%
,
to
$
1
.

The
company
expects
to
achieve
the
20
%
increase
in
full-year
earnings
per
share
,
as
it
projected
in
the
spring
,
the
spokesman
said
.

Meanwhile
,
analysts
said
Pfizer
's
recent
string
of
lackluster
quarterly
performances
continued
,
as
earnings
in
the
quarter
were
expected
to
decline
by
about
5
%
.

Sales
of
Pfizer
's
important
drugs
,
Feldene
for
treating
arthritis
,
and
Procardia
,
a
heart
medicine
,
have
shrunk
because
of
increased
competition
.

``
The
(
strong
)
dollar
hurt
Pfizer
a
lot
,
too
,
''
Mr.
Sweig
said
.

In
the
third
quarter
last
year
,
Pfizer
earned
$
216.8
million
,
or
$
1.29
a
share
.

In
New
York
,
the
company
declined
comment
.

Analysts
said
they
expected
Upjohn
's
profit
to
be
flat
or
rise
by
only
about
2
%
to
4
%
as
compared
with
$
89.6
million
,
or
49
cents
a
share
,
it
earned
a
year
ago
.

Upjohn
's
biggest-selling
drugs
are
Xanax
,
a
tranquilizer
,
and
Halcion
,
a
sedative
.

Sales
of
both
drugs
have
been
hurt
by
new
state
laws
restricting
the
prescriptions
of
certain
tranquilizing
medicines
and
adverse
publicity
about
the
excessive
use
of
the
drugs
.

Also
,
the
company
's
hair-growing
drug
,
Rogaine
,
is
selling
well
--
at
about
$
125
million
for
the
year
,
but
the
company
's
profit
from
the
drug
has
been
reduced
by
Upjohn
's
expensive
print
and
television
campaigns
for
advertising
,
analysts
said
.

In
Kalamazoo
,
Mich.
,
Upjohn
declined
comment
.

Amid
a
crowd
of
crashing
stocks
,
Relational
Technology
Inc.
's
stock
fell
particularly
hard
Friday
,
dropping
23
%
because
its
problems
were
compounded
by
disclosure
of
an
unexpected
loss
for
its
fiscal
first
quarter
.

The
database
software
company
said
it
expects
a
$
2
million
net
loss
for
the
fiscal
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
.

It
said
analysts
had
been
expecting
a
small
profit
for
the
period
.

Revenue
is
expected
to
be
``
up
modestly
''
from
the
$
26.5
million
reported
a
year
ago
.

Relational
Technology
reported
net
income
of
$
1.5
million
,
or
12
cents
a
share
,
in
the
year-earlier
period
.

``
While
our
international
operations
showed
strong
growth
,
our
domestic
business
was
substantially
below
expectations
,
''
said
Paul
Newton
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
.

A
spokesman
said
the
company
's
first
quarter
is
historically
soft
,
and
computer
companies
in
general
are
experiencing
slower
sales
.

Mr.
Newton
said
he
accepted
the
resignation
of
Thomas
Wilson
,
vice
president
of
corporate
sales
,
and
that
his
marketing
responsibilities
have
been
reassigned
.

The
company
said
Mr.
Wilson
's
resignation
was
n't
related
to
the
sales
shortfall
.

Relational
Technology
went
public
in
May
1988
at
$
14
a
share
.

It
fell
$
1.875
a
share
Friday
,
to
$
6.25
,
a
new
low
,
in
over-the-counter
trading
.

Its
high
for
the
past
year
was
$
16.375
a
share
.

In
the
previous
quarter
,
the
company
earned
$
4.5
million
,
or
37
cents
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
47.2
million
.

The
Bronx
has
a
wonderful
botanical
garden
,
a
great
zoo
,
its
own
charming
Little
Italy
(
on
Arthur
Avenue
)
and
,
of
course
,
the
Yankees
.

However
,
most
people
,
having
been
subjected
to
news
footage
of
the
devastated
South
Bronx
,
look
at
the
borough
the
way
Tom
Wolfe
's
Sherman
McCoy
did
in
``
Bonfire
of
the
Vanities
''
--
as
a
wrong
turn
into
hell
.

But
Laura
Cunningham
's
Bronx
,
her
childhood
Bronx
of
the
'50s
,
is
something
else
altogether
.

In
a
lovely
,
novelistic
memoir
,
``
Sleeping
Arrangements
''
(
Knopf
,
195
pages
,
$
18.95
)
,
she
remembers
an
exotic
playground
,
peopled
mainly
by
Jewish
eccentrics
and
the
occasional
Catholic
(
real
oddballs
like
her
sexpot
friend
,
the
hell-kitten
Diana
,
age
five
)
.

Ms.
Cunningham
,
a
novelist
and
playwright
,
has
a
vivid
and
dramatically
outsized
sense
of
recall
.

She
transforms
her
``
Bronx
of
the
emotions
,
a
place
where
the
flats
of
mediocrity
are
only
relieved
by
steep
descents
into
hysteria
''
into
the
``
Babylonian
Bronx
,
''
a
world
simmering
with
sex
and
death
and
intrigue
.

In
the
Babylonian
Bronx
,
Jewish
working-class
people
lived
in
drab
,
Soviet-style
buildings
``
glamorized
''
with
names
like
AnaMor
Towers
(
after
owners
Anna
and
Morris
Snezak
)
,
whose
lobbies
and
hallways
were
decorated
with
murals
of
ancient
Syrians
and
Greeks
,
friezes
of
Pompeii
.

For
Ms.
Cunningham
the
architectural
discombobulation
matched
the
discrepancy
she
felt
living
in
the
AnaMor
Towers
as
a
little
girl
:
``
...
outwardly
ordinary
,
inwardly
ornate
,
owing
all
inspiration
to
heathen
cultures
.

''
Sharp-witted
and
funny
but
never
mean
,
she
's
a
memorialist
a
bit
like
Truman
Capote
,
if
he
'd
been
Jewish
and
female
and
less
bitchy
.

Little
Lily
,
as
Ms.
Cunningham
calls
herself
in
the
book
,
really
was
n't
ordinary
.

She
was
raised
,
for
the
first
eight
years
,
by
her
mother
,
Rosie
,
whom
she
remembers
as
a
loving
liar
,
who
realigned
history
to
explain
why
Lily
's
father
did
n't
live
with
them
.

Rosie
reinvented
this
man
,
who
may
or
may
not
have
known
about
his
child
,
as
a
war
hero
for
Lily
's
benefit
.

Rosie
died
young
and
Lily
has
remembered
her
as
a
romantic
figure
,
who
did
n't
interfere
much
with
her
child
's
education
on
the
streets
.

The
games
Bronx
children
played
(
holding
kids
down
and
stripping
them
,
for
example
)
seem
tame
by
today
's
crack
standards
,
but
Ms.
Cunningham
makes
it
all
sound
like
a
great
adventure
.

``
Without
official
knowledge
of
sex
or
death
,
we
flirted
with
both
,
''
she
writes
.

She
analyzed
families
by
their
sleeping
arrangements
.

Her
friend
Susan
,
whose
parents
kept
reminding
her
she
was
unwanted
,
slept
on
a
narrow
bed
wedged
into
her
parents
'
bedroom
,
as
though
she
were
a
temporary
visitor
.

Her
friend
Diana
's
father
was
a
professional
thief
;
they
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
bedrooms
at
all
.

Maybe
Lily
became
so
obsessed
with
where
people
slept
and
how
because
her
own
arrangements
kept
shifting
.

When
Rosie
died
,
her
uncles
moved
in
--
and
let
her
make
the
sleeping
and
other
household
arrangements
.

They
painted
the
apartment
orange
,
pink
and
white
,
according
to
her
instructions
.

With
loving
detail
she
recalls
her
Uncle
Gabe
,
an
Orthodox
Jew
and
song
lyricist
(
who
rhymed
river
with
liver
in
a
love
song
)
;
and
Uncle
Len
,
a
mysterious
part-time
investigator
who
looked
like
Lincoln
and
carried
a
change
of
clothing
in
a
Manila
envelope
,
like
an
``
undercover
President
on
a
good-will
mission
.

''
They
came
by
their
strangeness
honestly
.

Lily
's
grandmother
,
no
cookie
baker
,
excised
the
heads
of
disliked
relatives
from
the
family
album
,
and
lugged
around
her
perennial
work-in-progress
,
``
Philosophy
for
Women
.

''
The
book
loses
some
momentum
toward
the
end
,
when
Lily
becomes
more
preoccupied
with
dating
boys
and
less
with
her
delightfully
weird
family
.

For
the
most
part
,
though
,
there
's
much
pleasure
in
her
saucy
,
poignant
probe
into
the
mysteries
of
the
Babylonian
Bronx
.

The
Bronx
also
figures
in
Bruce
Jay
Friedman
's
latest
novel
,
which
flashes
back
to
the
New
York
of
the
'50s
.

But
both
the
past
and
present
worlds
of
``
The
Current
Climate
''
(
Atlantic
Monthly
Press
,
200
pages
,
$
18.95
)
feel
cramped
and
static
.

For
his
sixth
novel
,
Mr.
Friedman
tried
to
resuscitate
the
protagonist
of
his
1972
work
,
``
About
Harry
Towns
.

''
Harry
is
now
a
57-year-old
writer
,
whose
continuing
flirtation
with
drugs
and
marginal
types
in
Hollywood
and
New
York
seems
quaintly
out-of-synch
.

Harry
fondly
remembers
the
``
old
''
days
of
the
early
'70s
,
when
people
like
his
friend
Travis
would
take
a
psychiatrist
on
a
date
to
analyze
what
Travis
was
doing
wrong
.

``
An
L.A.
solution
,
''
explains
Mr.
Friedman
.

Line
by
line
Mr.
Friedman
's
weary
cynicism
can
be
amusing
,
especially
when
he
's
riffing
on
the
Hollywood
social
scheme
--
the
way
people
size
each
other
up
,
immediately
canceling
the
desperate
ones
who
merely
almost
made
it
.

Harry
has
avoided
all
that
by
living
in
a
Long
Island
suburb
with
his
wife
,
who
's
so
addicted
to
soap
operas
and
mystery
novels
she
barely
seems
to
notice
when
her
husband
disappears
for
drug-seeking
forays
into
Manhattan
.

But
it
does
n't
take
too
many
lines
to
figure
Harry
out
.

He
's
a
bore
.

Gulf
Resources
&
Chemical
Corp.
said
it
agreed
to
pay
$
1.5
million
as
part
of
an
accord
with
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
regarding
an
environmental
cleanup
of
a
defunct
smelter
the
company
formerly
operated
in
Idaho
.

In
1984
the
EPA
notified
Gulf
Resources
,
which
was
a
part-owner
of
the
smelter
,
that
it
was
potentially
liable
for
sharing
cleanup
costs
at
the
site
under
the
federal
Superfund
program
.

The
21-square-mile
area
is
contaminated
with
lead
,
zinc
and
other
metals
.

Gulf
Resources
earlier
this
year
proposed
a
reorganization
plan
that
would
make
it
a
unit
of
a
Bermuda
concern
,
potentially
exempting
it
from
liability
for
the
smelter
's
cleanup
costs
.

The
company
said
that
as
part
of
its
agreement
with
the
EPA
,
it
``
made
certain
voluntary
undertakings
with
respect
to
intercorporate
transactions
entered
into
after
the
reorganization
.

''
The
company
,
which
issued
a
statement
on
the
agreement
late
Friday
,
said
that
$
1
million
of
the
payment
was
previously
provided
for
in
its
financial
statements
and
that
$
500,000
will
be
recognized
in
its
1989
third-quarter
statement
.

The
agreement
and
consent
decree
are
subject
to
court
approval
,
the
company
said
.

Gulf
Resources
added
that
it
``
will
seek
to
recover
equitable
contribution
from
others
for
both
the
amount
of
the
settlement
and
any
other
liabilities
it
may
incur
under
the
Superfund
law
.

''
Under
the
agreement
,
Gulf
must
give
the
U.S.
government
45
days
'
advance
written
notice
before
issuing
any
dividends
on
common
stock
.

The
company
's
net
worth
can
not
fall
below
$
185
million
after
the
dividends
are
issued
.

``
The
terms
of
that
agreement
only
become
effective
the
date
of
Gulf
's
reorganization
,
which
we
anticipate
will
occur
sometime
in
early
1990
,
''
said
Lawrence
R.
Mehl
,
Gulf
's
general
counsel
.

In
addition
,
Gulf
must
give
the
government
20
days
'
advance
written
notice
of
any
loans
exceeding
$
50
million
that
are
made
to
the
Bermuda-based
holding
company
.

Gulf
's
net
worth
after
those
transaction
must
be
at
least
$
150
million
.

Separately
,
the
company
said
it
expects
to
hold
a
special
meeting
for
shareholders
in
early
1990
to
vote
on
its
proposed
reorganization
.

Many
of
the
nation
's
highest-ranking
executives
saluted
Friday
's
market
plunge
as
an
overdue
comeuppance
for
speculators
and
takeover
players
.

Assuming
that
the
market
does
n't
head
into
a
bottomless
free
fall
,
some
executives
think
Friday
's
action
could
prove
a
harbinger
of
good
news
--
as
a
sign
that
the
leveraged
buy-out
and
takeover
frenzy
of
recent
years
may
be
abating
.

``
This
is
a
reaction
to
artificial
LBO
valuations
,
rather
than
to
any
fundamentals
,
''
said
John
Young
,
chairman
of
Hewlett-Packard
Co.
,
whose
shares
dropped
$
3.125
to
$
48.125
.

``
If
we
get
rid
of
a
lot
of
that
nonsense
,
it
will
be
a
big
plus
.

''
A
few
of
the
executives
here
for
the
fall
meeting
of
the
Business
Council
,
a
group
that
meets
to
discuss
national
issues
,
were
only
too
happy
to
personalize
their
criticism
.

``
People
wish
the
government
would
do
something
about
leveraged
buy-outs
,
do
something
about
takeovers
,
do
something
about
Donald
Trump
,
''
said
Rand
Araskog
,
chairman
of
ITT
Corp.
,
whose
stock
dropped
$
3.375
.

``
Where
's
the
leadership
?
Where
's
the
guy
who
can
say
:
`
Enough
is
enough
'
''
?
The
executives
were
remarkably
unperturbed
by
the
plunge
even
though
it
lopped
billions
of
dollars
off
the
value
of
their
companies
--
and
millions
off
their
personal
fortunes
.

``
I
'm
not
going
to
worry
about
one
day
's
decline
,
''
said
Kenneth
Olsen
,
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
president
,
who
was
leisurely
strolling
through
the
bright
orange
and
yellow
leaves
of
the
mountains
here
after
his
company
's
shares
plunged
$
5.75
to
close
at
$
86.50
.

``
I
did
n't
bother
calling
anybody
;
I
did
n't
even
turn
on
TV
.

''
``
There
has
n't
been
any
fundamental
change
in
the
economy
,
''
added
John
Smale
,
whose
Procter
&
Gamble
Co.
took
an
$
8.75
slide
to
close
at
$
120.75
.

``
The
fact
that
this
happened
two
years
ago
and
there
was
a
recovery
gives
people
some
comfort
that
this
wo
n't
be
a
problem
.

''
Of
course
,
established
corporate
managements
often
tend
to
applaud
the
setbacks
of
stock
speculators
and
takeover
artists
.

Indeed
,
one
chief
executive
who
was
downright
delighted
by
Friday
's
events
was
Robert
Crandall
,
chairman
of
AMR
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
American
Airlines
and
the
target
of
a
takeover
offer
by
Mr.
Trump
.

Asked
whether
Friday
's
action
could
help
him
avoid
being
Trumped
by
the
New
York
real
estate
magnate
,
Mr.
Crandall
smiled
broadly
and
said
:
``
No
comment
.

''
On
Friday
morning
,
before
the
market
's
sell-off
,
the
business
leaders
issued
a
report
predicting
the
economy
would
grow
at
roughly
an
inflation-adjusted
2
%
annual
rate
,
through
next
year
,
then
accelerate
anew
in
1991
.

Of
the
19
economists
who
worked
on
the
Business
Council
forecast
,
only
two
projected
periods
of
decline
in
the
nation
's
output
over
the
next
two
years
,
and
in
``
both
instances
the
declines
are
too
modest
to
warrant
the
phrase
recession
,
''
said
Lewis
Preston
,
chairman
of
J.P.
Morgan
&
Co.
and
vice
chairman
of
the
Business
Council
.

The
real
estate
slump
that
's
pushing
down
the
price
of
New
York
office
space
and
housing
is
also
affecting
the
city
's
retail
real
estate
market
.

In
Manhattan
,
once-desirable
store
sites
sit
vacant
and
newly
constructed
space
has
been
slow
to
fill
.

Retail
real
estate
brokers
say
tenants
are
reluctant
to
sign
leases
because
of
uncertainty
about
the
local
economy
,
turmoil
in
their
own
industries
and
a
belief
that
rents
have
not
yet
hit
bottom
.

``
There
is
an
unbelievable
amount
of
space
available
,
''
says
Faith
Consolo
,
senior
vice
president
at
Garrick-Aug
Associates
Store
Leasing
Inc
.

There
are
about
2,000
stores
for
rent
,
up
from
a
more
typical
range
of
1,200
to
1,500
.

``
This
further
confuses
retailers
,
''
she
says
.

``
They
wonder
should
they
sign
a
lease
if
prices
are
still
coming
down
?
Is
this
the
wrong
time
to
open
a
store
?
Who
is
going
to
be
in
the
space
next
door
?
''
In
addition
,
Ms.
Consolo
says
,
tenants
usually
can
negotiate
to
pay
rents
that
are
about
one-quarter
lower
than
landlords
'
initial
asking
price
.

A
handful
of
hot
retail
locations
,
such
as
the
57th
Street
and
Madison
and
Fifth
Avenue
areas
,
have
been
able
to
sustain
what
many
see
as
astronomical
rents
.

And
,
in
some
neighborhoods
,
rents
have
merely
hit
a
plateau
.

But
on
average
,
Manhattan
retail
rents
have
dropped
10
%
to
15
%
in
the
past
six
months
alone
,
experts
say
.

That
follows
a
more
subtle
decline
in
the
prior
six
months
,
after
Manhattan
rents
had
run
up
rapidly
since
1986
.

The
same
factors
limiting
demand
for
office
space
have
affected
retailing
.

``
As
businesses
contract
or
depart
,
the
number
of
employees
who
might
use
retail
services
shrinks
,
''
says
Edward
A.
Friedman
,
senior
vice
president
of
Helmsley
Spear
Inc
.

He
says
financial
problems
plaguing
electronics
,
fur
and
furniture
companies
--
key
categories
in
the
local
retail
economy
--
have
further
deflated
the
market
.

Hardest
hit
are
what
he
calls
``
secondary
''
sites
that
primarily
serve
neighborhood
residents
.

In
these
locations
,
Mr.
Friedman
says
,
``
Retailers
are
increasingly
cautious
about
expanding
and
rents
have
remained
steady
or
in
some
cases
have
declined
.

''
Weakness
in
the
restaurant
industry
,
which
is
leaving
retail
space
vacant
,
exacerbates
the
problem
for
landlords
.

It
is
also
no
comfort
to
landlords
and
small
New
York
retailers
when
the
future
of
larger
department
stores
,
which
anchor
retail
neighborhoods
,
are
in
doubt
.

Hooker
Corp.
,
parent
of
Bonwit
Teller
and
B.
Altman
's
,
is
mired
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
and
Bloomingdale
's
is
for
sale
by
its
owner
,
Campeau
Corp
.

The
trend
toward
lower
rents
may
seem
surprising
given
that
some
communities
in
New
York
are
bemoaning
the
loss
of
favorite
local
businesses
to
high
rents
.

But
,
despite
the
recent
softening
,
for
many
of
these
retailers
there
's
still
been
too
big
a
jump
from
the
rental
rates
of
the
late
1970s
,
when
their
leases
were
signed
.

Certainly
,
the
recent
drop
in
prices
does
n't
mean
Manhattan
comes
cheap
.

New
York
retail
rents
still
run
well
above
the
going
rate
in
other
U.S.
cities
.

Madison
and
Fifth
Avenues
and
East
57th
Street
can
command
rents
of
up
to
$
500
a
square
foot
,
and
$
250
is
not
uncommon
.

The
thriving
34th
Street
area
offers
rents
of
about
$
100
a
square
foot
,
as
do
up-and-coming
locations
along
lower
Fifth
Avenue
.

By
contrast
,
rentals
in
the
best
retail
locations
in
Boston
,
San
Francisco
and
Chicago
rarely
top
$
100
a
square
foot
.

And
rents
on
Beverly
Hills
'
Rodeo
Drive
generally
do
n't
exceed
about
$
125
a
square
foot
.

When
Justice
William
Brennan
marks
the
start
of
his
34th
year
on
the
Supreme
Court
today
,
the
occasion
will
differ
sharply
from
previous
anniversaries
of
his
tenure
.

For
the
first
time
,
the
83-year-old
justice
finds
his
influence
almost
exclusively
in
dissent
,
rather
than
as
a
force
in
the
high
court
's
majority
.

This
role
reversal
holds
true
,
as
well
,
for
his
three
liberal
and
moderate
allies
,
Justices
Thurgood
Marshall
,
Harry
Blackmun
and
John
Stevens
.

But
are
these
four
players
,
three
of
them
in
their
80s
,
ready
to
assume
a
different
role
after
88
years
,
collectively
,
of
service
on
the
high
court
?
Every
indication
is
that
the
four
are
prepared
to
accept
this
new
role
,
and
the
frustrations
that
go
with
it
,
but
in
different
ways
.

Justices
Brennan
and
Stevens
appear
philosophical
about
it
;
Justices
Marshall
and
Blackmun
appear
fighting
mad
.

The
four
justices
are
no
newcomers
to
dissent
,
often
joining
forces
in
the
past
decade
to
criticize
the
court
's
conservative
drift
.

But
always
,
in
years
past
,
they
have
bucked
the
trend
and
have
been
able
to
pick
up
a
fifth
vote
to
eke
out
a
number
of
major
victories
in
civil
rights
and
liberties
cases
.

Now
,
however
,
as
the
court
's
new
five-member
conservative
majority
continues
to
solidify
,
victories
for
the
liberals
are
rare
.

The
change
is
most
dramatic
for
Justice
Brennan
,
the
last
survivor
of
the
mid-1960s
liberal
majority
under
Chief
Justice
Earl
Warren
.

In
the
seven
Supreme
Court
terms
from
the
fall
of
1962
through
the
spring
of
1967
,
the
height
of
the
Warren
Court
's
power
,
Justice
Brennan
cast
only
25
dissenting
votes
in
555
cases
decided
by
the
court
.

Last
term
alone
he
cast
52
dissenting
votes
in
133
decisions
,
with
the
contentious
flag-burning
ruling
as
his
only
big
victory
.

But
Justice
Brennan
foresaw
his
new
role
,
strongly
defending
the
importance
of
dissents
in
a
1985
speech
.

``
Each
time
the
court
revisits
an
issue
,
the
justices
will
be
forced
by
a
dissent
to
reconsider
the
fundamental
questions
and
to
rethink
the
result
,
''
he
said
.

Moreover
,
in
recent
months
he
has
said
that
when
he
was
on
the
winning
side
in
the
1960s
,
he
knew
that
the
tables
might
turn
in
the
future
.

He
has
said
that
he
now
knows
how
Justice
John
Harlan
felt
,
a
reference
to
the
late
conservative
justice
who
was
the
most
frequent
dissenter
from
the
Warren
Court
's
opinions
.

Associates
of
81-year-old
Justice
Marshall
say
he
was
``
depressed
''
about
the
court
's
direction
last
spring
,
but
is
feisty
about
his
role
and
determined
to
speak
out
against
the
court
's
cutbacks
in
civil
rights
.

``
We
could
sweep
it
under
the
rug
and
hide
it
,
but
I
'm
not
going
to
do
it
,
''
he
said
in
a
speech
last
month
.

He
,
like
Justice
Brennan
,
considers
dissents
highly
important
for
the
future
,
a
point
that
has
n't
escaped
legal
scholars
.

Harvard
Law
School
Professor
Laurence
Tribe
says
there
is
a
``
generation-skipping
''
flavor
to
current
dissents
.

The
dissenters
in
the
Warren
Court
,
he
says
,
appeared
to
be
writing
for
the
short-term
,
suggesting
that
the
court
's
direction
might
change
soon
.

``
Brennan
and
Marshall
are
speaking
in
their
dissents
to
a
more
distant
future
,
''
he
says
.

Justice
Blackmun
,
who
will
turn
81
next
month
,
also
seems
feisty
about
his
new
role
.

Associates
say
he
takes
some
defeats
more
personally
than
his
colleagues
,
especially
attempts
to
curtail
the
right
to
abortion
first
recognized
in
his
1973
opinion
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
.

Friends
and
associates
who
saw
Justice
Blackmun
during
the
summer
said
he
was
no
more
discouraged
about
the
court
than
in
recent
years
.

And
his
outlook
improved
after
successful
cataract
surgery
in
August
.

But
his
level
of
frustration
showed
in
a
recent
,
impassioned
speech
to
a
group
of
hundreds
of
lawyers
in
Chicago
.

He
concluded
his
remarks
by
quoting
,
emotionally
and
at
some
length
,
according
to
those
present
,
the
late
Martin
Luther
King
's
famous
``
I
Have
a
Dream
''
speech
from
the
1963
March
on
Washington
.

Justice
Stevens
,
69
,
is
probably
the
most
philosophical
of
the
dissenters
about
his
role
,
in
part
because
he
may
be
the
least
liberal
of
the
four
,
but
also
because
he
enjoys
the
intellectual
challenge
of
arguing
with
the
majority
more
than
the
others
.

If
the
role
these
four
dissenters
are
assuming
is
a
familiar
one
in
modern
Supreme
Court
history
,
it
also
differs
in
an
important
way
from
recent
history
,
court
watchers
say
.

``
The
dissenters
of
the
Warren
Court
were
often
defending
a
legal
legacy
that
they
inherited
,
''
says
Prof.
A.E.
Dick
Howard
of
the
University
of
Virginia
Law
School
,
``
but
the
dissenters
today
are
defending
a
legacy
that
they
created
.

''
The
government
sold
the
deposits
of
four
savings-and-loan
institutions
,
in
its
first
wave
of
sales
of
big
,
sick
thrifts
,
but
low
bids
prevented
the
sale
of
a
fifth
.

The
four
S&Ls
were
sold
to
large
banks
,
as
was
the
case
with
most
of
the
28
previous
transactions
initiated
by
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
since
it
was
created
in
the
S&L
bailout
legislation
two
months
ago
.

Two
of
the
four
big
thrifts
were
sold
to
NCNB
Corp.
,
Charlotte
,
N.C.
,
which
has
aggressively
expanded
its
markets
,
particularly
in
Texas
and
Florida
.

A
Canadian
bank
bought
another
thrift
,
in
the
first
RTC
transaction
with
a
foreign
bank
.

Under
these
deals
,
the
RTC
sells
just
the
deposits
and
the
healthy
assets
.

These
``
clean-bank
''
transactions
leave
the
bulk
of
bad
assets
,
mostly
real
estate
,
with
the
government
,
to
be
sold
later
.

In
these
four
,
for
instance
,
the
RTC
is
stuck
with
$
4.51
billion
in
bad
assets
.

Acquirers
paid
premiums
ranging
from
1.5
%
to
3.7
%
for
the
deposits
and
branch
systems
,
roughly
in
line
with
what
analysts
were
expecting
.

The
buyers
will
also
be
locked
into
deposit
rates
for
just
two
weeks
,
as
has
been
the
case
with
previous
deals
.

After
that
,
the
buyers
may
repudiate
the
rates
paid
by
the
former
thrifts
.

But
it
's
uncertain
whether
these
institutions
will
take
those
steps
.

NCNB
,
for
example
,
has
been
one
of
the
highest
rate
payers
in
the
Texas
market
,
and
in
Florida
,
rates
are
especially
sensitive
in
retirement
communities
.

The
RTC
had
previously
targeted
five
thrifts
for
quick
sales
in
order
to
spend
cash
by
certain
budgetary
deadlines
,
but
the
delays
illustrate
the
tough
chore
facing
the
agency
.

``
These
thrifts
are
beached
whales
,
''
said
Bert
Ely
,
an
industry
consultant
based
in
Alexandria
,
Va
.

For
example
,
the
delay
in
selling
People
's
Heritage
Savings
,
Salina
,
Kan.
,
with
$
1.7
billion
in
assets
,
has
forced
the
RTC
to
consider
selling
off
the
thrift
branch-by-branch
,
instead
of
as
a
whole
institution
.

NCNB
continued
its
foray
into
the
Florida
and
Texas
markets
.

NCNB
will
acquire
University
Federal
Savings
Association
,
Houston
,
which
had
assets
of
$
2.8
billion
.

NCNB
Texas
National
Bank
will
pay
the
RTC
a
premium
of
$
129
million
for
$
3.5
billion
in
deposits
.

As
a
measure
of
the
depths
to
which
the
Texas
real
estate
market
has
sunk
,
the
RTC
will
pay
$
3.8
billion
to
NCNB
to
take
$
750
million
of
bad
assets
.

NCNB
also
acquired
Freedom
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
which
had
total
assets
of
$
900
million
.

NCNB
will
pay
the
RTC
a
premium
of
$
40.4
million
for
$
1.1
billion
in
deposits
.

NCNB
will
also
acquire
$
266
million
of
Freedom
's
assets
from
the
RTC
,
which
will
require
$
875
million
in
assistance
.

Meridian
Bancorp
Inc.
,
Reading
,
Pa.
,
will
acquire
Hill
Financial
Savings
Association
,
Red
Hill
,
Pa.
,
which
had
$
2.3

assets
.

Meridian
will
pay
a
premium
of
$
30.5

assume
$
2

Time
magazine
,
in
a
move
to
reduce
the
costs
of
wooing
new
subscribers
,
is
lowering
its
circulation
guarantee
to
advertisers
for
the
second
consecutive
year
,
increasing
its
subscription
rates
and
cutting
back
on
merchandise
giveaways
.

In
an
announcement
to
its
staff
last
week
,
executives
at
Time
Warner
Inc.
's
weekly
magazine
said
Time
will
``
dramatically
de-emphasize
''
its
use
of
electronic
giveaways
such
as
telephones
in
television
subscription
drives
;
cut
the
circulation
it
guarantees
advertisers
by
300,000
,
to
four
million
;
and
increase
the
cost
of
its
annual
subscription
rate
by
about
$
4
to
$
55
.

In
a
related
development
,
the
news-weekly
,
for
the
fourth
year
in
a
row
,
said
it
wo
n't
increase
its
advertising
rates
in
1990
;
a
full
,
four-color
page
in
the
magazine
costs
about
$
120,000
.

However
,
because
the
guaranteed
circulation
base
is
being
lowered
,
ad
rates
will
be
effectively
7.5
%
higher
per
subscriber
,
according
to
Richard
Heinemann
,
Time
associate
publisher
.

Time
is
following
the
course
of
some
other
mass-circulation
magazines
that
in
recent
years
have
challenged
the
publishing
myth
that
maintaining
artificially
high
,
and
expensive
,
circulations
is
the
way
to
draw
advertisers
.

In
recent
years
,
Reader
's
Digest
,
New
York
Times
Co.
's
McCall
's
,
and
most
recently
News
Corp.
's
TV
Guide
,
have
cut
their
massive
circulation
rate
bases
to
eliminate
marginal
circulation
and
hold
down
rates
for
advertisers
.

Deep
discounts
in
subscriptions
and
offers
of
free
clock
radios
and
watches
have
become
accepted
forms
of
attracting
new
subscribers
in
the
hyper-competitive
world
of
magazine
news-weeklies
.

But
Time
,
as
part
of
the
more
cost-conscious
Time
Warner
,
wants
to
wean
itself
away
from
expensive
gimmicks
.

Besides
,
Time
executives
think
selling
a
news
magazine
with
a
clock
radio
is
tacky
.

``
Giveaways
just
give
people
the
wrong
image
,
''
said
Mr.
Heinemann
.

``
That
perception
takes
the
focus
off
the
magazine
.

''
Time
magazine
executives
predictably
paint
the
circulation
cut
as
a
show
of
strength
and
actually
a
benefit
to
advertisers
.

``
What
we
are
doing
is
screening
out
the
readers
who
are
only
casually
related
to
the
magazine
and
do
n't
really
read
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Heinemann
.

``
We
are
trying
to
create
quality
and
involvement
.

''
However
,
Time
executives
used
the
same
explanation
when
in
October
1988
the
magazine
cut
its
guaranteed
circulation
from
4.6
million
to
4.3
million
.

And
Time
's
paid
circulation
,
according
to
Audit
Bureau
of
Circulations
,
dropped
7.3
%
to
4,393,237
in
the
six
months
ended
June
30
,
1989
.

Still
,
Time
's
move
is
being
received
well
,
once
again
.

``
It
's
terrific
for
advertisers
to
know
the
reader
will
be
paying
more
,
''
said
Michael
Drexler
,
national
media
director
at
Bozell
Inc.
ad
agency
.

``
A
few
drops
in
circulation
are
of
no
consequence
.

It
's
not
a
show
of
weakness
;
they
are
improving
the
quality
of
circulation
while
insuring
their
profits
.

''
Mr.
Heinemann
said
the
changes
represent
a
new
focus
in
the
magazine
industry
:
a
magazine
's
net
revenue
per
subscriber
,
or
the
actual
revenue
from
subscribers
after
discounts
and
the
cost
of
premiums
have
been
stripped
away
.

``
The
question
is
how
much
are
we
getting
from
each
reader
,
''
said
Mr.
Heinemann
.

Time
's
rivals
news-weeklies
,
Washington
Post
Co.
's
Newsweek
and
U.S.
News
&
World
Report
,
are
less
reliant
on
electronic
giveaways
,
and
in
recent
years
both
have
been
increasing
their
circulation
rate
bases
.

Both
magazines
are
expected
to
announce
their
ad
rates
and
circulation
levels
for
1990
within
a
month
.

When
the
news
broke
of
an
attempted
coup
in
Panama
two
weeks
ago
,
Sen.
Christopher
Dodd
called
the
State
Department
for
a
briefing
.

``
They
said
,
`
follow
CNN
,
'
''
he
told
reporters
.

That
shows
how
far
Ted
Turner
's
Cable
News
Network
has
come
since
its
birth
nine
years
ago
,
when
it
was
considered
the
laughingstock
of
television
news
.

It
is
bigger
,
faster
and
more
profitable
than
the
news
divisions
of
any
of
the
three
major
broadcast
networks
.

Its
niche
as
the
``
network
of
record
''
during
major
crises
draws
elite
audiences
around
the
world
.

But
for
all
its
success
,
CNN
has
hit
a
plateau
.

Although
viewership
soars
when
big
news
breaks
,
it
ebbs
during
periods
of
calm
.

CNN
executives
worry
that
the
network
's
punchy
but
repetitive
news
format
may
be
getting
stale
and
wo
n't
keep
viewers
coming
back
as
the
alternatives
multiply
for
news
and
information
on
cable-TV
.

``
Just
the
fact
we
're
on
24
hours
is
no
longer
bulletin
,
''
says
Ed
Turner
,
CNN
's
executive
vice
president
,
news
gathering
(
and
no
relation
to
Ted
Turner
)
.

``
You
ca
n't
live
on
that
.

''
So
CNN
,
a
unit
of
Atlanta-based
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc.
,
is
trying
to
reposition
itself
as
a
primary
channel
,
or
what
people
in
the
television
industry
call
a
``
top
of
mind
''
network
.

Tonight
,
to
kick
off
the
effort
,
CNN
will
premiere
its
first
prime-time
newscast
in
years
,
an
hourlong
show
at
6
p.m
.

Eastern
time
to
air
head-to-head
against
the
network
newscasts
.

The
show
will
be
co-anchored
by
Bernard
Shaw
and
Catherine
Crier
,
a
34-year-old
former
Texas
judge
and
campus
beauty
queen
who
has
never
held
a
job
in
television
or
journalism
.

The
new
show
is
perhaps
the
boldest
in
a
number
of
steps
the
network
is
taking
to
build
audience
loyalty
by
shifting
away
from
its
current
format
toward
more
full-length
``
signature
''
programming
with
recognizable
stars
.

To
distinguish
itself
,
CNN
is
also
expanding
international
coverage
and
adding
a
second
global-news
program
.

It
is
paying
higher
salaries
--
after
years
of
scrimping
--
to
lure
and
keep
experienced
staffers
.

And
it
is
embarking
on
an
expensive
gamble
to
break
major
stories
with
a
large
investigative-reporting
team
.

``
The
next
stage
is
to
get
beyond
the
opinion
leaders
who
use
us
as
a
point
of
reference
to
become
a
point
of
reference
at
ordinary
dinner
tables
,
''
says
Jon
Petrovich
,
executive
vice
president
of
Headline
News
,
CNN
's
sister
network
.

But
that
wo
n't
be
easy
.

Networks
,
like
other
consumer
products
,
develop
images
in
peoples
'
minds
that
are
n't
easy
to
change
.

It
also
takes
money
that
CNN
has
been
reluctant
to
spend
to
make
programs
and
hire
talent
that
viewers
will
tune
in
specially
to
see
.

And
the
cable-TV
operators
--
CNN
's
distributors
and
part
owners
--
like
things
just
the
way
they
are
.

The
repositioning
bid
is
aimed
at
CNN
's
unsteady
viewership
--
and
what
may
happen
to
it
as
the
cable-TV
news
market
grows
more
competitive
.

Already
,
CNN
is
facing
stronger
competition
from
Financial
News
Network
Inc.
and
General
Electric
Co.
's
Consumer
News
and
Business
Channel
,
both
of
which
are
likely
to
pursue
more
general
news
in
the
future
.

In
addition
,
many
cable-TV
systems
themselves
are
airing
more
local
and
regional
news
programs
produced
by
local
broadcast
stations
.

CNN
wants
to
change
its
viewers
'
habits
.

Its
watchers
are
,
on
the
whole
,
a
disloyal
group
of
channel-zapping
``
grazers
''
and
news
junkies
,
who
spend
an
average
of
just
26
minutes
a
day
watching
CNN
,
according
to
audience
research
.

That
's
less
than
one-third
the
time
that
viewers
watch
the
major
broadcast
networks
.

The
brief
attention
viewers
give
CNN
could
put
it
at
a
disadvantage
as
ratings
data
,
and
advertising
,
become
more
important
to
cable-TV
channels
.

CNN
's
viewer
habits
have
been
molded
by
its
format
.

Its
strategy
in
the
past
has
been
to
serve
as
a
TV
wire
service
.

It
focused
on
building
up
its
news
bureaus
around
the
world
,
so
as
events
took
place
it
could
go
live
quicker
and
longer
than
other
networks
.

It
filled
its
daily
schedule
with
newscasts
called
``
Daybreak
,
''
``
Daywatch
,
''
``
Newsday
,
''
and
``
Newsnight
,
''
but
the
shows
varied
little
in
content
,
personality
or
look
.

Now
,
the
push
is
on
for
more-distinctive
shows
.

``
Our
goal
is
to
create
more
programs
with
an
individual
identity
,
''
says
Paul
Amos
,
CNN
executive
vice
president
for
programming
.

Accordingly
,
CNN
is
adding
a
world-affairs
show
in
the
morning
because
surveys
show
its
global-news
hour
in
the
afternoon
is
among
its
most
``
differentiated
''
programs
in
viewers
'
minds
,
says
Mr.
Amos
.

And
it
is
exploring
other
original
programs
,
similar
to
its
``
Larry
King
Live
''
and
``
Crossfire
''
talk
shows
,
which
executives
hope
will
keep
people
tuned
in
.

Then
there
's
``
The
World
Today
,
''
the
prime-time
newscast
featuring
Mr.
Shaw
and
Ms.
Crier
.

Until
now
,
CNN
has
featured
its
Hollywood
gossip
show
during
the
key
evening
period
.

But
70
%
of
the
cable-television-equipped
households
that
watch
news
do
so
between
6:30
p.m.
and
7
p.m.
,
the
network
discovered
,
so
CNN
wants
in
.

Mr.
Amos
says
the
Shaw-Crier
team
will
probably
do
two
live
interviews
a
day
,
with
most
of
the
program
,
at
least
for
now
,
appearing
similar
to
CNN
's
other
newcasts
.

Some
in
the
industry
are
skeptical
.

``
I
find
it
hard
to
conceive
of
people
switching
over
to
CNN
for
what
,
at
least
in
the
public
's
mind
,
is
the
same
news
,
''
says
Reuven
Frank
,
the
former
two-time
president
of
NBC
News
and
creator
of
the
Huntley-Brinkley
Report
.

The
evening
news
is
also
slated
as
CNN
's
stage
for
its
big
push
into
investigative
journalism
.

In
August
,
the
network
hired
award-winning
producer
Pamela
Hill
,
the
former
head
of
news
specials
at
ABC
.

She
's
assembling
a
staff
of
about
35
investigative
reporters
who
will
produce
weekly
,
in-depth
segments
,
with
an
eye
toward
breaking
big
stories
.

CNN
executives
hope
the
headlines
created
by
such
scoops
will
generate
excitement
for
its
``
branded
''
programs
,
in
the
way
``
60
Minutes
''
did
so
well
for
CBS
.

That
's
such
a
departure
from
the
past
that
many
in
the
industry
are
skeptical
CNN
will
follow
through
with
its
investigative
commitment
,
especially
after
it
sees
the
cost
of
producing
in-depth
pieces
.

``
They
've
never
shown
any
inclination
to
spend
money
on
production
,
''
says
Michael
Mosettig
,
a
senior
producer
with
MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour
,
who
notes
that
CNN
is
indispensable
to
his
job
.

The
network
's
salaries
have
always
ranged
far
below
industry
standards
,
resulting
in
a
less-experienced
work
force
.

CNN
recently
gave
most
employees
raises
of
as
much
as
15
%
,
but
they
're
still
drastically
underpaid
compared
with
the
networks
.

Says
Mr.
Mosettig
:
``
CNN
is
my
wire
service
;
they
're
on
top
of
everything
.

But
to
improve
,
they
've
really
got
to
make
the
investment
in
people
.

''
In
any
case
,
cable-TV-system
operators
have
reason
to
fear
any
tinkering
with
CNN
's
format
.

They
market
cable-TV
on
the
very
grazing
opportunities
CNN
seeks
to
discourage
.

``
We
would
obviously
be
upset
if
those
kinds
of
services
evolved
into
more
general-interest
,
long-format
programming
,
''
says
Robert
Stengel
,
senior
vice
president
,
programming
,
of
Continental
Cablevision
Inc.
,
which
holds
a
2
%
stake
in
Turner
Broadcasting

The
fundamental
rule
of
contract

applied
to
both
cases
was
that
courts
will
not
enforce
agreements
to
which
the
parties
did
not
intend
to
be

In
the
litigation
,
the

and

intended
to
be
bound
;
in

Phosphates
they
found
there
was
no

Admittedly
,
the
principle
in
the
cases
is
the
same
.

But
the
outcome

legal
dispute
almost
always
turns
on
the
facts
.

And
the
facts
,
as
found
by
the
various
courts
in
these
two
lawsuits
,
were
different
.

When
you
suggest
otherwise
,
you
leave
the

enter

orbit

speculation

of

withdrew
from

its

to
buy
five
Valley
Federal
branches
,
leaving
the
transaction
in
limbo
.

The
broken
purchase
appears
as
additional
evidence
of
trouble
at
Imperial
Corp.
,
whose
spokesman
said
the
company
withdrew
its
application
from
the
federal
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
because
of
an
informal
notice
that
Imperial
's
thrift
unit
failed
to
meet
Community
Reinvestment
Act
requirements
.

The
Community
Reinvestment
Act
requires
savings
and
loan
associations
to
lend
money
in
amounts
related
to
areas
where
deposits
are
received
.

The
transaction
,
announced
in
August
,
included
about
$
146
million
in
deposits
at
the
five
outlets
in
California
's
San
Joaquin
Valley
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
,
but
Valley
Federal
had
said
it
expected
to
post
a
modest
pretax
gain
and
to
save
about
$
2
million
in
operating
costs
annually
.

Valley
Federal
said
Friday
that
it
is
considering
whether
to
seek
another
buyer
for
the
branches
or
to
pursue
the
transaction
with
Imperial
Corp.
,
which
said
it
is
attempting

meet

claim
that
the

common-sense
ring
to
it
,
even
the
S&L
lawyers
concede
there
's
little
precedent
to
back
their
position
.

Still
,
one
federal
appeals
court
has
signaled
it
's
willing
to
entertain
the
notion
,
and
the
lawyers
have
renewed
their
arguments
in
Texas
and
eight
other
states
where
the
defense
is
permitted
under
state
law
.

The
dismissal
of
the
pending
suits
could
go
a
long
way
toward
clearing
court
dockets
in
Texas
and
reducing
the
FSLIC
's
massive
legal
bills
,
which
topped
$
73
million
last
year
.

The
S&L
lawyers
were
encouraged
last
month
by
an
appellate-court
ruling
in
two
cases
brought
against
defunct
Sunbelt
Savings
&
Loan
Association
of
Dallas
by
the
developers
of
the
Valley
Ranch
,
best
known
as
the
training
center
for
the
Dallas
Cowboys
football
team
.

Sunbelt
foreclosed
on
the
ranch
.

Sunbelt
and
the
FSLIC
argued
to
the
Fifth
U.S.
Circuit
Court
of
Appeals
``
that
there
will
never
be
any
assets
with
which
to
satisfy
a
judgment
against
Sunbelt
Savings
nor
any
means
to
collect
from
any
other
party
,
including
FSLIC
.

''
``
If
true
,
''
the
court
wrote
,
``
this
contention
would
justify
dismissal
of
these
actions
on
prudential
grounds
.

''
But
the
court
said
it
lacked
enough
financial
information
about
Sunbelt
and
the
FSLIC
and
sent
the
cases
back
to
federal
district
court
in
Dallas
.

Charles
Haworth
,
a
lawyer
for
Sunbelt
,
says
he
plans
to
file
a
brief
this
week
urging
the
district
judge
to
dismiss
the
suits
,
because
Sunbelt
's
liabilities
exceeded
its
assets
by
about
$
2
billion
when
federal
regulators
closed
it
in
August
1988
.

``
This
institution
is
just
brain
dead
,
''
says
Mr.
Haworth
,
a
partner
in
the
Dallas
office
of
Andrews
&
Kurth
,
a
Houston
law
firm
.

But
a
lawyer
for
Triland
Investment
Group
,
the
developer
of
Valley
Ranch
,
dismisses
such
arguments
as
a
``
defense
du
jour
.

''
Attorney
Richard
Jackson
of
Dallas
says
a
judgment
for
Triland
could
be
satisfied
in
ways
other
than
a
monetary
award
,
including
the
reversal
of
Sunbelt
's
foreclosure
on
Valley
Ranch
.

``
We
're
asking
the
court
for
a
number
of
things
he
can
grant
in
addition
to
the
thrill
of
victory
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
'd
take
the
Valley
Ranch
free
and
clear
as
a
booby
prize
.

''
Kenneth
J.
Thygerson
,
who
was
named
president
of
this
thrift
holding
company
in
August
,
resigned
,
citing
personal
reasons
.

Mr.
Thygerson
said
he
had
planned
to
travel
between
the
job
in
Denver
and
his
San
Diego
home
,
but
has
found
the
commute
too
difficult
to
continue
.

A
new
president
was
n't
named
.

SOUTH
AFRICA
FREED
the
ANC
's
Sisulu
and
seven
other
political
prisoners
.

Thousands
of
supporters
,
many
brandishing
flags
of
the
outlawed
African
National
Congress
,
gave
the
anti-apartheid
activists
a
tumultuous
reception
upon
their
return
to
black
townships
across
the
country
.

Most
of
those
freed
had
spent
at
least
25
years
in
prison
.

The
77-year-old
Sisulu
,
sentenced
to
life
in
1964
along
with
black
nationalist
Nelson
Mandela
for
plotting
to
overthrow
the
government
,
said
equality
for
blacks
in
South
Africa
was
in
reach
.

The
releases
,
announced
last
week
by
President
de
Klerk
,
were
viewed
as
Pretoria
's
tacit
legalization
of
the
ANC
.

Mandela
,
considered
the
most
prominent
leader
of
the
ANC
,
remains
in
prison
.

But
his
release
within
the
next
few
months
is
widely
expected
.

The
Soviet
Union
reported
that
thousands
of
tons
of
goods
needed
to
ease
widespread
shortages
across
the
nation
were
piled
up
at
ports
and
rail
depots
,
and
food
shipments
were
rotting
because
of
a
lack
of
people
and
equipment
to
move
the
cargo
.

Strikes
and
mismanagement
were
cited
,
and
Premier
Ryzhkov
warned
of
``
tough
measures
.

''
Bush
indicated
there
might
be
``
room
for
flexibility
''
in
a
bill
to
allow
federal
funding
of
abortions
for
poor
women
who
are
vicitims
of
rape
and
incest
.

He
reiterated
his
opposition
to
such
funding
,
but
expressed
hope
of
a
compromise
.

The
president
,
at
a
news
conference
Friday
,
also
renewed
a
call
for
the
ouster
of
Panama
's
Noriega
.

The
White
House
said
minors
have
n't
any
right
to
abortion
without
the
consent
of
their
parents
.

The
administration
's
policy
was
stated
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
urging
the
Supreme
Court
to
give
states
more
leeway
to
restrict
abortions
.

Ten
of
the
nation
's
governors
,
meanwhile
,
called
on
the
justices
to
reject
efforts
to
limit
abortions
.

The
Justice
Department
announced
that
the
FBI
has
been
given
the
authority
to
seize
U.S.
fugitives
overseas
without
the
permission
of
foreign
governments
.

Secretary
of
State
Baker
emphasized
Friday
that
the
new
policy
would
n't
be
invoked
by
the
Bush
administration
without
full
consideration
of
foreign-policy
implications
.

Hurricane

A
group
of
Arby
's
franchisees
said
they
formed
an
association
to
oppose
Miami
Beach
financier
Victor
Posner
's
control
of
the
restaurant
chain
.

The
decision
is
the
latest
move
in
an
escalating
battle
between
the
franchisees
and
Mr.
Posner
that
began
in
August
.

At
the
time
,
a
group
called
R.B.
Partners
Ltd.
,
consisting
of
eight
of
Arby
's
largest
franchisees
,
offered
more
than
$
200
million
to
buy
Arby
's
Inc.
,
which
is
part
of
DWG
Corp
.

DWG
is
a
holding
company
controlled
by
Mr.
Posner
.

One
week
later
,
Leonard
H.
Roberts
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Arby
's
,
was
fired
in
a
dispute
with
Mr.
Posner
.

Friday
,
42
franchisees
announced
the
formation
of
an
association
--
called
A.P.
Association
Inc.
--
to
``
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
Arby
's
system
.

''
The
franchisees
,
owners
or
operators
of
1,000
of
the
1,900
franchised
Arby
's
in
the
U.S.
,
said
:
``
We
have
concluded
that
continued
control
of
Arby
's
by
Victor
Posner
is
totally
unacceptable
to
us
,
because
it
is
extremely
likely
to
cause
irreparable
damage
to
the
Arby
's
system
.

We
support
all
efforts
to
remove
Victor
Posner
from
control
of
Arby
's
Inc.
and
the
Arby
's
system
.

''
The
group
said
it
would
consider
,
among
other
things
,
withholding
royalty
payments
and
initiating
a
class-action
lawsuit
seeking
court
approval
for
the
withholdings
.

In
Florida
,
Renee
Mottram
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
DWG
,
responded
:
``
We
do
n't
think
any
individual

should
disrupt
a
winning
system
or
illegally
interfere
with
existing
contractual
relationships
for
their
own
self-serving
motives

''
September
's
steep
rise
in
producer
prices
shows
that
inflation
still
persists
,
and
the
pessimism
over
interest
rates
caused
by
the
new
price
data
contributed
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
Friday
.

After
falling
for
three
consecutive
months
,
the
producer
price
index
for
finished
goods
shot
up
0.9
%
last
month
,
the
Labor
Department
reported
Friday
,
as
energy
prices
jumped
after
tumbling
through
the
summer
.

Although
the
report
,
which
was
released
before
the
stock
market
opened
,
did
n't
trigger
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
analysts
said
it
did
play
a
role
in
the
market
's
decline
.

Analysts
immediately
viewed
the
price
data
,
the
grimmest
inflation
news
in
months
,
as
evidence
that
the
Federal
Reserve
was
unlikely
to
allow
interest
rates
to
fall
as
many
investors
had
hoped
.

Further
fueling
the
belief
that
pressures
in
the
economy
were
sufficient
to
keep
the
Fed
from
easing
credit
,
the
Commerce
Department
reported
Friday
that
retail
sales
grew
0.5
%
in
September
,
to
$
145.21
billion
.

That
rise
came
on
top
of
a
0.7
%
gain
in
August
,
and
suggested
there
is
still
healthy
consumer
demand
in
the
economy
.

``
I
think
the
Friday
report
,
combined
with
the
actions
of
the
Fed
,
weakened
the
belief
that
there
was
going
to
be
an
imminent
easing
of
monetary
policy
,
''
said
Robert
Dederick
,
chief
economist
at
Northern
Trust
Co.
in
Chicago
.

But
economists
were
divided
over
the
extent
of
the
inflation
threat
signaled
by
the
new
numbers
.

``
The
overall
0.9
%
increase
is
serious
in
itself
,
but
what
is
even
worse
is
that
excluding
food
and
energy
,
the
producer
price
index
still
increased
by
0.7
%
,
''
said
Gordon
Richards
,
an
economist
at
the
National
Association
of
Manufacturers
.

But
Sung
Won
Sohn
,
chief
economist
at
Norwest
Corp.
in
Minneapolis
,
blamed
rising
energy
prices
and
the
annual
autumn
increase
in
car
prices
for
most
of
the
September
jump
.

``
I
would
say
this
is
not
bad
news
;
this
is
a
blip
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
core
rate
is
not
really
out
of
line
.

''
All
year
,
energy
prices
have
skewed
the
producer
price
index
,
which
measures
changes
in
the
prices
producers
receive
for
goods
.

Inflation
unquestionably
has
fallen
back
from
its
torrid
pace
last
winter
,
when
a
steep
run-up
in
world
oil
prices
sent
the
index
surging
at
double-digit
annual
rates
.

Energy
prices
then
plummeted
through
the
summer
,
causing
the
index
to
decline
for
three
consecutive
months
.

Overall
,
the
index
has
climbed
at
a
5.1
%
compound
annual
rate
since
the
start
of
the
year
,
the
Labor
Department
said
.

While
far
more
restrained
than
the
pace
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
,
that
is
still
a
steeper
rise
than
the
4.0
%
increase
for
all
of
1988
.

Moreover
,
this
year
's
good
inflation
news
may
have
ended
last
month
,
when
energy
prices
zoomed
up
6.5
%
after
plunging
7.3
%
in
August
.

Some
analysts
expect
oil
prices
to
remain
relatively
stable
in
the
months
ahead
,
leaving
the
future
pace
of
inflation
uncertain
.

Analysts
had
expected
that
the
climb
in
oil
prices
last
month
would
lead
to
a
substantial
rise
in
the
producer
price
index
,
but
the
0.9
%
climb
was
higher
than
most
anticipated
.

``
I
think
the
resurgence
{
in
inflation
}
is
going
to
continue
for
a
few
months
,
''
said
John
Mueller
,
chief
economist
at
Bell
Mueller
Cannon
,
a
Washington
economic
forecasting
firm
.

He
predicted
that
inflation
will
moderate
next
year
,
saying
that
credit
conditions
are
fairly
tight
world-wide
.

But
Dirk
Van
Dongen
,
president
of
the
National
Association
of
Wholesaler-Distributors
,
said
that
last
month
's
rise
``
is
n't
as
bad
an
omen
''
as
the
0.9
%
figure
suggests
.

``
If
you
examine
the
data
carefully
,
the
increase
is
concentrated
in
energy
and
motor
vehicle
prices
,
rather
than
being
a
broad-based
advance
in
the
prices
of
consumer
and
industrial
goods
,
''
he
explained
.

Passenger
car
prices
jumped
3.8
%
in
September
,
after
climbing
0.5
%
in
August
and
declining
in
the
late
spring
and
summer
.

Many
analysts
said
the
September
increase
was
a
one-time
event
,
coming
as
dealers
introduced
their
1990
models
.

Although
all
the
price
data
were
adjusted
for
normal
seasonal
fluctuations
,
car
prices
rose
beyond
the
customary
autumn
increase
.

Prices
for
capital
equipment
rose
a
hefty
1.1
%
in
September
,
while
prices
for
home
electronic
equipment
fell
1.1
%
.

Food
prices
declined
0.6
%
,
after
climbing
0.3
%
in
August
.

Meanwhile
,
the
retail
sales
report
showed
that
car
sales
rose
0.8
%
in
September
to
$
32.82
billion
.

But
at
least
part
of
the
increase
could
have
come
from
higher
prices
,
analysts
said
.

Sales
at
general
merchandise
stores
rose
1.7
%
after
declining
0.6
%
in
August
,
while
sales
of
building
materials
fell
1.8
%
after
rising
1.7
%
.

Producer
prices
for
intermediate
goods
grew
0.4
%
in
September
,
after
dropping
for
three
consecutive
months
.

Prices
for
crude
goods
,
an
array
of
raw
materials
,
jumped
1.1
%
after
declining
1.9
%
in
August
and
edging
up
0.2
%
in
July
.

Here
are
the
Labor
Department
's
producer
price
indexes
(
1982
SYM

)
for
September
,
before
seasonal
adjustment
,
and
the
percentage
changes
from
September

CityFed
Financial
Corp.
said
it
expects
to
report
a
loss
of
at
least
$
125
million
to
$
150
million
for
the
third
quarter
.

In
the
year-earlier
period
,
CityFed
had
net
income
of
$
485,000
,
but
no
per-share
earnings
.

CityFed
's
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
John
Atherton
,
said
the
loss
stems
from
several
factors
.

He
said
nonperforming
assets
rose
to
slightly
more
than
$
700
million
from
$
516
million
between
June
and
September
.

Approximately
85
%
of
the
total
consisted
of
nonperforming
commercial
real
estate
assets
.

Accordingly
,
CityFed
estimated
that
it
will
provide
between
$
85
million
and
$
110
million
for
credit
losses
in
the
third
quarter
.

CityFed
added
that
significant
additional
loan-loss
provisions
may
be
required
by
federal
regulators
as
part
of
the
current
annual
examination
of
City
Federal
Savings
Bank
,
CityFed
's
primary
subsidiary
,
based
in
Somerset
,
N.J
.

City
Federal
operates
105
banking
offices
in
New
Jersey
and
Florida
.

Mr.
Atherton
said
CityFed
will
also
mark
its
portfolio
of
high-yield
corporate
bonds
to
market
as
a
result
of
federal
legislation
requiring
that
savings
institutions
divest
themselves
of
such
bonds
.

That
action
,
CityFed
said
,
will
result
in
a
charge
against
third-quarter
results
of
approximately
$
30
million
.

CityFed
also
said
it
expects
to
shed
its
remaining
mortgage
loan
origination
operations
outside
its
principal
markets
in
New
Jersey
and
Florida
and
,
as
a
result
,
is
taking
a
charge
for
discontinued
operations
.

All
these
actions
,
Mr.
Atherton
said
,
will
result
in
a
loss
of
$
125
million
to
$
150
million
for
the
third
quarter
.

He
added
,
however
:
``
Depending
on
the
resolution
of
certain
accounting
issues
relating
to
mortgages
servicing
and
the
outcome
of
the
annual
examination
of
City
Federal
currently
in
progress
with
respect
to
the
appropriate
level
of
loan
loss
reserves
,
the
total
loss
for
the
quarter
could
significantly
exceed
this
range
.

''
CenTrust
Savings
Bank
said
federal
thrift
regulators
ordered
it
to
suspend
dividend
payments
on
its
two
classes
of
preferred
stock
,
indicating
that
regulators
'
concerns
about
the
troubled
institution
have
heightened
.

In
a
statement
,
Miami-based
CenTrust
said
the
regulators
cited
the
thrift
's
operating
losses
and
``
apparent
losses
''
in
its
junk-bond
portfolio
in
ordering
the
suspension
of
the
dividends
.

Regulators
also
ordered
CenTrust
to
stop
buying
back
the
preferred
stock
.

David
L.
Paul
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
criticized
the
federal
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
,
which
issued
the
directive
,
saying
it
was
``
inappropriate
''
and
based
on
``
insufficient
''
reasons
.

He
said
the
thrift
will
try
to
get
regulators
to
reverse
the
decision
.

The
suspension
of
a
preferred
stock
dividend
is
a
serious
step
that
signals
that
regulators
have
deep
concerns
about
an
institution
's
health
.

In
March
,
regulators
labeled
CenTrust
a
``
troubled
institution
,
''
largely
because
of
its
big
junk-bond
holdings
and
its
operating
losses
.

In
the
same
month
,
the
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
ordered
the
institution
to
stop
paying
common
stock
dividends
until
its
operations
were
on
track
.

For
the
nine
months
ended
June
30
,
CenTrust
had
a
net
loss
of
$
21.3
million
,
compared
with
year-earlier
net
income
of
$
52.8
million
.

CenTrust
,
which
is
Florida
's
largest
thrift
,
holds
one
of
the
largest
junk-bond
portfolios
of
any
thrift
in
the
nation
.

Since
April
,
it
has
pared
its
high-yield
bond
holdings
to
about
$
890
million
from
$
1.35
billion
.

Mr.
Paul
said
only
about
$
150
million
of
the
current
holdings
are
tradeable
securities
registered
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

The
remainder
,
he
said
,
are
commercial
loan
participations
,
or
private
placements
,
that
are
n't
filed
with
the
SEC
and
do
n't
have
a
ready
market
.

CenTrust
and
regulators
have
been
in
a
dispute
over
market
valuations
for
the
junk
bonds
.

The
Office
of
Thrift
Supervision
has
been
hounding
CenTrust
to
provide
current
market
values
for
its
holdings
,
but
CenTrust
has
said
it
ca
n't
easily
obtain
such
values
because
of
the
relative
illiquidity
of
the
bonds
and
lack
of
a
ready
market
.

Regulators
have
become
increasingly
antsy
about
CenTrust
's
and
other
thrifts
'
junk-bond
holdings
in
light
of
the
recent
federal
thrift
bailout
legislation
and
the
recent
deep
decline
in
the
junk-bond
market
.

The
legislation
requires
thrifts
to
divest
themselves
of
junk
bonds
in
the
new
,
somber
regulatory
climate
.

In
American
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
Friday
,
CenTrust
common
shares
closed
at
$
3
,
down
12.5
cents
.

In
a
statement
Friday
,
Mr.
Paul
challenged
the
regulators
'
decision
,
saying
the
thrift
's
operating
losses
and
``
apparent
''
junk-bond
losses
``
have
been
substantially
offset
by
gains
in
other
activities
of
the
bank
.

''
He
also
said
substantial
reserves
have
been
set
aside
for
possible
losses
from
the
junk
bonds
.

In
the
third
quarter
,
for
instance
,
CenTrust
added
$
22.5
million
to
its
general
reserves
.

Mr.
Paul
said
the
regulators
should
instead
move
ahead
with
approving
CenTrust
's
request
to
sell
63
of
its
71
branches
to
Great
Western
Bank
,
a
unit
of
Great
Western
Financial
Corp.
based
in
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

The
branch
sale
is
the
centerpiece
of
CenTrust
's
strategy
to
transform
itself
into
a
traditional
S&L
from
a
high-flying
institution
that
relied
heavily
on
securities
trading
for
profits
,
according
to
Mr.
Paul
.

Most
analysts
and
thrift
executives
had
expected
a
decision
on
the
proposed
transaction
,
which
was
announced
in
July
,
long
before
now
.

Many
interpret
the
delay
as
an
indication
that
regulators
are
skeptical
about
the
proposal
.

Branches
and
deposits
can
be
sold
at
a
premium
in
the
event
federal
regulators
take
over
an
institution
.

CenTrust
,
however
,
touts
the
branch
sale
,
saying
it
would
bring
in
$
150
million
and
reduce
the
thrift
's
assets
to
$
6.7
billion
from
$
9
billion
.

It
said
the
sale
would
give
it
positive
tangible
capital
of
$
82
million
,
or
about
1.2
%
of
assets
,
from
a
negative
$
33
million
as
of
Sept.
30
,
thus
bringing
CenTrust
close
to
regulatory
standards
.

CenTrust
said
the
branch
sale
would
also
reduce
the
company
's
large
amount
of
good
will
by
about
$
180
million
.

Critics
,
however
,
say
the
branch
sale
will
make
CenTrust
more
dependent
than
ever
on
brokered
deposits
and
junk
bonds
.

Mr.
Paul
counters
that
he
intends
to
further
pare
the
size
of
CenTrust
by
not
renewing
more
than
$
1
billion
of
brokered
certificates
of
deposit
when
they
come
due
.

The
thrift
is
also
working
to
unload
its
junk-bond
portfolio
by
continuing
to
sell
off
the
bonds
,
and
it
plans
to
eventually
place
some
of
them
in
a
separate
affiliate
,
as
required
under
the
new
thrift
law
.

On
a
recent
Saturday
night
,
in
the
midst
of
West
Germany
's
most
popular
prime-time
show
,
a
contestant
bet
the
host
that
she
could
name
any
of
100
different
cheeses
after
just
one
nibble
,
while
blindfolded
.

The
woman
won
the
bet
.

But
perhaps
even
more
remarkable
,
the
three-hour-show
,
``
Wetten
Dass
''
(
Make
a
Bet
)
,
regularly
wins
the
top
slot
in
the
country
's
TV
ratings
,
sometimes
drawing
as
many
as
50
%
of
West
German
households
.

As
the
1992
economic
integration
approaches
,
Europe
's
cultural
curators
have
taken
to
the
ramparts
against
American
``
cultural
imperialism
,
''
threatening
to
impose
quotas
against
such
pop
invaders
as
``
Dallas
,
''
``
Miami
Vice
''
and
``
L.A.
Law
.

''
But
much
of
what
the
Europeans
want
to
protect
seems
every
bit
as
cheesy
as
what
they
are
trying
to
keep
out
.

The
most
militant
opposition
to
American
TV
imports
has
come
from
French
television
and
movie
producers
,
who
have
demanded
quotas
ensuring
that
a
full
60
%
of
Europe
's
TV
shows
be
produced
in
Europe
.

So
far
,
the
French
have
failed
to
win
enough
broad-based
support
to
prevail
.

A
glance
through
the
television
listings
and
a
few
twists
of
the
European
television
dial
suggest
one
reason
why
.

While
there
are
some
popular
action
and
drama
series
,
few
boast
the
high
culture
and
classy
production
values
one
might
expect
.

More
European
air
time
is
filled
with
low-budget
game
shows
,
variety
hours
,
movies
and
talk
shows
,
many
of
which
are
authorized
knock-offs
of
their
American
counterparts
.

One
of
France
's
most
popular
Saturday
night
programs
features
semi-celebrities
seeking
out
their
grammar-school
classmates
for
on-air
reunions
.

A
Flemish
game
show
has
as
its
host
a
Belgian
pretending
to
be
Italian
.

One
of
Italy
's
favorite
shows
,
``
Fantastico
,
''
a
tepid
variety
show
,
is
so
popular
that
viewers
clamored
to
buy
a
chocolate
product
,
``
Cacao
Fantastico
,
''
whose
praises
were
sung
each
week
by
dancing
showgirls
--
even
though
the
product
did
n't
exist
.

Topping
the
cheese
stunt
,
on
another
typical
evening
of
fun
on
``
Wetten
Dass
,
''
a
contestant
won
a
bet
with
the
show
's
host
,
Thomas
Gottschalk
,
that
he
could
identify
300
German
dialects
over
the
telephone
.

A
celebrity
guest
,
U.S.
Ambassador
to
West
Germany
Richard
Burt
,
also
won
a
bet
that
someone
could
pile
up
$
150
worth
of
quarters
on
a
slanted
coin
.

Mr.
Burt
nonetheless
paid
the
penalty
as
if
he
had
lost
,
agreeing
to
spend
a
day
with
West
German
Foreign
Minister
Hans-Dietrich
Genscher
frying
and
selling
their
combined
weight
in
potato
pancakes
.

If
this
seems
like
pretty
weak
stuff
around
which
to
raise
the
protectionist
barriers
,
it
may
be
because
these
shows
need
all
the
protection
they
can
get
.

European
programs
usually
target
only
their
own
local
audience
,
and
often
only
a
small
portion
of
that
.

Mega-hits
in
Germany
or
Italy
rarely
make
it
even
to
France
or
Great
Britain
,
and
almost
never
show
up
on
U.S.
screens
.

Attempts
to
produce
``
pan-European
''
programs
have
generally
resulted
in
disappointment
.

One
annual
co-production
,
the
three-hour-long
``
Eurovision
Song
Contest
,
''
featuring
soft-rock
songs
from
each
of
20
European
countries
,
has
been
described
as
the
world
's
most
boring
TV
show
.

Another
,
``
Jeux
Sans
Frontieres
,
''
where
villagers
from
assorted
European
countries
make
fools
of
themselves
performing
pointless
tasks
,
is
a
hit
in
France
.

A
U.S.-made
imitation
under
the
title
``
Almost
Anything
Goes
''
flopped
fast
.

For
the
most
part
,
what
's
made
here
stays
here
,
and
for
good
reason
.

The
cream
of
the
British
crop
,
the
literary
dramas
that
are
shown
on
U.S.
public
television
as
``
Masterpiece
Theater
,
''
make
up
a
relatively
small
part
of
British
air
time
.

Most
British
programming
is
more
of
an
acquired
taste
.

There
is
,
for
instance
,
``
One
Man
and
His
Dog
,
''
a
herding
contest
among
sheep
dogs
.

Also
riveting
to
the
British
are
hours
of
dart-throwing
championships
,
even
more
hours
of
lawn
bowling
contests
and
still
more
hours
of
snooker
marathons
.

European
drama
has
had
better
,
though
still
mixed
,
fortunes
.

The
most
popular
such
shows
focus
on
narrow
national
concerns
.

A
French
knock-off
of
``
Dallas
,
''
called
``
Chateauvallon
''
and
set
in
a
French
vineyard
,
had
a
good
run
in
France
,
which
ended
after
the
female
lead
was
injured
in
a
real-life
auto
accident
.

``
Schwarzwaldklinik
,
''
(
Black
Forest
Clinic
)
,
a
kind
of
German
``
St
.

Elsewhere
''
set
in
a
health
spa
,
is
popular
in
Germany
,
and
has
spread
into
France
.

Italy
's
most
popular
series
is
a
drama
called
``
La
Piovra
,
''
or
``
The
Octopus
,
''
which
chronicles
the
fight
of
an
idealistic
young
investigator
in
Palermo
against
the
Mafia
.

It
was
front-page
news
in
Italy
earlier
this
year
when
the
fictional
inspector
was
gunned
down
in
the
series
.

Spain
's
most
popular
mini-series
this
year
was
``
Juncal
,
''
the
story
of
an
aging
bullfighter
.

``
The
trend
is
pretty
well
established
now
that
local
programs
are
the
most
popular
,
with
American
programs
second
,
''
says
Brian
Wenham
,
a
former
director
of
programs
for
the
British
Broadcasting
Corp
.

``
Given
a
choice
,
everybody
will
watch
a
home-produced
show
.

''
But
frequently
there
is
n't
much
choice
.

Thus
,
Europe
has
begun
the
recent
crusade
to
produce
more
worthy
shows
of
its
own
,
programs
with
broader
appeal
.

``
We
've
basically
got
to
start
from
scratch
,
to
train
writers
and
producers
to
make
shows
that
other
people
will
want
to
see
,
''
concedes
Colin
Young
,
head
of
Britain
's
National
Film
Theatre
School
.

While
some
in
the
U.S.
contend
that
advertising
is
the
bane
of
television
,
here
many
believe
that
its
absence
is
to
blame
for
the
European
TV
industry
's
sluggish
development
.

Until
recently
,
national
governments
in
Europe
controlled
most
of
the
air
time
and
allowed
little
or
no
advertising
.

Since
production
costs
were
guaranteed
,
it
did
n't
matter
that
a
program
could
n't
be
sold
abroad
or
put
into
syndication
,
as
most
American
programs
are
.

But
not
much
money
was
spent
on
the
shows
,
either
,
a
situation
that
encouraged
cheap-to-make
talk
and
game
shows
,
while
discouraging
expensive-to-produce
dramas
.

Now
,
however
,
commercial
channels
are
coming
to
most
European
countries
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
satellite
and
cable
technology
is
spreading
rapidly
.

Just
last
week
,
Greece
authorized
two
commercial
channels
for
the
first
time
;
Spain
earlier
began
to
allow
commercial
television
alongside
its
state
channels
.

The
result
is
a
new
and
huge
appetite
for
programming
.

But
perhaps
to
the
consternation
of
those
calling
for
quotas
,
most
of
this
void
is
likely
to
be
filled
with
the
cheapest
and
most
plentiful
programming
now
available
--
reruns
--
usually
of
shows
made
in
the
U.S
.

Sky
Channel
,
a
British-based
venture
of
Australian-American
press
tycoon
Rupert
Murdoch
,
offers
what
must
be
a
baffling
cultural
mix
to
most
of
its
audience
.

The
financially
struggling
station
offers
programs
obviously
made
available
cheaply
from
its
boss
's
other
ventures
.

In
a
Madrid
hotel
room
recently
,
a
viewer
caught
the
end
of
a
badly
acted
series
about
a
fishing
boat
on
Australia
's
Great
Barrier
Reef
,
only
to
be
urged
by
the
British
announcer
to
``
stay
tuned
for
the
further
adventures
of
Skippy
the
Kangaroo
.

Lisa
Grishaw-Mueller
in
Bonn
,
Laura
Colby
in
Milan
,
Tim
Carrington
in
London
and
Carlta
Vitzhum
in
Madrid
contributed
to
this
article
.

British
Aerospace
PLC
and
France
's
Thomson-CSF
S.A.
said
they
are
nearing
an
agreement
to
merge
their
guided-missile
divisions
,
greatly
expanding
collaboration
between
the
two
defense
contractors
.

The
50-50
joint
venture
,
which
may
be
dubbed
Eurodynamics
,
would
have
combined
annual
sales
of
at
least
#
1.4
billion
(
$
2.17
billion
)
and
would
be
among
the
world
's
largest
missile
makers
.

After
two
years
of
talks
,
plans
for
the
venture
are
sufficiently
advanced
for
the
companies
to
seek
French
and
British
government
clearance
.

The
companies
hope
for
a
final
agreement
by
year-end
.

The
venture
would
strengthen
the
rapidly
growing
ties
between
the
two
companies
,
and
help
make
them
a
leading
force
in
European
defense
contracting
.

In
recent
months
,
a
string
of
cross-border
mergers
and
joint
ventures
have
reshaped
the
once-balkanized
world
of
European
arms
manufacture
.

Already
,
British
Aerospace
and
French
government-controlled
Thomson-CSF
collaborate
on
a
British
missile
contract
and
on
an
air-traffic
control
radar
system
.

Just
last
week
they
announced
they
may
make
a
joint
bid
to
buy
Ferranti
International
Signal
PLC
,
a
smaller
British
defense
contractor
rocked
by
alleged
accounting
fraud
at
a
U.S.
unit
.

The
sudden
romance
of
British
Aerospace
and
Thomson-CSF
--
traditionally
bitter
competitors
for
Middle
East
and
Third
World
weapons
contracts
--
is
stirring
controversy
in
Western
Europe
's
defense
industry
.

Most
threatened
by
closer
British
Aerospace-Thomson
ties
would
be
their
respective
national
rivals
,
including
Matra
S.A.
in
France
and
Britain
's
General
Electric
Co.
PLC
.

But
neither
Matra
nor
GEC
--
unrelated
to
Stamford
,
Conn.-based
General
Electric
Co.
--
are
sitting
quietly
by
as
their
competitors
join
forces
.

Yesterday
,
a
source
close
to
GEC
confirmed
that
his
company
may
join
the
Ferranti
fight
,
as
part
of
a
possible
consortium
that
would
bid
against
British
Aerospace
and
Thomson-CSF
.

Companies
with
which
GEC
has
had
talks
about
a
possible
joint
Ferranti
bid
include
Matra
,
Britain
's
Dowty
Group
PLC
,
West
Germany
's
Daimler-Benz
AG
,
and
France
's
Dassault
group
.

But
it
may
be
weeks
before
GEC
and
its
potential
partners
decide
whether
to
bid
,
the
source
indicated
.

GEC
plans
first
to
study
Ferranti
's
financial
accounts
,
which
auditors
recently
said
included
#
215
million
in
fictitious
contracts
at
a
U.S.
unit
,
International
Signal
&
Control
Group
,
with
which
Ferranti
merged
last
year
.

Also
,
any
GEC
bid
might
be
blocked
by
British
antitrust
regulators
;
Ferranti
is
GEC
's
main
competitor
on
several
key
defense-electronics
contracts
,
and
its
purchase
by
GEC
may
heighten
British
Defense
Ministry
worries
about
concentration
in
the
country
's
defense
industry
.

A
consortium
bid
,
however
,
would
diminish
GEC
's
direct
role
in
Ferranti
and
might
consequently
appease
ministry
officials
.

A
British
Aerospace
spokeswoman
appeared
unperturbed
by
the
prospect
of
a
fight
with
GEC
for
Ferranti
:
``
Competition
is
the
name
of
the
game
,
''
she
said
.

At
least
one
potential
GEC
partner
,
Matra
,
insists
it
is
n't
interested
in
Ferranti
.

``
We
have
nothing
to
say
about
this
affair
,
which
does
n't
concern
us
,
''
a
Matra
official
said
Sunday
.

The
missile
venture
,
the
British
Aerospace
spokeswoman
said
,
is
a
needed
response
to
the
``
new
environment
''
in
defense
contracting
.

For
both
Thomson
and
British
Aerospace
,
earnings
in
their
home
markets
have
come
under
pressure
from
increasingly
tight-fisted
defense
ministries
;
and
Middle
East
sales
,
a
traditional
mainstay
for
both
companies
'
exports
,
have
been
hurt
by
five
years
of
weak
oil
prices
.

The
venture
's
importance
for
Thomson
is
great
.

Thomson
feels
the
future
of
its
defense
business
depends
on
building
cooperation
with
other
Europeans
.

The
European
defense
industry
is
consolidating
;
for
instance
,
West
Germany
's
Siemens
AG
recently
joined
GEC
in
a
takeover
of
Britain
's
Plessey
Co.
,
and
Daimler-Benz
agreed
to
buy
Messerschmitt-Boelkow
Blohm
G.m.b
.

H
.

In
missiles
,
Thomson
is
already
overshadowed
by
British
Aerospace
and
by
its
home
rival
,
France
's
Aerospatiale
S.A.
;
to
better
compete
,
Thomson
officials
say
,
they
need
a
partnership
.

To
justify
50-50
ownership
of
the
planned
venture
,
Thomson
would
make
a
cash
payment
to
British
Aerospace
.

Annual
revenue
of
British
Aerospace
's
missile
business
is
about
#
950
million
,
a
Thomson
spokesman
said
.

British
Aerospace
's
chief
missile
products
include
its
17-year-old
family
of
Rapier
surface-to-air
missiles
.

Thomson
missile
products
,
with
about
half
British
Aerospace
's
annual
revenue
,
include
the
Crotale
surface-to-air
missile
family
.

Interprovincial
Pipe
Line
Co.
said
it
will
delay
a
proposed
two-step
,
830
million
Canadian-dollar
(
US$
705.6
million
)
expansion
of
its
system
because
Canada
's
output
of
crude
oil
is
shrinking
.

Interprovincial
,
Canada
's
biggest
oil
pipeline
operator
and
a
major
transporter
of
crude
to
the
U.S.
,
said
revised
industry
forecasts
indicate
that
Canadian
oil
output
will
total
about
1.64
million
barrels
a
day
by
1991
,
8
%
lower
than
a
previous
estimate
.

Canadian
crude
production
averaged
about
1.69
million
barrels
a
day
during
1989
's
first
half
,
about
1
%
below
the
1988
level
.

``
The
capability
of
existing
fields
to
deliver
oil
is
dropping
,
''
and
oil
exploration
activity
is
also
down
dramatically
,
as
many
producers
shift
their
emphasis
to
natural
gas
,
said
Ronald
Watkins
,
vice
president
for
government
and
industry
relations
with
Interprovincial
's
parent
,
Interhome
Energy
Inc
.

Mr.
Watkins
said
volume
on
Interprovincial
's
system
is
down
about
2
%
since
January
and
is
expected
to
fall
further
,
making
expansion
unnecessary
until
perhaps
the
mid-1990s
.

``
There
has
been
a
swing
of
the
pendulum
back
to
the
gas
side
,
''
he
said
.

Many
of
Canada
's
oil
and
gas
producers
say
the
outlook
for
natural
gas
is
better
than
it
is
for
oil
,
and
have
shifted
their
exploration
and
development
budgets
accordingly
.

The
number
of
active
drilling
rigs
in
Canada
is
down
30
%
from
a
year
ago
,
and
the
number
of
completed
oil
wells
is
``
down
more
than
that
,
due
to
the
increasing
focus
on
gas
exploration
,
''
said
Robert
Feick
,
manager
of
crude
oil
with
Calgary
's
Independent
Petroleum
Association
of
Canada
,
an
industry
group
.

Mr.
Watkins
said
the
main
reason
for
the
production
decline
is
shrinking
output
of
light
crude
from
mature
,
conventional
fields
in
western
Canada
.

Interprovincial
transports
about
75
%
of
all
crude
produced
in
western
Canada
,
and
almost
60
%
of
Interprovincial
's
total
volume
consists
of
light
crude
.

Nearly
all
of
the
crude
oil
that
Canada
exports
to
the
U.S.
is
transported
on
Interprovincial
's
system
,
whose
main
line
runs
from
Edmonton
to
major
U.S.
and
Canadian
cities
in
the
Great
Lakes
region
,
including
Chicago
,
Buffalo
,
Toronto
and
Montreal
.

Canada
's
current
oil
exports
to
the
U.S.
total
about
600,000
barrels
a
day
,
or
about
9.1
%
of
net
U.S.
crude
imports
,
said
John
Lichtblau
,
president
of
the
New
York-based
Petroleum
Industry
Research
Foundation
.

That
ranks
Canada
as
the
fourth-largest
source
of
imported
crude
,
behind
Saudi
Arabia
,
Nigeria
and
Mexico
.

Mr.
Lichtblau
said
Canada
's
declining
crude
output
,
combined
with
the
fast-shrinking
output
of
U.S.
crude
,
will
help
intensify
U.S.
reliance
on
oil
from
overseas
,
particularly
the
Middle
East
.

``
It
's
very
much
a
growing
concern
.

But
when
something
is
inevitable
,
you
learn
to
live
with
it
,
''
he
said
.

Mr.
Lichtblau
stressed
that
the
delay
of
Interprovincial
's
proposed
expansion
wo
n't
by
itself
increase
U.S.
dependence
on
offshore
crude
,
however
,
since
Canadian
imports
are
limited
in
any
case
by
Canada
's
falling
output
.

Under
terms
of
its
proposed
two-step
expansion
,
which
would
have
required
regulatory
approval
,
Interprovincial
intended
to
add
200,000
barrels
a
day
of
additional
capacity
to
its
system
,
beginning
with
a
modest
expansion
by
1991
.

The
system
currently
has
a
capacity
of
1.55
million
barrels
a
day
.

Inland
Steel
Industries
Inc.
expects
to
report
that
third-quarter
earnings
dropped
more
than
50
%
from
the
previous
quarter
as
a
result
of
reduced
sales
volume
and
increased
costs
.

In
the
second
quarter
,
the
steelmaker
had
net
income
of
$
45.3
million
or
$
1.25
a
share
,
including
a
pretax
charge
of
$
17
million
related
to
the
settlement
of
a
suit
,
on
sales
of
$
1.11
billion
.

The
company
said
normal
seasonal
softness
and
lost
orders
caused
by
prolonged
labor
talks
reduced
shipments
by
200,000
tons
in
the
latest
quarter
,
compared
with
the
second
quarter
.

At
the
same
time
,
the
integrated-steel
business
was
hurt
by
continued
increases
in
materials
costs
and
repair
and
maintenance
expenses
,
as
well
as
higher
labor
costs
under
its
new
contract
.

The
service-center
business
was
hurt
by
reduced
margins
and
start-up
costs
associated
with
its
Joseph
T.
Ryerson
&
Son
unit
.

The
company
said
it
is
beginning
to
see
some
shipping-rate
improvements
in
both
the
intergrated-steel
and
steel-service-center
segments
,
which
should
result
in
improved
results
for
the
fourth
quarter
.

Inland
said
its
third-quarter
results
will
be
announced
later
this
week
.

In
the
year-earlier
third
quarter
,
when
the
industry
was
in
the
midst
of
a
boom
,
the
company
had
net
of
$
61
million
,
or
$
1.70
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
1.02
billion
.

Predicting
the
financial
results
of
computer
firms
has
been
a
tough
job
lately
.

Take
Microsoft
Corp.
,
the
largest
maker
of
personal
computer
software
and
generally
considered
an
industry
bellwether
.

In
July
,
the
company
stunned
Wall
Street
with
the
prediction
that
growth
in
the
personal
computer
business
overall
would
be
only
10
%
in
1990
,
a
modest
increase
when
compared
with
the
sizzling
expansion
of
years
past
.

Investors
--
taking
this
as
a
sign
that
a
broad
industry
slump
was
in
the
offing
--
reacted
by
selling
the
company
's
stock
,
which
lost
$
3.25
that
day
to
close
at
$
52
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

But
that
was
all
of
three
months
ago
.

Last
week
,
Microsoft
said
it
expects
revenue
for
its
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
to
increase
34
%
.

The
announcement
caused
the
company
's
stock
to
surge
$
6.50
to
close
at
$
75.50
a
share
.

Microsoft
's
surprising
strength
is
one
example
of
the
difficulty
facing
investors
looking
for
reassurances
about
the
financial
health
of
the
computer
firms
.

``
It
's
hard
to
know
what
to
expect
at
this
point
,
''
said
Peter
Rogers
,
an
analyst
at
Robertson
Stephens
&
Co
.

``
The
industry
defies
characterization
.

''
To
illustrate
,
Mr.
Rogers
said
that
of
the
14
computer-related
firms
he
follows
,
half
will
report
for
their
most
recent
quarter
earnings
below
last
year
's
results
,
and
half
above
those
results
.

Among
those
companies
expected
to
have
a
down
quarter
are
Hewlett-Packard
Co.
,
Amdahl
Corp.
and
Sun
Microsystems
Inc.
,
generally
solid
performers
in
the
past
.

International
Business
Machines
Corp.
also
is
expected
to
report
disappointing
results
.

Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
meanwhile
,
is
expected
to
show
improved
earnings
for
the
period
ended
Sept
.

Another
contradictory
message
comes
from
Businessland
Inc.
,
a
computer
retailer
.

In
July
,
the
company
reported
that
booming
sales
of
new
personal
computers
from
Apple
and
IBM
had
resulted
in
net
income
more
than
doubling
for
its
fourth
quarter
ended
June
30
to
$
7.4
million
,
or
23
cents
a
share
.

This
month
,
however
,
Businessland
warned
investors
that
results
for
its
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
had
n't
met
expectations
.

The
company
said
it
expects
earnings
of
14
to
17
cents
a
share
,
down
from
25
cents
a
share
in
the
year-earlier
period
.

While
the
earnings
picture
confuses
,
observers
say
the
major
forces
expected
to
shape
the
industry
in
the
coming
year
are
clearer
.

Companies
will
continue
to
war
over
standards
.

In
computer
publishing
,
a
battle
over
typefaces
is
hurting
Adobe
Systems
Inc.
,
which
sells
software
that
controls
the
image
produced
by
printers
and
displays
.

Until
recently
,
Adobe
had
a
lock
on
the
market
for
image
software
,
but
last
month
Apple
,
Adobe
's
biggest
customer
,
and
Microsoft
rebelled
.

Now
the
two
firms
are
collaborating
on
an
alternative
to
Adobe
's
approach
,
and
analysts
say
they
are
likely
to
carry
IBM
,
the
biggest
seller
of
personal
computers
,
along
with
them
.

The
short-term
outlook
for
Adobe
's
business
,
however
,
appears
strong
.

The
company
is
beginning
to
ship
a
new
software
program
that
's
being
heralded
as
a
boon
for
owners
of
low-end
printers
sold
by
Apple
.

The
program
is
aimed
at
improving
the
quality
of
printed
material
.

John
Warnock
,
Adobe
's
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
Mountain
View
,
Calif.
,
company
has
been
receiving
1,000
calls
a
day
about
the
product
since
it
was
demonstrated
at
a
computer
publishing
conference
several
weeks
ago
.

Meanwhile
,
competition
between
various
operating
systems
,
which
control
the
basic
functions
of
a
computer
,
spells
trouble
for
software
firms
generally
.

``
It
creates
uncertainty
and
usually
slows
down
sales
,
''
said
Russ
Crabs
,
an
analyst
at
Soundview
Financial
Group
.

Mr.
Crabs
said
this
probably
is
behind
the
expected
weak
performance
of
Aldus
Corp.
,
maker
of
a
widely
used
computer
publishing
program
.

He
expects
Aldus
to
report
earnings
of
21
cents
a
share
on
revenues
of
$
19.5
million
for
its
third
quarter
,
compared
with
earnings
of
30
cents
a
share
on
revenue
of
20.4
million
in
the
year-earlier
period
.

Aldus
officials
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

On
the
other
hand
,
the
battle
of
the
bus
is
expected
to
grow
increasingly
irrelevant
.

A
bus
is
the
data
highway
within
a
computer
.

IBM
is
backing
one
type
of
bus
called
microchannel
,
while
the
nine
other
leading
computer
makers
,
including
H-P
and
Compaq
Computer
Corp.
,
have
chosen
another
method
.

``
Users
do
n't
care
about
the
bus
,
''
said
Daniel
Benton
,
an
analyst
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

He
said
Apple
's
family
of
Macintosh
computers
,
for
instance
,
uses
four
different
buses
``
and
no
one
seems
to
mind
.

''
The
gap
between
winners
and
laggards
will
grow
.

In
personal
computers
,
Apple
,
Compaq
and
IBM
are
expected
to
tighten
their
hold
on
their
business
.

At
the
same
time
,
second-tier
firms
will
continue
to
lose
ground
.

Some
lagging
competitors
even
may
leave
the
personal
computer
business
altogether
.

Wyse
Technology
,
for
instance
,
is
considered
a
candidate
to
sell
its
troubled
operation
.

``
Wyse
has
done
well
establishing
a
distribution
business
,
but
they
have
n't
delivered
products
that
sell
,
''
said
Kimball
Brown
,
an
analyst
at
Prudential-Bache
Securities
.

Mr.
Brown
estimates
Wyse
,
whose
terminals
business
is
strong
,
will
report
a
loss
of
12
cents
a
share
for
its
quarter
ended
Sept
.

Personal-computer
makers
will
continue
to
eat
away
at
the
business
of
more
traditional
computer
firms
.

Ever-more
powerful
desk-top
computers
,
designed
with
one
or
more
microprocessors
as
their
``
brains
,
''
are
expected
to
increasingly
take
on
functions
carried
out
by
more
expensive
minicomputers
and
mainframes
.

``
The
guys
that
make
traditional
hardware
are
really
being
obsoleted
by
microprocessor-based
machines
,
''
said
Mr.
Benton
.

As
a
result
of
this
trend
,
longtime
powerhouses
H-P
,
IBM
and
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
are
scrambling
to
counterattack
with
microprocessor-based
systems
of
their
own
.

But
they
will
have
to
act
quickly
.

Mr.
Benton
expects
Compaq
to
unveil
a
family
of
high-end
personal
computers
later
this
year
that
are
powerful
enough
to
serve
as
the
hub
for
communications
within
large

A

companies
also
has
targeted
this

market

Population
Drain
Ends
For
Midwestern
States
IOWA
IS
MAKING
a
comeback
.

So
are
Indiana
,
Ohio
and
Michigan
.

The
population
of
all
four
states
is
on
the
upswing
,
according
to
new
Census
Bureau
estimates
,
following
declines
throughout
the
early
1980s
.

The
gains
,
to
be
sure
,
are
rather
small
.

Iowa
,
for
instance
,
saw
its
population
grow
by
11,000
people
,
or
0.4
%
,
between
1987
and
1988
,
the
Census
Bureau
says
.

Still
,
even
that
modest
increase
is
good
news
for
a
state
that
had
n't
grown
at
all
since
1981
.

Between
1987
and
1988
,
North
Dakota
was
the
only
state
in
the
Midwest
to
lose
population
,
a
loss
of
4,000
people
.

Six
of
the
12
midwestern
states
have
been
growing
steadily
since
1980
--
Illinois
,
Kansas
,
Minnesota
,
Missouri
,
South
Dakota
and
Wisconsin
.

The
Northeast
has
been
holding
its
own
in
the
population
race
.

Seven
of
nine
states
have
grown
each
year
since
1980
,
including
New
York
,
which
lost
4
%
of
its
population
during
the
1970s
.

And
although
Pennsylvania
and
Massachusetts
suffered
slight
declines
earlier
in
the
decade
,
they
are
growing
again
.

At
the
same
time
,
several
states
in
the
South
and
West
have
had
their
own
population
turnaround
.

Seven
states
that
grew
in
the
early
1980s
are
now
losing
population
--
West
Virginia
,
Mississippi
,
Louisiana
,
Oklahoma
,
Montana
,
Wyoming
and
Alaska
.

Overall
,
though
,
the
South
and
West
still
outpace
the
Northeast
and
Midwest
,
and
fast-growing
states
like
Florida
and
California
ensure
that
the
pattern
will
continue
.

But
the
growth
gap
between
the
Sun
Belt
and
other
regions
has
clearly
started
narrowing
.

More
Elderly
Maintain
Their
Independence
THANKS
TO
modern
medicine
,
more
couples
are
growing
old
together
.

And
even
after
losing
a
spouse
,
more
of
the
elderly
are
staying
independent
.

A
new
Census
Bureau
study
of
the
noninstitutionalized
population
shows
that
64
%
of
people
aged
65
to
74
were
living
with
a
spouse
in
1988
,
up
from
59
%
in
1970
.

This
does
n't
mean
they
're
less
likely
to
live
alone
,
however
.

That
share
has
remained
at
about
24
%
since
1970
.

What
has
changed
is
that
more
of
the
young
elderly
are
living
with
spouses
rather
than
with
other
relatives
,
such
as
children
.

In
1988
,
10
%
of
those
aged
65
to
74
lived
with
relatives
other
than
spouses
,
down
from
15
%
in
1970
.

As
people
get
even
older
,
many
become
widowed
.

But
even
among
those
aged
75
and
older
,
the
share
living
with
a
spouse
rose
slightly
,
to
40
%
in
1988
from
38
%
in
1970
.

Like
their
younger
counterparts
,
the
older
elderly
are
less
likely
to
live
with
other
relatives
.

Only
17
%
of
those
aged
75
and
older
lived
with
relatives
other
than
spouses
in
1988
,
down
from
26
%
in
1970
.

The
likelihood
of
living
alone
beyond
the
age
of
75
has
increased
to
40
%
from
32
%
.

More
people
are
remaining
independent
longer
presumably
because
they
are
better
off
physically
and
financially
.

Careers
Count
Most
For
the
Well-to-Do
MANY
AFFLUENT
people
place
personal
success
and
money
above
family
.

At
least
that
's
what
a
survey
by
Ernst
&
Young
and
Yankelovich
,
Clancy
,
Shulman
indicates
.

Two-thirds
of
respondents
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
be
successful
in
their
jobs
,
while
fewer
than
half
said
they
strongly
felt
the
need
to
spend
more
time
with
their
families
.

Being
successful
in
careers
and
spending
the
money
they
make
are
top
priorities
for
this
group
.

Unlike
most
studies
of
the
affluent
market
,
this
survey
excluded
the
super-rich
.

Average
household
income
for
the
sample
was
$
194,000
,
and
average
net
assets
were
reported
as
$
775,000
.

The
goal
was
to
learn
about
one
of
today
's
fastest-growing
income
groups
,
the
upper-middle
class
.

Although
they
represent
only
2
%
of
the
population
,
they
control
nearly
one-third
of
discretionary
income
.

Across
the
board
,
these
consumers
value
quality
,
buy
what
they
like
rather
than
just
what
they
need
,
and
appreciate
products
that
are
distinctive
.

Despite
their
considerable
incomes
and
assets
,
40
%
of
the
respondents
in
the
study
do
n't
feel
financially
secure
,
and
one-fourth
do
n't
feel
that
they
have
made
it
.

Twenty
percent
do
n't
even
feel
they
are
financially
well
off
.

Many
of
the
affluent
are
n't
comfortable
with
themselves
,
either
.

About
40
%
do
n't
feel
they
're
more
able
than
others
.

While
twothirds
feel
some
guilt
about
being
affluent
,
only
25
%
give
$
2,500
or
more
to
charity
each
year
.

Thirty-five
percent
attend
religious
services
regularly
;
at
the
same
time
,
60
%
feel
that
in
life
one
sometimes
has
to
compromise
one
's
principles
.

Odds
and
Ends
THE
NUMBER
of
women
and
minorities
who
hold
jobs
in
top
management
in
the
nation
's
largest
banks
has
more
than
doubled
since
1978
.

The
American
Bankers
Association
says
that
women
make
up
47
%
of
officials
and
managers
in
the
top
50
banks
,
up
from
33
%
in
1978
.

The
share
of
minorities
in
those
positions
has
risen
to
16
%
from
12
%
...
.

Per-capita
personal
income
in
the
U.S.
grew
faster
than
inflation
last
year
,
according
to
the
Bureau
of
Economic
Analysis
.

The
amount
of
income
divvied
up
for
each
man
,
woman
and
child
was
$
16,489
in
1988
,
up
6.6
%
from
$
15,472
in
1987
.

Per
capita
personal
income
ranged
from
$
11,116
in
Mississippi
to
$
23,059
in
Connecticut
...
.

There
are
13.1
million
students
in
college
this
fall
,
up
2
%
from
1988
,
the
National
Center
for
Education
Statistics
estimates
.

About
54
%
are
women
,
and
44
%
are
part-time
students
.

This
small
Dallas
suburb
's
got
trouble
.

Trouble
with
a
capital
T
and
that
rhymes
with
P
and
that
stands
for
pool
.

More
than
30
years
ago
,
Prof.
Harold
Hill
,
the
con
man
in
Meredith
Willson
's
``
The
Music
Man
,
''
warned
the
citizens
of
River
City
,
Iowa
,
against
the
game
.

Now
kindred
spirits
on
Addison
's
town
council
have
barred
the
town
's
fanciest
hotel
,
the
Grand
Kempinski
,
from
installing
three
free
pool
tables
in
its
new
lounge
.

Mayor
Lynn
Spruill
and
two
members
of
the
council
said
they
were
worried
about
setting
a
precedent
that
would
permit
pool
halls
along
Addison
's
main
street
.

And
the
mayor
,
in
an
admonition
that
bears
a
rhythmic
resemblance
to
Prof.
Hill
's
,
warned
that
``
alcohol
leads
to
betting
,
which
leads
to
fights
.

''
The
council
's
action
is
yet
another
blow
to
a
sport
that
its
fans
claim
has
been
maligned
unjustly
for
years
.

``
Obviously
they
're
not
in
touch
with
what
's
going
on
,
''
says
Tom
Manske
,
vice
president
of
the
National
Pocket
Billiards
Association
.

Pool
is
hot
in
New
York
and
Chicago
,
he
insists
,
where
``
upscale
,
suit-and-tie
places
''
are
adding
tables
.

With
today
's
tougher
drunk
driving
laws
,
he
adds
,
``
people
do
n't
want
to
just
sit
around
and
drink
.

''
Besides
,
rowdy
behavior
seems
unlikely
at
the
Grand
Kempinski
,
where
rooms
average
$
200
a
night
and
the
cheap
mixed
drinks
go
for
$
3.50
a
pop
.

At
the
lounge
,
manager
Elizabeth
Dyer
wo
n't
admit
patrons
in
jeans
,
T-shirts
or
tennis
shoes
.

But
a
majority
of
the
Addison
council
did
n't
buy
those
arguments
.

Introducing
pool
,
argued
Councilwoman
Riley
Reinker
,
would
be
``
dangerous
.

It
would
open
a
can
of
worms
.

''
Addison
is
no
stranger
to
cans
of
worms
,
either
.

After
its
previous
mayor
committed
suicide
last
year
,
an
investigation
disclosed
that
town
officials
regularly
voted
on
their
own
projects
,
gave
special
favors
to
developer
friends
and
dipped
into
the
town
's
coffers
for
trips
and
retreats
.

The
revelations
embarrassed
town
officials
,
although
they
argued
that
the
problems
were
n't
as
severe
as
the
media
suggested
.

Now
comes
the
pool
flap
.

``
I
think
there
's
some
people
worried
about
something
pretty
ridiculous
,
''
Councilman
John
Nolan
says
.

``
I
thought
this
was
all
taken
care
of
in
`
The
Music
Man
.

'
''
The
only
thing
Robert
Goldberg
could
praise
about
CBS
's
new
show
``
Island
Son
''
(
Leisure
&
Arts
,
Sept.
25
)
was
the
local
color
;
unfortunately
neither
he
nor
the
producers
of
the
show
have
done
their
homework
.

For
instance
:
``
Haole
''
(
white
)
is
not
the
ultimate
insult
;
``
Mainland
haole
''
is
.

Richard
Chamberlain
dresses
as
a
``
Mainland
haole
,
''
tucking
in
a
Hawaiian
shirt
and
rolling
up
its
long
sleeves
.

And
the
local
expression
for
brother
is
``
brah
,
''
not
``
bruddah
.

''
And
even
if
a
nurse
would
wear
flowers
in
her
hair
while
on
duty
,
if
she
were
engaged
she
would
know
to
wear
them
behind
her
left
,
not
right
,
ear
.

Sorry
,
the
show
does
not
even
have
the
one
redeeming
quality
of
genuine
local
color
.

Anita
Davis
Austin
,
Texas
Of
all
the
ethnic
tensions
in
America
,
which
is
the
most
troublesome
right
now
?
A
good
bet
would
be
the
tension
between
blacks
and
Jews
in
New
York
City
.

Or
so
it
must
seem
to
Jackie
Mason
,
the
veteran
Jewish
comedian
appearing
in
a
new
ABC
sitcom
airing
on
Tuesday
nights
(
9:30-10
p.m.
EDT
)
.

Not
only
is
Mr.
Mason
the
star
of
``
Chicken
Soup
,
''
he
's
also
the
inheritor
of
a
comedic
tradition
dating
back
to
``
Duck
Soup
,
''
and
he
's
currently
a
man
in
hot
water
.

Here
,
in
neutral
language
,
is
the
gist
of
Mr.
Mason
's
remarks
,
quoted
first
in
the
Village
Voice
while
he
was
a
paid
spokesman
for
the
Rudolph
Giuliani
mayoral
campaign
,
and
then
in
Newsweek
after
he
and
the
campaign
parted
company
.

Mr.
Mason
said
that
many
Jewish
voters
feel
guilty
toward
blacks
,
so
they
support
black
candidates
uncritically
.

He
said
that
many
black
voters
feel
bitter
about
racial
discrimination
,
so
they
,
too
,
support
black
candidates
uncritically
.

He
said
that
Jews
have
contributed
more
to
black
causes
over
the
years
than
vice
versa
.

Of
course
,
Mr.
Mason
did
not
use
neutral
language
.

As
a
practitioner
of
ethnic
humor
from
the
old
days
on
the
Borscht
Belt
,
live
television
and
the
nightclub
circuit
,
Mr.
Mason
instinctively
reached
for
the
vernacular
.

He
said
Jews
were
``
sick
with
complexes
''
;
and
he
called
David
Dinkins
,
Mr.
Giuliani
's
black
opponent
,
``
a
fancy
shvartze
with
a
mustache
.

''
If
Mr.
Mason
had
used
less
derogatory
language
to
articulate
his
amateur
analysis
of
the
voting
behavior
of
his
fellow
New
Yorkers
,
would
the
water
be
quite
so
hot
?
It
probably
would
,
because
few
or
none
of
the
people
upset
by
Mr.
Mason
's
remarks
have
bothered
to
distinguish
between
the
substance
of
his
comments
and
the
fact
that
he
used
insulting
language
.

In
addition
,
some
of
Mr.
Mason
's
critics
have
implied
that
his
type
of
ethnic
humor
is
itself
a
form
of
racism
.

For
example
,
the
New
York
state
counsel
for
the
NAACP
said
that
Mr.
Mason
is
``
like
a
dinosaur
.

People
are
fast
leaving
the
place
where
he
is
stuck
.

''
These
critics
fail
to
distinguish
between
the
type
of
ethnic
humor
that
aims
at
disparaging
another
group
,
such
as
``
Polish
jokes
''
;
and
the
type
that
is
double-edged
,
aiming
inward
as
well
as
outward
.

The
latter
typically
is
the
humor
of
the
underdog
,
and
it
was
perfected
by
both
blacks
and
Jews
on
the
minstrel
and
vaudeville
stage
as
a
means
of
mocking
their
white
and
gentile
audiences
along
with
themselves
.

In
the
hands
of
a
zealot
like
Lenny
Bruce
,
this
double-edged
blade
could
cut
both
the
self
and
the
audience
to
ribbons
.

But
wielded
by
a
pro
like
Jackie
Mason
,
it
is
a
constructive
form
of
mischief
.

Why
constructive
?
Because
despite
all
the
media
prattle
about
comedy
and
politics
not
mixing
,
they
are
similar
in
one
respect
:
Both
can
serve
as
mechanisms
for
easing
tensions
and
facilitating
the
co-existence
of
groups
in
conflict
.

That
's
why
it
's
dangerous
to
have
well-intentioned
thought
police
,
on
college
campuses
and
elsewhere
,
taboo
all
critical
mention
of
group
differences
.

As
Elizabeth
Kristol
wrote
in
the
New
York
Times
just
before
the
Mason
donnybrook
,
``
Perhaps
intolerance
would
not
boil
over
with
such
intensity
if
honest
differences
were
allowed
to
simmer
.

''
The
question
is
,
if
group
conflicts
still
exist
(
as
undeniably
they
do
)
,
and
if
Mr.
Mason
's
type
of
ethnic
humor
is
passe
,
then
what
other
means
do
we
have
for
letting
off
steam
?
Do
n't
say
the
TV
sitcom
,
because
that
happens
to
be
a
genre
that
,
in
its
desperate
need
to
attract
everybody
and
offend
nobody
,
resembles
politics
more
than
it
does
comedy
.

It
is
true
that
the
best
sitcoms
do
allow
group
differences
to
simmer
:
yuppies
vs.
blue-collar
Bostonians
in
``
Cheers
''
;
children
vs.
adults
in
``
The
Cosby
Show
.

''
But
these
are
not
the
differences
that
make
headlines
.

In
``
Chicken
Soup
,
''
Mr.
Mason
plays
Jackie
,
a
Jewish
bachelor
courting
Maddie
(
Lynn
Redgrave
)
,
an
Irish
widow
and
mother
of
three
,
against
the
wishes
of
his
mother
(
Rita
Karin
)
and
her
brother
Michael
(
Brandon
Maggart
)
.

It
's
worth
noting
that
both
disapproving
relatives
are
immigrants
.

At
least
,
they
both
speak
with
strong
accents
,
as
do
Jackie
and
Maddie
.

It
could
n't
be
more
obvious
that
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
being
made
from
an
old
recipe
.

And
a
safe
one
--
imagine
if
the
romance
in
question
were
between
an
Orthodox
Jew
and
a
member
of
the
Nation
of
Islam
.

Back
in
the
1920s
,
the
play
and
movie
versions
of
``
Abie
's
Irish
Rose
''
made
the
theme
of
courtship
between
the
assimilated
offspring
of
Jewish
and
Irish
immigrants
so
popular
that
its
author
,
Anne
Nichols
,
lost
a
plagiarism
suit
on
the
grounds
that
the
plot
has
entered
the
public
domain
.

And
it
has
remained
there
,
as
evidenced
by
its
reappearance
in
a
1972
CBS
sitcom
called
``
Bridget
Loves
Bernie
,
''
whose
sole
distinction
was
that
it
led
to
the
real-life
marriage
of
Meredith
Baxter
and
David
Birney
.

Clearly
,
the
question
with
``
Chicken
Soup
''
is
not
whether
the
pot
will
boil
over
,
but
whether
it
will
simmer
at
all
.

So
far
,
the
bubbles
have
been
few
and
far
between
.

Part
of
the
problem
is
the
tendency
of
all
sitcoms
,
ever
since
the
didactic
days
of
Norman
Lear
,
to
preach
about
social
issues
.

To
some
extent
,
this
tendency
emerges
whenever
the
show
tries
to
enlighten
us
about
ethnic
stereotypes
by
reversing
them
.

For
instance
,
Michael
dislikes
Jackie
not
because
he
's
a
shrewd
Jewish
businessman
,
but
because
he
quits
his
well-paying
job
as
a
salesman
in
order
to
become
a
social
worker
.

Even
more
problematic
is
the
incompatibility
between
sitcom
preachiness
and
Mr.
Mason
's
comic
persona
.

The
best
moments
in
the
show
occur
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
(
and
occasionally
in
the
middle
)
,
when
Mr.
Mason
slips
into
his
standup
mode
and
starts
meting
out
that
old-fashioned
Jewish
mischief
to
other
people
as
well
as
to
himself
.

But
too
often
,
these
routines
lack
spark
because
this
sitcom
,
like
all
sitcoms
,
is
timid
about
confronting
Mr.
Mason
's
stock
in
trade
-
ethnic
differences
.

I
'm
not
suggesting
that
the
producers
start
putting
together
episodes
about
topics
like
the
Catholic-Jewish
dispute
over
the
Carmelite
convent
at
Auschwitz
.

That
issue
,
like
racial
tensions
in
New
York
City
,
will
have
to
cool
down
,
not
heat
up
,
before
it
can
simmer
.

But
I
am
suggesting
that
they
stop
requiring
Mr.
Mason
to
interrupt
his
classic
shtik
with
some
line
about
``
caring
for
other
people
''
that
would
sound
shmaltzy
on
the
lips
of
Miss
America
.

At
your
age
,
Jackie
,
you
ought
to
know
that
you
ca
n't
make
soup
without
turning
up
the
flame
.

The
official
White
House
reaction
to
a
plunge
in
stock
prices
has
a
60-year
history
of
calm
,
right
up
through
Friday
.

Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
said
in
a
statement
Friday
that
the
stock-market
decline
``
does
n't
signal
any
fundamental
change
in
the
condition
of
the
economy
.

''
``
The
economy
,
''
he
added
,
``
remains
well-balanced
and
the
outlook
is
for
continued
moderate
growth
.

''
Sound
familiar
?
Here
's
what
Ronald
Reagan
said
after
the
1987
crash
:
``
The
underlying
economy
remains
sound
.

There
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
economy
...
all
the
indices
are
up
.

''
Heard
that
before
?
After
the
1929
crash
,
Herbert
Hoover
said
:
``
The
fundamental
business
of
the
country
...
is
on
a
sound
and
prosperous
basis
.

The
Senate
's
decision
to
approve
a
bare-bones
deficit-reduction
bill
without
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
still
leaves
open
the
possibility
of
enacting
a
gains
tax
reduction
this
year
.

Late
Friday
night
,
the
Senate
voted
87-7
to
approve
an
estimated
$
13.5
billion
measure
that
had
been
stripped
of
hundreds
of
provisions
that
would
have
widened
,
rather
than
narrowed
,
the
federal
budget
deficit
.

Lawmakers
drastically
streamlined
the
bill
to
blunt
criticism
that
it
was
bloated
with
special-interest
tax
breaks
and
spending
increases
.

``
We
're
putting
a
deficit-reduction
bill
back
in
the
category
of
being
a
deficit-reduction
bill
,
''
said
Senate
Budget
Committee
Chairman
James
Sasser
(
D.
,
Tenn
.

)
.

But
Senate
supporters
of
the
trimmer
legislation
said
that
other
bills
would
soon
be
moving
through
Congress
that
could
carry
some
of
the
measures
that
had
been
cast
aside
,
including
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
.

In
addition
,
the
companion
deficit-reduction
bill
already
passed
by
the
House
includes
a
capital-gains
provision
.

House-Senate
negotiations
are
likely
to
begin
at
midweek
and
last
for
a
while
.

``
No
one
can
predict
exactly
what
will
happen
on
the
House
side
,
''
said
Senate
Minority
Leader
Robert
Dole
(
R.
,
Kan
.

)
.

But
,
he
added
,
``
I
believe
Republicans
and
Democrats
will
work
together
to
get
capital-gains
reform
this
year
.

''
White
House
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
told
reporters
yesterday
that
the
administration
would
n't
push
to
keep
the
capital-gains
cut
in
the
final
version
of
the
bill
.

``
We
do
n't
need
this
as
a
way
to
get
capital
gains
,
''
he
said
.

House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Leon
Panetta
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
said
in
an
interview
,
``
If
that
's
the
signal
that
comes
from
the
White
House
,
that
will
help
a
great
deal
.

''
The
Senate
's
decision
was
a
setback
for
President
Bush
and
will
make
approval
of
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
less
certain
this
year
.

Opponents
of
the
cut
are
playing
hardball
.

Senate
Majority
Leader
George
Mitchell
(
D.
,
Maine
)
said
he
was
``
confident
''
that
any
House-Senate
agreement
on
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
would
n't
include
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
.

And
a
senior
aide
to
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
,
where
tax
legislation
originates
,
said
there
are
n't
any
``
plans
to
produce
another
tax
bill
that
could
carry
a
gains
tax
cut
this
year
.

''
One
obvious
place
to
attach
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
,
and
perhaps
other
popular
items
stripped
from
the
deficit-reduction
bill
,
is
the
legislation
to
raise
the
federal
borrowing
limit
.

Such
legislation
must
be
enacted
by
the
end
of
the
month
.

The
Senate
bill
was
pared
back
in
an
attempt
to
speed
deficit-reduction
through
Congress
.

Because
the
legislation
has
n't
been
completed
,
President
Bush
has
until
midnight
tonight
to
enact
across-the-board
spending
cuts
mandated
by
the
Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction
law
.

Senators
hope
that
the
need
to
avoid
those
cuts
will
pressure
the
House
to
agree
to
the
streamlined
bill
.

The
House
appears
reluctant
to
join
the
senators
.

A
key
is
whether
House
Republicans
are
willing
to
acquiesce
to
their
Senate
colleagues
'
decision
to
drop
many
pet
provisions
.

``
Although
I
am
encouraged
by
the
Senate
action
,
''
said
Chairman
Dan
Rostenkowski
(
D.
,
Ill
.

)
of
the
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
,
``
it
is
uncertain
whether
a
clean
bill
can
be
achieved
in
the
upcoming
conference
with
the
Senate
.

''
Another
big
question
hovering
over
the
debate
is
what
President
Bush
thinks
.

He
has
been
resisting
a
stripped-down
bill
without
a
guaranteed
vote
on
his
capital-gains
tax
cut
.

But
Republican
senators
saw
no
way
to
overcome
a
procedural
hurdle
and
garner
the
60
votes
needed
to
win
the
capital-gains
issue
on
the
floor
,
so
they
went
ahead
with
the
streamlined
bill
.

The
Senate
bill
was
stripped
of
many
popular
,
though
revenue-losing
,
provisions
,
a
number
of
which
are
included
in
the
House-passed
bill
.

These
include
a
child-care
initiative
and
extensions
of
soon-to-expire
tax
breaks
for
low-income
housing
and
research-and-development
expenditures
.

Also
missing
from
the
Senate
bill
is
the
House
's
repeal
of
a
law
,
called
Section
89
,
that
compels
companies
to
give
rank-and-file
workers
comparable
health
benefits
to
top
paid
executives
.

One
high-profile
provision
that
was
originally
in
the
Senate
bill
but
was
cut
out
because
it
lost
money
was
the
proposal
by
Chairman
Lloyd
Bentsen
(
D.
,
Texas
)
of
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
to
expand
the
deduction
for
individual
retirement
accounts
.

Mr.
Bentsen
said
he
hopes
the
Senate
will
consider
that
measure
soon
.

To
the
delight
of
some
doctors
,
the
bill
dropped
a
plan
passed
by
the
Finance
Committee
that
would
have
overhauled
the
entire
physician-reimbursement
system
under
Medicare
.

To
the
detriment
of
many
low-income
people
,
efforts
to
boost
Medicaid
funding
,
especially
in
rural
areas
,
also
were
stricken
.

Asked
why
senators
were
giving
up
so
much
,
New
Mexico
Sen.
Pete
Domenici
,
the
ranking
Republican
on
the
Senate
Budget
Committee
,
said
,
``
We
're
looking
like
idiots
.

Things
had
just
gone
too
far
.

''
Sen.
Dole
said
that
the
move
required
sacrifice
by
every
senator
.

It
worked
,
others
said
,
because
there
were
no
exceptions
:
all
revenue-losing
provisions
were
stricken
.

The
Senate
also
dropped
a
plan
by
its
Finance
Committee
that
would
have
increased
the
income
threshold
beyond
which
senior
citizens
have
their
Social
Security
benefits
reduced
.

In
addition
,
the
bill
dropped
a
plan
to
make
permanent
a
3
%
excise
tax
on
long-distance
telephone
calls
.

It
no
longer
includes
a
plan
that
would
have
repealed
what
remains
of
the
completed-contract
method
of
accounting
,
which
is
used
by
military
contractors
to
reduce
their
tax
burden
.

It
also
drops
a
provision
that
would
have
permitted
corporations
to
use
excess
pension
funds
to
pay
health
benefits
for
current
retirees
.

Also
stricken
was
a
fivefold
increase
in
the
maximum
Occupational
Safety
and
Health
Administration
penalties
,
which
would
have
raised
$
65
million
in
fiscal
1990
.

A
provision
that
would
have
made
the
Social
Security
Administration
an
independent
agency
was
excised
.

The
approval
of
the
Senate
bill
was
especially
sweet
for
Sen.
Mitchell
,
who
had
proposed
the
streamlining
.

Mr.
Mitchell
's
relations
with
Budget
Director
Darman
,
who
pushed
for
a
capital-gains
cut
to
be
added
to
the
measure
,
have
been
strained
since
Mr.
Darman
chose
to
bypass
the
Maine
Democrat
and
deal
with
other
lawmakers
earlier
this
year
during
a
dispute
over
drug
funding
in
the
fiscal
1989
supplemental
spending
bill
.

The
deficit
reduction
bill
contains
$
5.3
billion
in
tax
increases
in
fiscal
1990
,
and
$
26
billion
over
five
years
.

The
revenue-raising
provisions
,
which
affect
mostly
corporations
,
would
:
--
Prevent
companies
that
have
made
leveraged
buy-outs
from
getting
federal
tax
refunds
resulting
from
losses
caused
by
interest
payments
on
debt
issued
to
finance
the
buy-outs
,
effective
Aug.
2
,
1989
.

--
Require
mutual
funds
to
include
in
their
taxable
income
dividends
paid
to
them
on
the
date
that
the
dividends
are
declared
rather
than
received
,
effective
the
day
after
the
tax
bill
is
enacted
.

--
Close
a
loophole
regarding
employee
stock
ownership
plans
,
effective
June
6
,
1989
,
that
has
been
exploited
by
investment
bankers
in
corporate
takeovers
.

The
measure
repeals
a
50
%
exclusion
given
to
banks
on
the
interest
from
loans
used
to
acquire
securities
for
an
ESOP
,
if
the
ESOP
owns
less
than
30
%
of
the
employer
's
stock
.

--
Curb
junk
bonds
by
ending
tax
benefits
for
certain
securities
,
such
as
zero-coupon
bonds
,
that
postpone
cash
interest
payments
.

--
Raise
$
851
million
by
suspending
for
one
year
an
automatic
reduction
in
airport
and
airway
taxes
.

--
Speed
up
the
collection
of
the
payroll
tax
from
large
companies
,
effective
August
1990
.

--
Impose
a
tax
on
ozone-depleting
chemicals
,
such
as
those
used
in
air
conditioners
and
in
Styrofoam
,
beginning
at
$
1.10
a
pound
starting
next
year
.

--
Withhold
income
taxes
from
the
paychecks
of
certain
farm
workers
currently
exempt
from
withholding
.

--
Change
the
collection
of
gasoline
excise
taxes
to
weekly
from
semimonthly
,
effective
next
year
.

--
Restrict
the
ability
of
real
estate
owners
to
escape
taxes
by
swapping
one
piece
of
property
for
another
instead
of
selling
it
for
cash
.

--
Increase
to
$
6
a
person
from
$
3
the
international
air-passenger
departure
tax
,
and
impose
a
$
3-a-person
tax
on
international
departures
by
commercial
ships
.

The
measure
also
includes
spending
cuts
and
increases
in
federal
fees
.

Among
its
provisions
:
--
Reduction
of
Medicare
spending
in
fiscal
1990
by
some
$
2.8
billion
,
in
part
by
curbing
increases
in
reimbursements
to
physicians
.

The
plan
would
impose
a
brief
freeze
on
physician
fees
next
year
.

--
Removal
of
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
's
operating
budget
from
the
federal
budget
,
reducing
the
deficit
by
$
1.77
billion
.

A
similar
provision
is
in
the
House
version
.

--
Authority
for
the
Federal
Aviation
Administration
to
raise
$
239
million
by
charging
fees
for
commercial
airline-landing
rights
at
New

LaGuardia
and
John
F.

O'Hare

.

--
Increases
in
Nuclear
Regulatory
Commission
fees
totaling
$
54
million
.

--
Direction
to
the
U.S.
Coast
Guard
to
collect
$
50
million
from
users
of
Coast
Guard
services
.

--
Raising
an
additional
$
43

by
increasing
existing
Federal
Communications

and
establishing
new

for
amateur

In

lasts
(

Sept.

:
I
am
in
the
communications

above

I
was
laid
off
in
August
1988
,
and
after
a
thorough
and
exhausting
job
search
,
was
hired
in
August
1989
.

My
unemployment
insurance
ran
out
before
I
found
a
job
;
I
found
cutbacks
and
layoffs
in
many
companies
.

The
statistics
quoted

the
``

(
garnered
from
1984

are
out

certainly
as
an

for
the
Northeast

and
possibly
for
the
rest
of
the

.

I
think
what
bothered
me
most
about
the

was
that
there
seemed
to
be
an
underlying
attitude
to
tell
your

all
is
well
--
if
you
're
getting
laid
off
do
n't
worry
,
and
if
you
're
unemployed
,
it
's
a
seller
's
market
.

To
top
it
off
,
you
captioned
the
graph
showing
the
average
number
of

in
a
job
search
as
``
Time

''
Are
you
kidding
?
Looking
for
a
job
was
one
of
the
most
anxious
periods
of
my
life
--
and
is
for
most
people
.

Your

Moody
's
Investors
Service
said
it
reduced
its
rating
on
$
165
million
of
subordinated
debt
of
this
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
thrift
,
citing
turmoil
in
the
market
for
low-grade
,
high-yield
securities
.

The
agency
said
it
reduced
its
rating
on
the
thrift
's
subordinated
debt
to
B-2
from
Ba-2
and
will
keep
the
debt
under
review
for
possible
further
downgrade
.

Columbia
Savings
is
a
major
holder
of
so-called
junk
bonds
.

New
federal
legislation
requires
that
all
thrifts
divest
themselves
of
such
speculative
securities
over
a
period
of
years
.

Columbia
Savings
officials
were
n't
available
for
comment
on
the
downgrade
.

FRANKLIN
SAVINGS
ASSOCIATION
(
Ottawa
,
Kan.
)
--
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
it
downgraded
its
rating
to
B-2
from
Ba-3
on
less
than
$
20
million
of
this
thrift
's
senior
subordinated
notes
.

The
rating
concern
said
Franklin
's
``
troubled
diversification
record
in
the
securities
business
''
was
one
reason
for
the
downgrade
,
citing
the
troubles
at
its
L.F.
Rothschild
subsidiary
and
the
possible
sale
of
other
subsidiaries
.

``
They
perhaps
had
concern
that
we
were
getting
out
of
all
these
,
''
said
Franklin
President
Duane
H.
Hall
.

``
I
think
it
was
a
little
premature
on
their
part
.

''
Just
when
it
seemed
safe
to
go
back
into
stocks
,
Wall
Street
suffered
another
severe
attack
of
nerves
.

Does
this
signal
another
Black
Monday
is
coming
?
Or
is
this
an
extraordinary
buying
opportunity
,
just
like
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
eventually
turned
out
to
be
?
Here
's
what
several
leading
market
experts
and
money
managers
say
about
Friday
's
action
,
what
happens
next
and
what
investors
should
do
.

Joseph
Granville
.

``
I
'm
the
only
one
who
said
there
would
be
an
October
massacre
,
all
through
late
August
and
September
,
''
says
Mr.
Granville
,
once
a
widely
followed
market
guru
and
still
a
well-known
newsletter
writer
.

``
Everyone
will
tell
you
that
this
time
is
different
from
1987
,
''
he
says
.

``
Well
,
in
some
ways
it
is
different
,
but
technically
it
is
just
the
same
.

If
you
're
a
technician
,
you
obey
the
signals
.

Right
now
they
're
telling
me
to
get
the
hell
out
and
stay
out
.

I
see
no
major
support
until
2200
.

I
see
a
possibility
of
going
to
2200
this
month
.

''
Mr.
Granville
says
he
would
n't
even
think
of
buying
until
at
least
600
to
700
stocks
have
hit
52-week
lows
;
about
100
stocks
hit
new
lows
Friday
.

``
Most
people
,
''
he
says
,
``
have
no
idea
what
a
massacre
pattern
looks
like
.

''
Elaine
Garzarelli
.

A
quantitative
analyst
with
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
,
Ms.
Garzarelli
had
warned
clients
to
take
their
money
out
of
the
market
before
the
1987
crash
.

Friday
's
big
drop
,
she
says
,
``
was
not
a
crash
.

This
was
an
October
massacre
''
like
those
that
occurred
in
1978
and
1979
.

Now
,
as
in
those
two
years
,
her
stock
market
indicators
are
positive
.

So
she
thinks
the
damage
will
be
short-lived
and
contained
.

``
Those
corrections
lasted
one
to
four
weeks
and
took
the
market
10%-12
%
down
,
''
she
says
.

``
This
is
exactly
the
same
thing
,
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
.

''
Thus
,
she
says
,
if
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
dropped
below
2450
,
``
It
would
just
be
a
fluke
.

My
advice
is
to
buy
.

''
As
she
calculates
it
,
the
average
stock
now
sells
for
about
12.5
times
companies
'
earnings
.

She
says
that
ratio
could
climb
to
14.5
,
given
current
interest
rates
,
and
still
be
within
the
range
of
``
fair
value
.

''
Ned
Davis
.

Friday
's
fall
marks
the
start
of
a
bear
market
,
says
Mr.
Davis
,
president
of
Ned
Davis
Research
Inc
.

But
Mr.
Davis
,
whose
views
are
widely
respected
by
money
managers
,
says
he
expects
no
1987-style
crash
.

``
There
was
a
unique
combination
in
1987
,
''
he
says
.

``
Margin
debt
was
at
a
record
high
.

There
was
tremendous
public
enthusiasm
for
stock
mutual
funds
.

The
main
thing
was
portfolio
insurance
,
''
a
mechanical
trading
system
intended
to
protect
an
investor
against
losses
.

``
A
hundred
billion
dollars
in
stock
was
subject
''
to
it
.

In
1987
,
such
selling
contributed
to
a
snowball
effect
.

Today
could
even
be
an
up
day
,
Mr.
Davis
says
,
if
major
brokerage
firms
agree
to
refrain
from
program
trading
.

Over
the
next
several
months
,
though
,
he
says
things
look
bad
.

``
I
think
the
market
will
be
heading
down
into
November
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
will
probably
have
a
year-end
rally
,
and
then
go
down
again
.

Sort
of
a
two-step
bear
market
.

''
He
expects
the
downturn
to
carry
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
down
to
around
2000
sometime
next
year
.

``
That
would
be
a
normal
bear
market
,
''
he
says
.

``
I
guess
that
's
my
forecast
.

''
Leon
G.
Cooperman
.

``
I
do
n't
think
the
market
is
going
through
another
October
'87
.

I
do
n't
think
that
's
the
case
at
all
,
''
says
Mr.
Cooperman
,
a
partner
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
and
chairman
of
Goldman
Sachs
Asset
Management
.

Mr.
Cooperman
sees
this
as
a
good
time
to
pick
up
bargains
,
but
he
does
n't
think
there
's
any
need
to
rush
.

``
I
expect
the
market
to
open
weaker
Monday
,
but
then
it
should
find
some
stability
.

''
He
ticks
off
several
major
differences
between
now
and
two
years
ago
.

Unlike
1987
,
interest
rates
have
been
falling
this
year
.

Unlike
1987
,
the
dollar
has
been
strong
.

And
unlike
1987
,
the
economy
does
n't
appear
to
be
in
any
danger
of
overheating
.

But
the
economy
's
slower
growth
this
year
also
means
the
outlook
for
corporate
profits
``
is
n't
good
,
''
he
says
.

``
So
it
's
a
very
mixed
bag
.

''
Thus
,
he
concludes
,
``
This
is
not
a
good
environment
to
be
fully
invested
''
in
stocks
.

``
If
I
had
come
into
Friday
on
margin
or
with
very
little
cash
in
the
portfolios
,
I
would
not
do
any
buying
.

But
we
came
into
Friday
with
a
conservative
portfolio
,
so
I
would
look
to
do
some
modest
buying
''
on
behalf
of
clients
.

``
We
're
going
to
look
for
some
of
the
better-known
companies
that
got
clocked
''
Friday
.

John
Kenneth
Galbraith
.

``
This
is
the
latest
manifestation
of
the
capacity
of
the
financial
community
for
recurrent
insanity
,
''
says
Mr.
Galbraith
,
an
economist
.

``
I
see
this
as
a
reaction
to
the
whole
junk
bond
explosion
,
''
he
says
.

``
The
explosion
of
junk
bonds
and
takeovers
has
lodged
a
lot
of
insecure
securities
in
the
hands
of
investors
and
loaded
the
corporations
that
are
the
objects
of
takeovers
or
feared
takeovers
with
huge
amounts
of
debt
rather
than
equity
.

This
has
both
made
investors
uneasy
and
the
corporations
more
vulnerable
.

''
Nevertheless
,
he
says
a
depression
does
n't
appear
likely
.

``
There
is
more
resiliency
in
the
economy
at
large
than
we
commonly
suppose
,
''
he
says
.

``
It
takes
more
error
now
to
have
a
major
depression
than
back
in
the
Thirties
--
much
as
the
financial
community
and
the
government
may
try
.

''
Mario
Gabelli
.

New
York
money
manager
Mario
Gabelli
,
an
expert
at
spotting
takeover
candidates
,
says
that
takeovers
are
n't
totally
gone
.

``
Companies
are
still
going
to
buy
companies
around
the
world
,
''
he
says
.

Examples
are
``
Ford
looking
at
Jaguar
,
BellSouth
looking
at
LIN
Broadcasting
.

''
These
sorts
of
takeovers
do
n't
require
junk
bonds
or
big
bank
loans
to
finance
them
,
so
Mr.
Gabelli
figures
they
will
continue
.

``
The
market
was
up
35
%
since
{
President
}
Bush
took
office
,
''
Mr.
Gabelli
says
,
so
a
correction
was
to
be
expected
.

He
thinks
another
crash
is
``
unlikely
,
''
and
says
he
was
``
nibbling
at
''
selected
stocks
during
Friday
's
plunge
.

``
Stocks
that
were
thrown
out
just
on
an
emotional
basis
are
a
great
opportunity
{
this
}
week
for
guys
like
me
,
''
he
says
.

Jim
Rogers
.

``
It
seems
to
me
that
this
is
the
pin
that
has
finally
pricked
the
balloon
,
''
says
Mr.
Rogers
,
a
professor
of
finance
at
Columbia
University
and
former
co-manager
of
one
of
the
most
successful
hedge
funds
in
history
,
Quantum
Fund
.

He
sees
``
economic
problems
,
financial
problems
''
ahead
for
the
U.S.
,
with
a
fairly
strong
possibility
of
a
recession
.

``
Friday
you
could
n't
sell
dollars
,
''
he
says
.

Dealers
``
would
give
you
a
quote
,
but
then
refuse
to
make
the
trade
.

''
If
the
dollar
stays
weak
,
he
says
,
that
will
add
to
inflationary
pressures
in
the
U.S.
and
make
it
hard
for
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
to
ease
interest
rates
very
much
.

Mr.
Rogers
wo
n't
decide
what
to
do
today
until
he
sees
how
the
London
and
Tokyo
markets
go
.

He
recommends
that
investors
sell
takeover-related
stocks
,
but
hang
on
to
some
other
stocks
--
especially
utilities
,
which
often
do
well
during
periods
of
economic
weakness
.

Frank
Curzio
.

Many
people
now
claim
to
have
predicted
the
1987
crash
.

Queens
newsletter
writer
Francis
X.
Curzio
actually
did
it
:
He
stated
in
writing
in
September
1987
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
likely
to
decline
about
500
points
the
following
month
.

Mr.
Curzio
says
what
happens
now
will
depend
a
good
deal
on
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
.

If
it
promptly
cuts
the
discount
rate
it
charges
on
loans
to
banks
,
he
says
,
``
That
could
quiet
things
down
.

''
If
not
,
``
We
could
go
to
2200
very
soon
.

''
Frank
W.
Terrizzi
.

Stock
prices
``
would
still
have
to
go
down
some
additional
amount
before
we
become
positive
on
stocks
,
''
says
Mr.
Terrizzi
,
president
and
managing
director
of
Renaissance
Investment
Management
Inc.
in
Cincinnati
.

Renaissance
,
which
manages
about
$
1.8
billion
,
drew
stiff
criticism
from
many
clients
earlier
this
year
because
it
pulled
entirely
out
of
stocks
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
and
thus
missed
a
strong
rally
.

Renaissance
is
keeping
its
money
entirely
in
cash
equivalents
,
primarily
U.S.
Treasury
bills
.

``
T-bills
probably
are
the
right
place
to
be
,
''
he
says
.

WSJ
Oct.
16
,
1989
)
Regarding
the
Oct.
3
letter
to
the
editor
from
Rep.
Tom
Lantos
,
chairman
of
the
House
Subcommittee
on
Employment
and
Housing
,
alleging
:
1
.

That
your
Sept.
28
editorial
``
Kangaroo
Committees
''
was
factually
inaccurate
and
deliberately
misleading
.

I
thought
your
editorial
was
factually
accurate
and
deliberately
elucidative
.

2
.

That
Mr.
Lantos
supported
the
rights
of
the
witnesses
to
take
the
Fifth
Amendment
.

Yes
,
he
did
.

As
I
watched
him
on
C-Span
,
I
heard
him
speak
those
lovely
words
about
the
Bill
of
Rights
,
which
he
quotes
from
the
transcript
of
the
hearings
.

He
did
repeat
those
nice
platitudes
several
times
as
an
indication
of
his
support
for
the
Constitution
.

He
used
about
56
words
defending
the
witnesses
'
constitutional
rights
.

Unfortunately
,
by
my
rough
guess
,
he
used
better
than
5,000
words
heaping
scorn
on
the
witnesses
for
exercising
the
Fifth
.

He
sandwiched
his
praise
of
constitutional
meat
between
large
loaves
of
bilious
commentary
.

As
your
editorial
rightly
pointed
out
,
Samuel
Pierce
,
former
HUD
secretary
,
and
Lance
Wilson
,
Mr.
Pierce
's
former
aide
,
``
are
currently
being
held
up
to
scorn
for
taking
the
Fifth
Amendment
.

''
That
certainly
is
not
the
supposed
``
distorted
reading
''
indicated
by
Mr.
Lantos
.

3
.

That
his
``
committee
does
not
deal
with
any
possible
criminal
activity
at
HUD
.

My
colleagues
and
I
fully
realize
we
are
not
a
court
...
etc
.

''
Absolute
rubbish
.

By
any
``
reasonable
man
''
criterion
,
Mr.
Lantos
and
his
colleagues
have
a
whole
bunch
of
people
tried
and
convicted
.

Apparently
,
their
verdict
is
in
.

Right
now
they
're
pursuing
evidence
.

That
's
not
a
bad
way
to
proceed
,
just
somewhat
different
from
standard
American
practice
.

How
was
that
practice
referred
to
when
I
was
in
school
?
Ah
,
yes
,
something
called
a
Star
Chamber
.

Of
course
,
Mr.
Lantos
doth
protest
that
his
subcommittee
simply
seeks
information
for
legislative
change
.

No
doubt
that
's
partially
true
.

Everything
that
Mr.
Lantos
says
in
his
letter
is
partially
true
.

He
's
right
about
his
subcommittee
's
responsibilities
when
it
comes
to
obtaining
information
from
prior
HUD
officials
.

But
if
his
explanation
of
motivation
is
true
,
why
is
his
investigation
so
oriented
as
to
identify
criminal
activity
?
Why
not
simply
questions
designed
to
identify
sources
and
causes
of
waste
and
inefficiency
?
Such
as
,
what
happened
when
Congress
wanted
to
know
about
$
400
toilet
seats
or
whatever
they
supposedly
cost
?
No
,
Mr.
Lantos
's
complaints
simply
wo
n't
wash
.

4
.

That
the
Journal
defends
``
the
sleaze
,
fraud
,
waste
,
embezzlement
,
influence-peddling
and
abuse
of
the
public
that
took
place
while
Mr.
Pierce
was
secretary
of
HUD
,
''
etc.
and
so
forth
.

No
,
to
my
mind
,
the
Journal
did
not
``
defend
sleaze
,
fraud
,
waste
,
embezzlement
,
influence-peddling
and
abuse
of
the
public
trust
...
''
it
defended
appropriate
constitutional
safeguards
and
practical
common
sense
.

The
problem
,
which
the
Journal
so
rightly
pointed
out
in
a
number
of
articles
,
is
not
the
likes
of
Mr.
Lantos
,
who
after
all
is
really
a
bit
player
on
the
stage
,
but
the
attempt
by
Congress
to
enhance
itself
into
a
body
.

(
Of
course
,
we
've
also
got
a
judiciary
that
seeks
the
same
objective
.

)
The
system
is
the
problem
,
not
an
individual
member
.

Individuals
can
always
have
their
hands
slapped
.

It
's
when
such
slapping
does
n't
occur
that
we
've
got
trouble
.

I
do
not
by
any
means
defend
HUD
management
.

But
I
think
the
kind
of
congressional
investigation
that
has
been
pursued
is
a
far
greater
danger
to
American
notions
of
liberty
and
freedom
than
any
incompetency
(
and
,
yes
,
maybe
criminality
)
within
HUD
could
possibly
generate
.

The
last
time
I
saw
a
similar
congressional
hearing
was
when
``
Tail

''
McCarthy
did
his
work

I
disagree
with
the
statement
by
Mr.
Lantos
that
one
should
not
draw
an
adverse
inference
against
former
HUD
officials
who
assert
their
Fifth
Amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination
in
congressional
hearings
.

The
Fifth
Amendment
states
in
relevant
part
that
no
person
``
shall
be
compelled
,
in
any
criminal
case
,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
.

''
This
privilege
against
self-incrimination
precludes
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
not
to
testify
.

Thus
,
in
a
criminal
case
,
a
prosecutor
can
not
comment
on
a
defendant
's
failure
to
testify
nor
can
the
defendant
be
compelled
to
take
the
stand
as
a
witness
,
thus
forcing
him
to
``
take
the
Fifth
.

''
The
privilege
,
however
,
has
been
limited
in
accordance
with
its
plain
language
to
protect
the
defendant
in
criminal
matters
only
.

The
Supreme
Court
and
some
states
have
specifically
recognized
that
``
the
Fifth
Amendment
does
not
preclude
the
inference
where
the
privilege
is
claimed
by
a
party
to
a
civil
cause
.

''
Baxter
v.
Palmingiano
,
425
U.S.
308
(
1976
)
.

Thus
,
in
a
civil
case
,
a
defendant
may
be
called
as
a
witness
,
he
may
be
forced
to
testify
or
take
the
Fifth
,
and
his
taking
of
the
Fifth
may
permit
the
drawing
of
an
adverse
inference
against
him
in
the
civil
matter
.

He
may
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
only
if
he
has
a
good
faith
and
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
may
subject
him
to
criminal
prosecution
.

Allowing
the
defendant
to
take
the
Fifth
in
a
civil
matter
is
not
based
on
a
constitutional
right
to
refuse
to
testify
where
one
's
testimony
harms
him
in
the
civil
matter
,
but
because
the
testimony
in
the
civil
matter
could
be
unconstitutionally
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.

Absent
the
risk
of
such
prosecution
,
a
court
may
order
the
defendant
to
testify
.

Thus
,
when
Mr.
Pierce
asserted
the
Fifth
in
a
noncriminal
proceeding
,
particularly
after
presumably
receiving
extensive
advice
from
legal
counsel
,
one
must
conclude
that
he
held
a
good-faith
,
justifiable
belief
that
his
testimony
could
be
used
against
him
in
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
.

The
subcommittee
,
Congress
and
the
American
public
have
every
right
to
draw
the
adverse
inference
and
to
concur
with
Mr.
Pierce
's
own
belief
that
his
testimony
could
help
convict
him
of
a
crime
.

Drawing
the
adverse
inference
in
a
noncriminal
congressional
hearing
does
not
offend
the
Fifth
Amendment
shield
against
self-incrimination
.

It
was
Friday
the
13th
,
and
the
stock
market
plummeted
nearly
200
points
.

Just
a
coincidence
?
Or
is
triskaidekaphobia
--
fear
of
the
number
13
--
justified
?
In
academia
,
a
so-called
Friday
the
13th
effect
has
been
set
up
and
shot
down
by
different
professors
.

Robert
Kolb
and
Ricardo
Rodriguez
,
professors
of
finance
at
the
University
of
Miami
,
found
evidence
that
the
market
is
spooked
by
Friday
the
13th
.

But
their
study
,
which
spanned
the
1962-85
period
,
has
since
been
shown
to
be
jinxed
by
an
unlucky
choice
of
data
.

In
the
'70s
,
the
market
took
falls
nine
times
in
a
row
on
Friday
the
you-know-what
.

But
the
date
tends
to
be
a
plus
,
not
a
minus
,
for
stocks
,
according
to
Yale
Hirsch
,
a
collector
of
stock
market
lore
.

Another
study
found
that
the
82
Fridays
the
13th
in
the
1940-1987
period
had
higher
than
average
returns
--
higher
even
than
Fridays
in
general
,
which
tend
to
be
strong
days
for
stock
prices
.

On
the
only
other
Friday
the
13th
this
year
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rose
about
four
points
.

Professor
Kolb
says
the
original
study
,
titled
Friday
the
13th
,
Part
VII
,
was
published
tongue-in-cheek
.

In
a
similar
vein
,
he
adds
that
the
anniversary
of
the
1987
crash
and
Saturday
's
full
moon
could
have
played
a
part
,
too
,
in
Friday
's
market
activity
.

reminiscent
of
those
during
the
1987
crash
--
that
as
stock
prices
plummeted
and
trading
activity
escalated
,
some
phone
calls
to
market
makers
in
over-the-counter
stocks
went
unanswered
.

``
We
could
n't
get
dealers
to
answer
their
phones
,
''
said
Robert
King
,
senior
vice
president
of
OTC
trading
at
Robinson-Humphrey
Co.
in
Atlanta
.

``
It
was
{
like
}
the
Friday
before
Black
Monday
''
two
years
ago
.

Whether
unanswered
phone
calls
had
any
effect
or
not
,
Nasdaq
stocks
sank
far
less
than
those
on
the
New
York
and
American
exchanges
.

Nonetheless
,
the
Nasdaq
Composite
Index
suffered
its
biggest
point
decline
of
the
year
and
its
sixth
worst
ever
,
diving
14.90
,
or
3
%
,
to
467.29
.

Ten
points
of
the
drop
occurred
during
the
last
45
minutes
of
trading
.

By
comparison
,
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
Composite
tumbled
5.8
%
Friday
and
the
American
Stock
Exchange
Composite
fell
4
%
.

On
Oct.
16
,
1987
,
the
Nasdaq
Composite
fell
16.18
points
,
or
3.8
%
,
followed
by
its
devastating
46.12-point
,
or
11
%
slide
,
three
days
later
.

Nasdaq
volume
Friday
totaled
167.7
million
shares
,
which
was
only
the
fifth
busiest
day
so
far
this
year
.

The
single-day
record
of
288
million
shares
was
set
on
Oct.
21
,
``
There
was
n't
a
lot
of
volume
because
it
was
just
impossible
to
get
stock
moved
,
''
said
E.E.
``
Buzzy
''
Geduld
,
president
of
Herzog
,
Heine
,
Geduld
,
a
New
York
company
that
makes
markets
in
thousands
of
OTC
issues
.

Most
of
the
complaints
about
unanswered
phone
calls
came
from
regional
brokers
rather
than
individual
investors
.

Mr.
King
of
Robinson-Humphrey
and
others
were
quick
to
add
that
they
believe
the
problem
stemmed
more
from
traders
'
inability
to
handle
the
volume
of
calls
,
rather
than
a
deliberate
attempt
to
avoid
making
trades
.

The
subject
is
a
sore
one
for
Nasdaq
and
its
market-making
companies
,
which
were
widely
criticized
two
years
ago
following
complaints
from
investors
who
could
n't
reach
their
brokers
or
trade
in
the
chaos
of
the
crash
.

Peter
DaPuzzo
,
head
of
retail
equity
trading
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
,
declared
:
``
It
was
the
last
hour
of
trading
on
a
Friday
.

There
were
too
many
phones
ringing
and
too
many
things
happening
to
expect
market
makers
to
be
as
efficient
as
robots
.

It
was
n't
intentional
,
we
were
all
busy
.

''
James
Tarantino
,
head
of
OTC
trading
at
Hambrecht
&
Quist
in
San
Francisco
,
said
,
``
It
was
just
like
two
years
ago
.

Everybody
was
trying
to
do
the
same
thing
at
the
same
time
.

''
Jeremiah
Mullins
,
the
OTC
trading
chief
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
in
New
York
,
said
proudly
that
his
company
executed
every
order
it
received
by
the
close
of
trading
.

But
,
he
added
,
``
you
can
only
take
one
call
at
a
time
.

''
Market
makers
keep
supplies
of
stock
on
hand
to
maintain
orderly
trading
when
imbalances
occur
.

On
days
like
Friday
,
that
means
they
must
buy
shares
from
sellers
when
no
one
else
is
willing
to
.

When
selling
is
so
frenzied
,
prices
fall
steeply
and
fast
.

Two
years
ago
,
faced
with
the
possibility
of
heavy
losses
on
the
stocks
in
their
inventories
,
market
makers
themselves
began
dumping
shares
,
exacerbating
the
slide
in
OTC
stock
prices
.

On
Friday
,
some
market
makers
were
selling
again
,
traders
said
.

But
,
with
profits
sagging
on
Wall
Street
since
the
crash
,
companies
have
kept
smaller
share
stockpiles
on
hand
.

Mr.
Tarantino
of
Hambrecht
&
Quist
said
some
prices
fell
without
trades
taking
place
,
as
market
makers
kept
dropping
the
prices
at
which
they
would
buy
shares
.

``
Everyone
was
hitting
everyone
else
's
bid
,
''
he
said
.

So
,
while
OTC
companies
incurred
losses
on
Friday
,
trading
officials
said
the
damage
was
n't
as
bad
as
it
was
in
1987
.

``
Two
years
ago
we
were
carrying
huge
inventories
and
that
was
the
big
culprit
.

I
do
n't
know
of
anyone
carrying
big
inventories
now
,
''
said
Mr.
King
of
Robinson-Humphrey
.

Tony
Cecin
,
head
of
equity
trading
at
Piper
,
Jaffray
&
Hopwood
in
Minneapolis
,
said
that
Piper
Jaffray
actually
made
money
on
Friday
.

It
helped
that
his
inventory
is
a
third
smaller
now
than
it
was
two
years
ago
,
he
said
.

Joseph
Hardiman
,
president
of
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
which
oversees
the
Nasdaq
computerized
trading
system
,
said
that
despite
the
rush
of
selling
,
he
never
considered
the
situation
an
``
emergency
.

''
``
The
pace
of
trading
was
orderly
,
''
he
said
.

Nasdaq
's
Small
Order
Execution
System
``
worked
beautifully
,
''
as
did
the
automated
system
for
larger
trades
,
according
to
Mr.
Hardiman
.

Nevertheless
,
the
shock
of
another
steep
plunge
in
stock
prices
undoubtedly
will
shake
many
investors
'
confidence
.

In
the
past
,
the
OTC
market
thrived
on
a
firm
base
of
small-investor
participation
.

Because
Nasdaq
's
trading
volume
has
n't
returned
to
pre-crash
levels
,
traders
and
OTC
market
officials
hope
the
damage
wo
n't
be
permanent
.

But
they
are
worried
.

``
We
were
just
starting
to
get
the
public
's
confidence
back
,
''
lamented
Mr.
Mullins
of
Dean
Witter
.

More
troubling
is
the
prospect
that
the
overall
collapse
in
stock
prices
could
permanently
erode
the
base
of
small-investor
support
the
OTC
market
was
struggling
to
rebuild
in
the
wake
of
the
October
1987
crash
.

Mr.
Cecin
of
Piper
Jaffray
says
some
action
from
government
policy
makers
would
allay
investor
fears
.

It
wo
n't
take
much
more
to
``
scare
the
hell
out
of
retail
investors
,
''
he
says
.

The
sellers
on
Friday
came
from
all
corners
of
the
OTC
market
--
big
and
small
institutional
investors
,
as
well
as
individual
investors
and
market
makers
.

But
grateful
traders
said
the
sell
orders
generally
ranged
from
20,000
shares
to
50,000
shares
,
compared
with
blocks
of
500,000
shares
or
more
two
years
ago
.

Shearson
's
Mr.
DaPuzzo
said
retail
investors
nervously
sold
stock
Friday
and
never
returned
to
bargain-hunt
.

Institutional
investors
,
which
had
been
selling
stock
throughout
last
week
to
lock
in
handsome
gains
made
through
the
third
quarter
,
were
calmer
.

``
We
had
a
good
amount
of
selling
from
institutions
,
but
not
as
much
panic
,
''
Mr.
DaPuzzo
said
.

``
If
they
could
n't
sell
,
some
of
them
put
the
shares
back
on
the
shelf
.

''
In
addition
,
he
said
,
some
bigger
institutional
investors
placed
bids
to
buy
some
OTC
stocks
whose
prices
were
beaten
down
.

In
addition
,
Mr.
DaPuzzo
said
computer-guided
program
selling
of
OTC
stocks
in
the
Russell
Index
of
2000
small
stocks
and
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
Index
sent
occasional
``
waves
``
through
the
market
.

Nasdaq
's
biggest
stocks
were
hammered
.

The
Nasdaq
100
Index
of
the
largest
nonfinancial
issues
,
including
the
big
OTC
technology
issues
,
tumbled
4.2
%
,
or
19.76
,
to
449.33
.

The
Nasdaq
Financial
Index
of
giant
insurance
and
banking
stocks
dropped
2
%
,
or
9.31
,
to
462.98
.

The
OTC
market
has
only
a
handful
of
takeover-related
stocks
.

But
they
fell
sharply
.

McCaw
Cellular
Communications
,
for
instance
,
has
offered
to
buy
LIN
Broadcasting
as
well
as
Metromedia
's
New
York
City
cellular
telephone
interests
,
and
in
a
separate
transaction
,
sell
certain
McCaw
properties
to
Contel
Cellular
.

McCaw
lost
8
%
,
or
3
,
to
40
.

LIN
Broadcasting
,
dropped
5
,
or
5
%
,
to
107
.

The
turnover
in
both
issues
was
roughly
normal
.

On
a
day
when
negative
takeover-related
news
did
n't
sit
well
with
investors
,
Commercial
Intertech
,
a
maker
of
engineered
metal
parts
,
said
Haas
&
Partners
advised
it
that
it
does
n't
plan
to
pursue
its
previously
reported
$
27.50-a-share
bid
to
buy
the
company
.

Commercial
Intertech
plummeted
6
to
26
.

The
issues
of
companies
with
ties
to
the
junk
bond
market
also
tumbled
Friday
.

On
the
OTC
market
,
First
Executive
,
a
big
buyer
of
the
high-risk
,
high-yield
issues
,

Pension
funds
,
insurers
and
other
behemoths
of
the
investing
world
said
they
began
scooping
up
stocks
during
Friday
's
market
rout
.

And
they
plan
to
buy
more
today
.

Rightly
or
wrongly
,
many
giant
institutional
investors
appear
to
be
fighting
the
latest
war
by
applying
the
lesson
they
learned
in
the
October
1987
crash
:
Buying
at
the
bottom
pays
off
.

To
be
sure
,
big
investors
might
put
away
their
checkbooks
in
a
hurry
if
stocks
open
sharply
lower
today
.

They
could
still
panic
and
bail
out
of
the
market
.

But
their
1987
performance
indicates
that
they
wo
n't
abandon
stocks
unless
conditions
get
far
worse
.

``
Last
time
,
we
got
rewarded
for
going
out
and
buying
stocks
when
the
panic
was
the
worst
,
''
said
John
W.
Rogers
,
president
of
Chicago-based
Ariel
Capital
Management
Inc.
,
which
manages
$
1.1
billion
of
stocks
.

Mr.
Rogers
spent
half
his
cash
on
hand
Friday
for
``
our
favorite
stocks
that
have
fallen
apart
.

''
He
expects
to
invest
the
rest
if
the
market
weakens
further
.

Denver-based
portfolio
manager
James
Craig
was
n't
daunted
when
Friday
's
rout
shaved
$
40
million
from
the
value
of
the
$
752
million
Janus
Fund
he
oversees
.

``
I
waited
to
make
sure
all
the
program
trades
had
kicked
through
,
''
he
said
.

Then
he
jumped
into
the
market
:
``
I
spent
$
30
million
in
the
last
half-hour
.

''
Other
money
managers
also
opened
their
wallets
.

``
I
was
buying
at
the
close
(
Friday
)
and
I
'll
be
buying
again
because
I
know
we
're
getting
good
value
,
''
said
Frederick
A.
Moran
,
president
of
Moran
Asset
Management
Inc.
,
Greenwich
,
Conn
.

``
There
is
no
justification
on
the
fundamental
level
for
this
crash
.

''
Unlike
mutual
funds
,
which
can
be
forced
to
sell
stockholdings
when
investors
rush
to
withdraw
money
,
big
investors
such
as
pension
funds
and
insurance
companies
can
decide
to
ride
out
market
storms
without
jettisoning
stock
.

Most
often
,
they
do
just
that
,
because
stocks
have
proved
to
be
the
best-performing
long-term
investment
,
attracting
about
$
1
trillion
from
pension
funds
alone
.

``
If
you
bought
after
the
crash
,
you
did
very
very
well
off
the
bottom
,
''
said
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Chicago-based
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc
.

The
$
56
billion
California
Public
Employees
Retirement
System
,
for
one
,
added
$
1
billion
to
its
stock
portfolio
two
years
ago
.

``
The
last
crash
taught
institutional
investors
that
they
have
to
be
long-term
holders
,
and
that
they
ca
n't
react
to
short-term
events
,
good
or
bad
,
''
said
Stephen
L.
Nesbitt
,
senior
vice
president
for
the
pension
consultants
Wilshire
Associates
in
Santa
Monica
,
Calif
.

``
Those
that
pulled
out
(
of
stocks
)
regretted
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
so
I
doubt
you
'll
see
any
significant
changes
''
in
institutional
portfolios
as
a
result
of
Friday
's
decline
.

Stocks
,
as
measured
by
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
have
been
stellar
performers
this
year
,
rising
27.97
%
before
Friday
's
plunge
,
excluding
dividends
.

Even
Friday
's
slump
leaves
investors
ahead
more
than
20
%
,
well
above
the
annual
average
for
stocks
over
several
decades
.

``
You
could
go
down
400
points
and
still
have
a
good
year
in
the
market
,
''
said
James
D.
Awad
,
president
of
New
York-based
BMI
Capital
Corp
.

Mr.
Awad
,
however
,
worries
that
the
market
``
could
go
down
800
or
900
points
in
the
next
few
days
.

It
can
happen
before
you
can
turn
around
.

''
He
said
he
discerns
many
parallels
with
1987
,
including
the
emphasis
on
takeover
stocks
and
the
re-emergence
of
computerized
program
trading
.

``
The
only
thing
you
do
n't
have
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
the
`
portfolio
insurance
'
phenomenon
overlaid
on
the
rest
.

''
Most
institutional
investors
have
abandoned
the
portfolio
insurance
hedging
technique
,
which
is
widely
thought
to
have
worsened
the
1987
crash
.

Not
really
insurance
,
this
tactic
was
designed
to
soften
the
blow
of
declining
stock
prices
and
generate
an
offsetting
profit
by
selling
waves
of
S&P
futures
contracts
.

In
its
severest
test
,
the
$
60
billion
of
portfolio
insurance
in
effect
in
the
1987
crash
did
n't
work
,
as
stock
buyers
disappeared
and
stock
and
futures
prices
became
disconnected
.

Even
without
portfolio
insurance
,
market
conditions
were
grim
Friday
,
money
managers
said
.

Neil
Weisman
,
whose
New
York-based
Chilmark
Capital
Partners
had
converted
85
%
of
its
$
220
million
investment
pool
to
cash
in
recent
months
,
said
he
was
besieged
by
Wall
Street
firms
Friday
asking
him
to
take
stock
off
their
hands
.

``
We
got
calls
from
big
block
houses
asking
us
if
we
want
to
make
bids
on
anything
,
''
said
Mr.
Weisman
,
who
,
happy
with
his
returns
on
investments
chalked
up
earlier
,
declined
the
offers
.

Mr.
Weisman
predicts
stocks
will
appear
to
stabilize
in
the
next
few
days
before
declining
again
,
trapping
more
investors
.

``
I
think
it
will
be
a
rigor
mortis
rally
,
''
he
said
.

Meanwhile
,
Friday
brought
a
reprieve
for
money
managers
whose
investment
styles
had
put
them
at
odds
with
the
market
rally
.

Especially
gleeful
were
the
short
sellers
,
who
have
been
pounded
by
this
year
's
market
climb
.

The
shorts
sell
borrowed
shares
,
hoping
to
profit
by
replacing
them
later
at
a
lower
price
.

The
nation
's
largest
short-selling
operation
is
Feshbach
Brothers
,
Palo
Alto
,
Calif.
,
which
said
last
May
that
its
short
positions
had
shown
losses
of
10
%
for
the
year
up
to
that
point
.

All
that
now
has
changed
.

``
We
're
ahead
for
the
year
because
of
Friday
,
''
said
the
firm
's
Kurt
Feshbach
.

``
We
're
not
making
a
killing
,
but
we
had
a
good
day
.

''
Food
and
Drug
Administration
spokesman
Jeff
Nesbit
said
the
agency
has
turned
over
evidence
in
a
criminal
investigation
concerning
Vitarine
Pharmaceuticals
Inc.
to
the
U.S.
Attorney
's
office
in
Baltimore
.

Neither
Vitarine
nor
any
of
the
Springfield
Gardens
,
N.Y.
,
company
's
officials
or
employees
have
been
charged
with
any
crimes
.

Vitarine
won
approval
to
market
a
version
of
a
blood
pressure
medicine
but
acknowledged
that
it
substituted
a
SmithKline
Beecham
PLC
product
as
its
own
in
tests
.

Mr.
Nesbit
also
said
the
FDA
has
asked
Bolar
Pharmaceutical
Co.
to
recall
at
the
retail
level
its
urinary
tract
antibiotic
.

But
so
far
the
company
has
n't
complied
with
that
request
,
the
spokesman
said
.

Bolar
,
the
subject
of
a
criminal
investigation
by
the
FDA
and
the
Inspector
General
's
office
of
the
Health
and
Human
Services
Department
,
only
agreed
to
recall
two
strengths
of
its
version
of
Macrodantin
``
as
far
down
as
direct
customers
,
mostly
wholesalers
,
''
Mr.
Nesbit
said
.

Bolar
,
of
Copiague
,
N.Y.
,
earlier
began
a
voluntary
recall
of
both
its
100
milligram
and
50
milligram
versions
of
the
drug
.

The
FDA
has
said
it
presented
evidence
it
uncovered
to
the
company
indicating
that
Bolar
substituted
the
brand-name
product
for
its
own
to
gain
government
approval
to
sell
generic
versions
of
Macrodantin
.

Bolar
has
denied
that
it
switched
the
brand-name
product
for
its
own
in
such
testing
.

The
West
German
retailer
ASKO
Deutsche
Kaufhaus
AG
plans
to
challenge
the
legality
of
a
widely
employed
anti-takeover
defense
of
companies
in
the
Netherlands
.

The
eventual
court
decision
could
become
a
landmark
in
Dutch
corporate
law
because
the
lawsuit
ASKO
plans
to
file
would
be
the
first
to
challenge
the
entire
principle
and
practice
of
companies
issuing
voting
preferred
shares
to
management-controlled
trusts
to
dilute
voting
power
of
common
stockholders
.

Up
to
now
only
specific
aspects
of
these
defenses
have
been
challenged
,
though
unsuccessfully
,
ASKO
's
Dutch
lawyers
noted
.

Should
the
courts
uphold
the
validity
of
this
type
of
defense
,
ASKO
will
then
ask
the
court
to
overturn
such
a
vote-diluting
maneuver
recently
deployed
by
Koninklijke
Ahold
NV
.

ASKO
says
the
Dutch-based
international
food
retailer
had
n't
reasonable
grounds
to
issue
preferred
stock
to
a
friendly
trust
and
thus
dilute
the
worth
and
voting
power
of
ASKO
and
other
shareholders
.

Speaking
through
its
Dutch
lawyers
,
ASKO
also
disclosed
it
holds
a
15
%
stake
in
Ahold
.

It
was
previously
thought
ASKO
held
a
13.6
%
stake
that
was
accumulated
since
July
.

A
spokesman
for
Ahold
said
his
company
is
confident
of
its
own
position
and
the
propriety
of
the
preferred-share
issue
.

He
termed
ASKO
's
legal
actions
as
``
unproductive
''
to
international
cooperation
among
European
retailers
.

Chase
Manhattan
Bank
Chairman
Willard
Butcher
is
a
conservative
banker
and
a
loyal
Republican
,
but
on
Friday
morning
he
had
few
kind
words
for
President
Bush
's
economic
policy-making
.

``
There
are
some
very
significant
issues
out
there
,
such
as
the
fiscal
deficit
,
the
trade
deficit
,
our
relations
with
Japan
,
that
have
to
be
the
subject
of
major
initiatives
,
''
he
said
in
an
interview
.

``
I
'd
like
to
see
that
initiative
,
and
I
have
n't
.

There
is
n't
a
big
shot
,
an
agenda
.

''
A
few
hours
later
,
the
stock
market
dropped
190
points
.

Politicians
tried
to
finger
each
other
for
the
blame
,
although
many
analysts
doubt
that
Washington
was
singly
responsible
for
Wall
Street
's
woes
.

But
Mr.
Butcher
's
comments
make
one
thing
clear
:
Some
on
Wall
Street
wonder
if
anyone
is
in
charge
of
economic
policy
.

Consider
this
:
--
By
11:59
p.m.
tonight
,
President
Bush
must
order
$
16
billion
of
automatic
,
across-the-board
cuts
in
government
spending
to
comply
with
the
Gramm-Rudman
budget
law
.

The
cuts
are
necessary
because
Congress
and
the
administration
have
failed
to
reach
agreement
on
a
deficit-cutting
bill
.

``
We
simply
do
n't
have
strong
leadership
to
try
to
reduce
the
deficit
and
make
tough
choices
,
''
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Leon
Panetta
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
said
yesterday
on
NBC
News
's
``
Meet
the
Press
.

''
--
For
the
last
two
weeks
,
the
Bush
administration
and
the
Federal
Reserve
have
been
engaged
in
a
semi-public
battle
over
international
economic
policy
.

The
administration
has
been
trying
to
push
the
dollar
lower
;
the
Fed
has
been
resisting
.

``
One
of
the
things
that
continues
to
worry
me
is
this
monetary
warfare
between
the
Treasury
Department
and
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
,
''
said
Lawrence
Kudlow
,
a
Bear
,
Stearns
&
Co.
economist
,
on
ABC
's
``
This
Week
.

''
--
The
administration
has
sent
out
confusing
signals
about
its
response
to
a
recent
spate
of
airline
takeovers
.

Last
month
,
Transportation
Secretary
Sam
Skinner
forced
Northwest
Airlines
to
reduce
a
stake
held
by
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
.

But
he
has
since
run
into
opposition
from
the
Treasury
and
the
White
House
over
that
decision
.

And
he
has
kept
mum
on
how
his
decision
might
affect
a
bid
for
United
Airlines
,
which
includes
a
big
stake
by
British
Airways
PLC
.

Some
analysts
say
uncertainty
about
Washington
's
anti-takeover
policy
was
one
reason
that
financing
for
the
United
Airlines
takeover
fell
through
--
the
event
that
triggered
the
market
drop
.

In
many
ways
,
the
backdrop
to
Friday
's
stock
decline
is
eerily
similar
to
that
of
October
1987
's
508-point
crash
.

Then
,
as
now
,
the
budget
debate
was
behind
schedule
and
automatic
spending
cuts
were
within
days
of
taking
hold
.

The
Treasury
was
locked
in
a
battle
over
international
economic
policy
,
although
at
that
time
it
was
with
West
German
officials
rather
than
the
Federal
Reserve
.

And
concern
about
official
actions
aimed
at
takeovers
--
then
by
the
tax-writing
House
Ways
and
Means
Committee
rather
than
the
Transportation
Department
--
were
making
markets
nervous
.

The
1987
crash
brought
the
Reagan
administration
and
Democratic
lawmakers
to
the
table
for
the
first
budget
summit
,
resulting
in
a
two-year
plan
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
more
than
$
76
billion
--
even
though
the
deficit
actually
rose
by
nearly
$
12
billion
during
that
period
.

But
,
barring
further
drops
in
the
market
this
week
,
a
similar
outcome
does
n't
seem
likely
this
year
.

Lawmakers
and
administration
officials
agree
that
Friday
's
drop
,
by
itself
,
is
n't
enough
to
force
both
sides
back
to
the
table
to
try
to
reach
a
deficit-reduction
agreement
that
would
be
more
serious
and
more
far-reaching
than
last
spring
's
gimmick-ridden
plan
,
which
still
is
n't
fully
implemented
.

One
of
the
biggest
reasons
that
new
talks
are
n't
likely
to
come
about
is
that
,
as
everyone
learned
in
1987
,
the
economy
and
the
market
can
survive
a
one-day
508-point
tumble
.

``
Everybody
thought
we
were
looking
at
a
repetition
of
1929
,
that
we
were
looking
at
a
recession
,
''
Rep.
Panetta
said
yesterday
in
an
interview
.

``
That
did
not
happen
.

They
learned
they
could
survive
it
without
much
problem
.

''
But
administration
officials
privately
agree
with
Mr.
Panetta
,
who
said
a
precipitous
drop
this
week
``
is
going
to
force
the
president
and
Congress
to
take
a
much
harder
look
at
fiscal
policy
.

''
In
that
case
,
there
will
be
plenty
of
blame
to
go
around
.

``
There
is
an
underlying
concern
on
the
part
of
the
American
people
--
and
there
should
be
-
that
the
administration
has
not
gone
far
enough
in
cutting
this
deficit
and
that
Congress
has
been
unwilling
to
cut
what
the
administration
asked
us
to
cut
,
''
said
Senate
Finance
Committee
Chairman
Lloyd
Bentsen
(
D.
,
Texas
)
.

Nevertheless
,
it
clearly
will
take
more
than
Friday
's
190-point
decline
to
overcome
the
bitter
feelings
that
have
developed
between
lawmakers
and
White
House
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
over
the
capital-gains
fight
.

Hill
Democrats
are
particularly
angry
over
Mr.
Bush
's
claim
that
the
capital-gains
cut
was
part
of
April
's
budget
accord
and
his
insistence
on
combining
it
with
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
.

``
There
is
no
prospect
of
any
so-called
grand
compromise
or
deal
next
year
because
the
administration
simply
did
n't
live
up
to
this
year
's
deal
,
''
Senate
Majority
Leader
George
Mitchell
(
D.
,
Maine
)
said
yesterday
on
CBS
News
's
``
Face
the
Nation
.

''
During
last
week
's
maneuverings
on
the
deficit-cutting
bill
and
the
capital-gains
issue
,
there
were
signs
that
Senate
Republicans
and
the
administration
were
at
odds
.

At
the
very
moment
that
Senate
Republicans
were
negotiating
a
deal
to
exclude
capital
gains
from
the
deficit-reduction
legislation
,
White
House
spokesman
Marlin
Fitzwater
told
reporters
that
it
was
the
president
's
policy
to
include
it
.

When
an
agreement
was
reached
to
strip
capital
gains
from
the
legislation
,
Oregon
Sen.
Bob
Packwood
,
the
ranking
GOP
member
of
the
tax-writing
Senate
Finance
Committee
,
hailed
it
.

Asked
if
the
administration
agreed
,
he
curtly
replied
:
``
The
adminstration
will
have
to
speak
for
itself
.

''
Friday
's
market
tumble
could
spur
action
on
reconciling
the
House
and
Senate
versions
of
the
deficit-reduction
measure
,
a
process
that
is
n't
expected
to
begin
until
tomorrow
at
the
soonest
.

Senate
Republicans
expressed
the
hope
that
the
House
would
follow
the
lead
of
the
Senate
,
which
on
Friday
agreed
to
drop
a
variety
of
spending
measures
and
tax
breaks
that
would
have
increased
the
fiscal
1990
deficit
.

``
The
market
needs
a
strong
signal
that
we
're
serious
about
deficit
reduction
,
and
the
best
way
to
do
that
is
for
the
House
of
Representatives
to
strip
their
bill
''
of
similar
provisions
,
Sen.
Warren
Rudman
(
R.
,
N.H
.

)
.

said
yesterday
.

The
White
House
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
,
whose
calculations
determine
whether
the
Gramm-Rudman
targets
are
met
,
estimated
that
the
House-passed
deficit-reduction
measure
would
cut
the
fiscal
1990
shortfall
by
$
6.2
billion
,
almost
half
of
the
Congressional
Budget
Office
's
estimate
of
$
11.0
billion
.

Rep.
Panetta
said
that
OMB
's
figure
would
still
be
enough
to
avoid
permanent
across-the-board
cuts
,
but
added
:
``
We
're
getting
very
close
to
the
margins
here
.

''
No
one
in
Washington
was
willing
to
take
the
blame
for
provoking
Friday
's
drop
in
the
stock
market
.

But
some
players
were
quick
to
seize
the
moment
.

Before
the
sun
had
set
on
Friday
,
Richard
Rahn
,
the
supply-side
chief
economist
of
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
issued
a
statement
attributing
the
drop
in
stock
prices
to
the
Senate
decision
to
postpone
action
on
capital
gains
.

``
Investors
,
who
had
been
holding
assets
in
anticipation
of
a
more
favorable
time
to
sell
,
were
spooked
,
''
he
said
.

``
There
have
been
many
preposterous
reasons
advanced
to
support
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
,
''
Sen.
Mitchell
said
during
his
television
appearance
,
``
but
I
suggest
that
is
perhaps
more
than
any
of
the
others
.

Small
investors
matched
their
big
institutional
brethren
in
anxiety
over
the
weekend
,
but
most
seemed
to
be
taking
a
philosophical
approach
and
said
they
were
resigned
to
riding
out
the
latest
storm
in
the
stock
market
.

``
I
'm
not
losing
faith
in
the
market
,
''
said
Boston
lawyer
Christopher
Sullivan
as
he
watched
the
market
plunge
on
a
big
screen
in
front
of
a
brokerage
firm
.

But
he
's
not
so
sure
about
everyone
else
.

``
I
think
on
Monday
the
small
(
investors
)
are
going
to
panic
and
sell
,
''
predicted
Mr.
Sullivan
,
whose
investments
include
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
unit
and
several
mutual
funds
.

``
And
I
think
institutions
are
going
to
come
in
and
buy
...
I
'm
going
to
hold
on
.

If
I
sell
now
,
I
'll
take
a
big
loss
.

''
Some
evinced
an
optimism
that
had
been
rewarded
when
they
did
n't
flee
the
market
in
1987
.

``
Oh
,
I
bet
it
'll
be
up
50
points
on
Monday
,
''
said
Lucy
Crump
,
a
78-year-old
retired
housewife
in
Lexington
,
Ky
.

Mrs.
Crump
said
her
Ashwood
Investment
Club
's
portfolio
lost
about
one-third
of
its
value
following
the
Black
Monday
crash
,
``
but
no
one
got
discouraged
,
and
we
gained
that
back
--
and
more
.

''
At
the
annual
congress
of
the
National
Association
of
Investors
Corp.
at
the
Hyatt
Regency
hotel
in
Minneapolis
,
the
scene
was
calm
.

Some
500
investors
representing
investor
clubs
from
around
the
U.S.
were
attending
when
the
market
started
to
slide
Friday
.

But
Robert
Showalter
,
an
official
of
the
association
,
said
no
special
bulletins
or
emergency
meetings
of
the
investors
'
clubs
are
planned
.

In
fact
,
some
of
the
association
's
members
--
long-term
,
buy-and-hold
investors
--
welcomed
the
drop
in
prices
.

``
We
hope
to
take
advantage
of
it
,
''
said
John
Snyder
,
a
member
of
a
Los
Angeles
investors
'
club
.

He
has
four
stocks
in
mind
to
buy
if
the
prices
drop
to
the
level
he
wants
.

Not
everyone
is
reacting
so
calmly
,
however
,
and
many
wonder
about
the
long-term
implications
of
what
is
widely
viewed
as
the
cause
of
Friday
's
slide
,
reluctance
by
banks
to
provide
financing
for
a
buy-out
of
UAL
Corp.
,
parent
of
United
Airlines
.

Marc
Perkins
,
a
Tampa
,
Fla.
,
investment
banker
,
said
the
market
drop
is
one
of
``
a
tremendous
number
of
signs
that
the
leveraged
take-out
era
is
ending
.

There
's
no
question
that
there
's
a
general
distaste
for
leverage
among
lenders
.

''
Mr.
Perkins
believes
,
however
,
that
the
market
could
be
stabilized
if
California
investor
Marvin
Davis
steps
back
in
to
the
United
bidding
with
an
offer
of
$
275
a
share
.

Sara
Albert
,
a
34-year-old
Dallas
law
student
,
says
she
's
generally
skittish
about
the
stock
market
and
the
takeover
activity
that
seems
to
fuel
it
.

``
I
have
this
feeling
that
it
's
built
on
sand
,
''
she
says
,
that
the
market
rises
``
but
there
's
no
foundation
to
it
.

''
She
and
her
husband
pulled
most
of
their
investments
out
of
the
market
after
the
1987
crash
,
although
she
still
owns
some
Texaco
stock
.

Partly
because
of
concern
about
the
economy
and
partly
because
she
recently
quit
her
job
as
a
legal
assistant
to
go
to
school
,
``
I
think
at
this
point
we
want
to
be
a
lot
more
liquid
.

''
Others
wonder
how
many
more
of
these
shocks
the
small
investor
can
stand
.

``
We
all
assumed
October
'87
was
a
one-time
shot
,
''
said
San
Francisco
attorney
David
Greenberg
.

``
We
told
the
little
guy
it
could
only
happen
once
in
a
lifetime
,
come
on
back
.

Now
it
's
happening
again
.

''
Mr.
Greenberg
got
out
just
before
the
1987
crash
and
,
to
his
regret
,
never
went
back
even
as
the
market
soared
.

This
time
he
's
ready
to
buy
in
``
when
the
panic
wears
off
.

''
Still
,
he
adds
:
``
We
ca
n't
have
this
kind
of
thing
happen
very
often
.

When
the
little
guy
gets
frightened
,
the
big
guys
hurt
badly
.

Merrill
Lynch
ca
n't
survive
without
the
little
guy
.

''
Small
investors
have
tiptoed
back
into
the
market
following
Black
Monday
,
but
mostly
through
mutual
funds
.

Discount
brokerage
customers
``
have
been
in
the
market
somewhat
but
not
whole
hog
like
they
were
two
years
ago
,
''
says
Leslie
Quick
Jr.
,
chairman
of
the
Quick
&
Reilly
discount
brokerage
firm
.

Hugo
Quackenbush
,
senior
vice
president
at
Charles
Scwhab
Corp.
,
says
Schwab
customers
``
have
been
neutral
to
cautious
recently
about
stocks
.

''
Individual
investors
are
still
angry
about
program
trading
,
Mr.
Quackenbush
says
.

Avner
Arbel
,
a
Cornell
University
finance
professor
,
says
government
regulators
will
have
to
more
closely
control
program
trading
to
``
win
back
the
confidence
of
the
small
investor
.

''
But
it
's
not
only
the
stock
market
that
has
some
small
investors
worried
.

Alan
Helfman
,
general
sales
manager
of
a
Chrysler
dealership
in
Houston
,
said
he
and
his
mother
have
some
joint
stock
investments
,
but
the
overall
economy
is
his
chief
worry
.

``
These
high
rollers
took
a
big
bath
today
,
''
he
said
in
his
showroom
,
which
is
within
a
few
miles
of
the
multi-million
dollar
homes
of
some
of
Houston
's
richest
citizens
.

``
And
I
can
tell
you
that
a
high
roller
is
n't
going
to
come
in
tomorrow
and
buy
a
Chrysler
TC
by
Maserati
.

''
And
,
finally
,
there
were
the
gloaters
.

``
I
got
out
in
1987
.

Everything
,
''
said
Pascal
Antori
,
an
Akron
,
Ohio
,
plumbing
contractor
who
was
visiting
Chicago
and
stopped
by
Fidelity
Investments
'
LaSalle
Street
office
.

``
I
just
stopped
by
to
see
how
much
I
would
have
lost
.

''
Would
Mr.
Antori
ever
get
back
in
?
``
Are
you
kidding
!
When
it
comes
to
money
:
Once
bitten
,
2,000
times
shy
.

''
The
crowded
field
for
notebook-sized
computers
is
about
to
become
a
lot
more
crowded
.

Compaq
Computer
Corp.
's
long-awaited
entry
today
into
the
notebook
field
is
expected
to
put
immediate
heat
on
others
in
the
market
,
especially
Zenith
Electronics
Corp.
,
the
current
market
leader
,
and
on
a
swarm
of
promising
start-ups
.

Compaq
's
series
of
notebooks
extends
a
trend
toward
downsizing
in
the
personal
computer
market
.

One
manufacturer
already
has
produced
a
clipboard-sized
computer
called
a
notepad
,
and
two
others
have
introduced
even
smaller
``
palmtops
.

''
But
those
machines
are
still
considered
novelties
,
with
keyboards
only
a
munchkin
could
love
and
screens
to
match
.

Compaq
's
notebooks
,
by
contrast
,
may
be
the
first
in
their
weight
class
not
to
skimp
on
features
found
in
much
bigger
machines
.

Analysts
say
they
're
faster
and
carry
more
memory
than
anything
else
of
their
size
on
the
market
--
and
they
're
priced
aggressively
at
$
2,400
to
$
5,000
.

All
of
this
comes
in
a
machine
that
weighs
only
six
pounds
and
fits
comfortably
into
most
briefcases
.

In
recent
months
,
Compaq
's
competition
,
including
Zenith
,
Toshiba
Corp.
,
Tandy
Corp.
and
NEC
Corp.
all
have
introduced
portables
that
weigh
approximately
the
same
and
that
are
called
notebooks
--
perhaps
misleadingly
.

One
analyst
,
noting
that
most
such
machines
are
about
two
inches
thick
,
takes
exception
to
the
name
.

``
This
is
n't
quite
a
notebook
--
I
call
it
a
phonebook
,
''
he
says
.

That
ca
n't
be
said
of
the
$
2,400
notepad
computer
introduced
a
few
weeks
ago
by
GRiD
Systems
Corp.
,
a
unit
of
Tandy
.

Instead
of
a
keyboard
,
it
features
a
writing
surface
,
an
electronic
pen
and
the
ability
to
``
read
''
block
printing
.

At
4
pounds
,
it
may
be
too
ambitiously
named
,
but
it
nevertheless
opens
up
the
kind
of
marketing
possibilities
that
make
analysts
froth
.

Palmtops
are
n't
far
behind
.

Atari
Corp.
's
Portfolio
,
introduced
in
Europe
two
months
ago
and
in
the
U.S.
in
early
September
,
weighs
less
than
a
pound
,
costs
a
mere
$
400
and
runs
on
three
AA
batteries
,
yet
has
the
power
to
run
some
spreadsheets
and
word
processing
programs
.

Some
critics
,
however
,
say
its
ability
to
run
commonplace
programs
is
restricted
by
a
limited
memory
.

Poquet
Computer
Corp.
,
meanwhile
,
has
introduced
a
much
more
sophisticated
palmtop
that
can
run
Lotus
1-2-3
and
other
sophisticated
software
programs
,
but
costs
five
times
as
much
.

At
stake
is
what
Mike
Swavely
,
Compaq
's
president
of
North
America
operations
,
calls
``
the
Holy
Grail
of
the
computer
industry
''
--
the
search
for
``
a
real
computer
in
a
package
so
small
you
can
take
it
everywhere
.

''
The
market
is
so
new
,
nobody
knows
yet
how
big
it
can
be
.

``
I
've
had
a
lot
of
people
trying
to
sell
me
services
to
find
out
how
big
it
is
,
''
says
Tom
Humphries
,
director
of
marketing
for
GRiD
.

``
Whether
it
's
$
5
billion
or
$
3.5
billion
,
it
does
n't
matter
.

It
's
huge
.

''
Consider
the
growth
of
portables
,
which
now
comprise
12
%
of
all
personal
computer
sales
.

Laptops
--
generally
anything
under
15
pounds
--
have
become
the
fastest-growing
personal
computer
segment
,
with
sales
doubling
this
year
.

Responding
to
that
demand
,
however
,
has
led
to
a
variety
of
compromises
.

Making
computers
smaller
often
means
sacrificing
memory
.

It
also
has
precluded
use
of
the
faster
,
more
powerful
microprocessors
found
in
increasing
numbers
of
desktop
machines
.

Size
and
weight
considerations
also
have
limited
screen
displays
.

The
competitive
sniping
can
get
pretty
petty
at
times
.

A
Poquet
spokesman
,
for
example
,
criticizes
the
Atari
Portfolio
because
it
requires
three
batteries
while
the
Poquet
needs
only
two
.

Both
palmtops
are
dismissed
by
notebook
makers
,
who
argue
that
they
're
too
small
--
a
problem
Poquet
also
encountered
in
focus
groups
,
admits
Gerry
Purdy
,
director
of
marketing
.

Poquet
,
trying
to
avoid
the
``
gadget
''
label
,
responded
with
the
tag
line
,
``
The
Poquet
PC
--
a
Very
Big
Computer
.

''
Despite
the
sniping
,
few
question
the
inevitability
of
the
move
to
small
machines
that
do
n't
make
compromises
.

Toward
that
end
,
experts
say
the
real
battle
will
take
place
between
center-stage
players
like
Toshiba
,
Zenith
and
now
Compaq
.

Compaq
's
new
machines
are
considered
a
direct
threat
to
start-up
firms
like
Dynabook
Inc.
,
which
introduced
in
June
a
computer
that
,
like
Compaq
's
,
uses
an
Intel
286
microprocessor
and
has
a
hard
disk
drive
.

But
the
Dynabook
product
is
twice
as
heavy
and
costs
more
than
Compaq
's
.

Compaq
's
announcement
also
spells
trouble
for
Zenith
,
which
last
year
had
28
%
of
the
U.S.
laptop
market
but
recently
agreed
to
sell
its
computer
business
to
Cie.
des
Machines
Bull
,
the
French
government-owned
computer
maker
.

Zenith
holders
will
vote
in
December
on
the
proposed
$
635
million
sale
,
a
price
that
could
slip
because
it
is
pegged
to
Zenith
's
share
and
sales
.

Compaq
is
already
taking
aim
at
Zenith
's
market
share
.

Rod
Canion
,
Compaq
's
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
notes
pointedly
that
Zenith
's
$
2,000
MinisPort
uses
an
``
unconventional
''
two-inch
floppy
disk
,
whereas
Compaq
's
new
machines
use
the
more
common
3
disk
.

John
P.
Frank
,
president
of
Zenith
Data
Systems
,
simply
shrugs
off
such
criticism
,
noting
that
3
floppies
were
also
``
unconventional
''
when
they
first
replaced
five-inch
disks
.

``
We
do
n't
look
at
it
as
not
being
a
standard
,
we
look
at
it
as
a
new
standard
,
''
he
argues
.

Analysts
do
n't
see
it
that
way
.

``
I
ca
n't
imagine
that
you
'll
talk
to
anyone
who
wo
n't
tell
you
this
is
dynamite
for
Compaq
and
a
stopper
for
everyone
else
,
''
says
Gene
Talsky
,
president
of
Professional
Marketing
Management
Inc
.

Adds
Bill
Lempesis
,
senior
industry
analyst
for
DataQuest
,
a
high-technology
market
research
firm
:
``
We
basically
think
that
these
are
very
hot
products
.

The
problem
Compaq
is
going
to
have
is
that
they
wo
n't
be
able
to
make
enough
of
them
.

''
Compaq
's
machines
include
the
3
floppy
disk
drive
,
a
backlit
screen
that
is
only
thick
and
an
internal
expansion
slot
for
a
modem
--
in
other
words
,
almost
all
the
capabilities
of
a
typical
office
machine
.

Others
undoubtedly
will
follow
,
but
most
analysts
believe
Compaq
has
at
least
a
six-month
lead
on
the
competition
.

Toshiba
's
line
of
portables
,
for
example
,
features
the
T-1000
,
which
is
in
the
same
weight
class
but
is
much
slower
and
has
less
memory
,
and
the
T-1600
,
which
also
uses
a
286
microprocessor
,
but
which
weighs
almost
twice
as
much
and
is
three
times
the
size
.

A
third
model
,
marketed
in
Japan
,
may
hit
the
U.S.
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
of
1990
,
but
by
then
,
analysts
say
,
Compaq
will
have
established
itself
as
one
of
three
major
players
.

What
about
Big
Blue
?
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
analysts
say
,
has
been
burned
twice
in
trying
to
enter
the
laptop
market
and
shows
no
signs
of
trying
to
get
into
notebooks
anytime
soon
.

Honeywell
Inc.
and
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
received
Air
Force
contracts
to
develop
integrated
circuits
for
use
in
space
.

Honeywell
's
contract
totaled
$
69.7
million
,
and
IBM
's
$
68.8
million
.

Boeing
Co.
received
a
$
46.7
million
Air
Force
contract
for
developing
cable
systems
for
the
Minuteman
Missile
.

General
Dynamics
Corp.
received
a
$
29
million
Air
Force
contract
for
electronic-warfare
training
sets
.

Grumman
Corp.
received
an
$
18.1
million
Navy
contract
to
upgrade
aircraft
electronics
.

Avco
Corp.
received
an
$
11.8
million
Army
contract
for
helicopter
engines
.

Sharp
increases
in
the
price
of
fresh
produce
caused
Spain
's
September
consumer
price
index
to
shoot
up
1.1
%
from
the
previous
month
,
pushing
the
annual
rate
of
inflation
to
6.8
%
,
the
National
Institute
of
Statistics
said
Friday
.

The
monthly
increase
is
the
highest
recorded
in
the
past
four
years
.

The
index
,
which
registered
156.8
at
the
end
of
September
,
has
a
base
of
100
set
in
1983
and
is
n't
seasonally
adjusted
.

Prices
have
risen
5.9
%
in
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
,
outstripping
both
the
initial
3
%
inflation
goal
set
by
the
government
of
Socialist
Prime
Minister
Felipe
Gonzalez
and
the
second
,
revised
goal
of
5.8
%
.

Japan
's
wholesale
prices
in
September
rose
3.3
%
from
a
year
earlier
and
were
up
0.4
%
from
the
previous
month
,
the
Bank
of
Japan
announced
Friday
.

The
wholesale
price
index
stood
at
90.1
,
compared
with
a
1985
base
of
100
.

Plunge
?
What
plunge
?
Twenty-four
New
York
Stock
Exchange
issues
hit
52-week
highs
during
Friday
's
trading
,
despite
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
's
190.58-point
plunge
.

Stocks
of
utilities
held
up
relatively
better
than
other
market
sectors
during
the
sell-off
.

And
among
the
issues
hitting
new
highs
were
Detroit
Edison
Co.
and
Niagara
Mohawk
Power
Corp
.

Other
major
issues
hitting
highs
included
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
,
Westinghouse
Electric
Corp.
,
Exxon
Corp.
and
Cigna
Corp.
,
the
big
insurer
.

Of
course
,
many
more
issues
--
93
--
hit
new
lows
.

These
included
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
which
during
Friday
's
session
traded
below
$
100
a
share
for
the
first
time
since
June
1984
.

IBM
closed
at
$
102
,
down
$
5.625
.

Other
new
lows
included
Navistar
International
Corp.
,
Union
Carbide
Corp.
and
Bethlehem
Steel
Corp.
,
all
of
which
are
included
in
the
industrial
average
.

Meanwhile
,
two
initial
public
offerings
braved
the
cascading
market
in
their
maiden
day
of
national
over-the-counter
trading
Friday
.

Shares
of
Rally
's
Inc.
,
an
operator
of
fast-food
restaurants
,
closed
at
$
17
each
,
up
from
its
$
15
offering
price
and
shares
of
Employee
Benefit
Plans
Inc.
,
a
health-care
consultant
,
closed
at
$
14.125
,
up
from
its
$
12
offering
price
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
said
it
acquired
5
%
of
the
shares
in
Jaguar
PLC
.

Jaguar
,
the
London
Stock
Exchange
and
the
U.S.
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
are
being
notified
of
the
transactions
,
the
company
said
.

The
U.S.
Federal
Trade
Commission
advised
Ford
last
week
that
it
would
n't
raise
any
objection
to
the
acquisition
of
as
much
as
15
%
of
Jaguar
shares
.

The
No.
2
auto
maker
disclosed
last
month
that
it
wants
to
buy
as
much
as
15
%
of
the
British
luxury-car
maker
,
the
maximum
allowed
under
current
United
Kingdom
government
restrictions
.

General
Motors
Corp.
said
it
had
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
joint
venture
with
Jaguar
before
Ford
began
buying
shares
.

GM
said
it
still
is
talking
with
Jaguar
about
acquiring
a
minority
interest
.

Investors
who
bought
stock
with
borrowed
money
--
that
is
,
``
on
margin
''
--
may
be
more
worried
than
most
following
Friday
's
market
drop
.

That
's
because
their
brokers
can
require
them
to
sell
some
shares
or
put
up
more
cash
to
enhance
the
collateral
backing
their
loans
.

In
October
1987
,
these
margin
calls
were
thought
to
have
contributed
to
the
downward
spiral
of
the
stock
market
.

Typically
,
a
margin
call
occurs
when
the
price
of
a
stock
falls
below
75
%
of
its
original
value
.

If
the
investor
does
n't
put
up
the
extra
cash
to
satisfy
the
call
,
the
brokerage
firm
may
begin
liquidating
the
securities
.

But
some
big
brokerage
firms
said
they
do
n't
expect
major
problems
as
a
result
of
margin
calls
.

Margin
calls
since
Friday
``
have
been
higher
than
usual
,
but
reasonable
,
''
a
spokesman
for
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
said
.

Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
officials
``
do
n't
expect
{
margin
calls
}
to
be
as
big
a
factor
as
in
1987
''
because
fewer
individual
investors
are
buying
stock
on
margin
,
a
spokesman
said
.

Hugo
Quackenbush
,
senior
vice
president
at
Charles
Schwab
Corp.
,
the
San
Francisco-based
discount
brokerage
firm
,
said
he
did
n't
expect
any
immediate
problems
with
margin
calls
for
Schwab
customers
.

He
said
Schwab
had
increased
margin
requirements
``
so
customers
have
more
of
a
cushion
.

''
He
added
:
``
We
learned
a
lesson
in
1987
about
volatility
.

Avis
Inc.
,
following
rival
Hertz
Corp.
's
lead
,
said
it
is
backing
out
of
frequent-flier
programs
with
three
airlines
.

The
Garden
City
,
N.Y.
,
car-rental
company
said
it
wo
n't
renew
contracts
with
NWA
Inc.
's
Northwest
Airlines
unit
,
Pan
Am
Corp.
's
Pan
American
World
Airways
unit
and
Midway
Airlines
at
the
end
of
this
year
.

But
it
remains
involved
in
programs
with
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
unit
and
Delta
Air
Lines
.

Industry
estimates
put
Avis
's
annual
cost
of
all
five
programs
at
between
$
8
million
and
$
14
million
.

A
spokesman
for
Avis
would
n't
specify
the
costs
but
said
the
three
airlines
being
dropped
account
for
``
far
less
than
half
''
of
the
total
.

Budget
Rent
a
Car
Corp.
,
of
Chicago
,
and
National
Car
Rental
Systems
Inc.
,
of
Minneapolis
,
both
said
they
had
no
plans
to
follow
suit
.

In
fact
,
Budget
indicated
it
saw
some
benefit
to
staying
involved
in
these
programs
,
in
which
renters
earn
frequent-flier
miles
and
fliers
can
get
car-rental
discounts
.

``
I
can
not
see
how
this
news
by
Hertz
and
Avis
can
not
benefit
Budget
's
programs
,
''
said
Bob
Wilson
,
Budget
's
vice
president
,
marketing
planning
.

Northwest
and
Midway
are
two
of
the
five
airlines
with
which
Budget
has
agreements
.

National
also
participates
in
the
Northwest
frequent-flier
program
along
with
four
other
airlines
,
including
Delta
and
USAir
Group
Inc.
's
USAir
unit
.

A
month
ago
,
Hertz
,
of
Park
Ridge
,
N.J.
,
said
that
it
would
drop
its
marketing
agreements
at
year
end
with
Delta
,
America
West
and
Texas
Air
Corp.
's
Continental
Airlines
and
Eastern
Airlines
,
and
that
pacts
with
American
Airlines
,
UAL
Inc
's
United
Airlines
and
USAir
also
would
be
ended
...
sometime
after
Dec.
31
.

At
the
time
,
Hertz
said
its
annual
fees
to
those
airlines
amounted
to
$
20
million
and
that
the
value
of
redeemed
awards
topped
$
15
million
.

Analysts
and
competitors
,
however
,
doubt
the
numbers
were
that
high
.

Budget
said
its
frequent-flier
costs
are
``
substantially
below
''
Avis
's
level
.

Robert
D.
Cardillo
,
Avis
vice
president
of
marketing
,
said
,
``
The
proliferation
and
costs
attached
to
{
frequent-flier
programs

have
significantly
diminished
their
value

''
This
year
has
been
difficult
for
both
Hertz
and
Avis
,
said
Charles
Finnie
,
car-rental
industry
analyst
at
Alex
.

Brown
&
Sons
.

``
They
've
been
looking
to
get
their
costs
down
,
and
this
is
a
fairly
sensible
way
to
do
it
,
''
he
said
.

CBS
Inc.
is
cutting
``
The
Pat
Sajak
Show
''
down
to
one
hour
from

CBS
insisted
the
move
was
n't
a

for
the
program
,
which
is
the
network
's
first
entry
into
the
late-night
talk

format
since

.

``
I
have
every

Tandem
Computers
Inc.
,
preparing
to
fight
with
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
for
a
piece
of
the
mainframe
business
,
said
it
expects
to
post
higher
revenue
and
earnings
for
its
fiscal
fourth
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
.

Tandem
said
it
expects
to
report
revenue
of
about
$
450
million
and
earnings
of
35
cents
to
40
cents
a
share
.

The
results
,
which
are
in
line
with
analysts
'
estimates
,
reflect
``
a
continued
improvement
in
our
U.S.
business
,
''
said
James
Treybig
,
Tandem
's
chief
executive
officer
.

In
the
year-earlier
period
,
Tandem
reported
net
income
of
$
30.1
million
,
or
31
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
383.9
million
.

Tandem
expects
to
report
the
full
results
for
the
quarter
next
week
.

Analysts
have
predicted
that
the
Cupertino
,
Calif.
,
company
will
report
revenue
of
$
430
million
to
$
460
million
and
earnings
of
35
cents
to
40
cents
a
share
.

Commenting
on
the
results
for
the
quarter
,
Mr.
Treybig
said
the
strength
of
the
company
's
domestic
business
came
as
``
a
surprise
''
to
him
,
noting
that
sales
``
in
every
region
of
the
U.S.
exceeded
our
plan
.

''
The
company
's
U.S.
performance
was
helped
by
``
a
record
quarter
for
new
customers
,
''
he
said
.

Tandem
makes
``
fault-tolerant
''
computers
--
machines
with
built-in
backup
systems
--
that
run
stock
exchanges
,
networks
of
automatic
tellers
and
other
complex
computer
systems
.

Tomorrow
the
company
is
scheduled
to
announce
its
most
powerful
computer
ever
,
which
for
the
first
time
will
bring
it
into
direct
competition
with
makers
of
mainframe
computers
.

Tandem
's
new
high-end
computer
is
called
Cyclone
.

Prices
for
the
machine
,
which
can
come
in
various
configurations
,
are
$
2
million
to
$
10
million
.

Analysts
expect
the
new
computer
to
wrest
a
hefty
slice
of
business
away
from
IBM
,
the
longtime
leader
in
mainframes
.

``
We
believe
they
could
siphon
perhaps
two
to
three
billion
dollars
from
IBM
''
over
the
next
few
years
,
said
George
Weiss
,
an
analyst
at
the
Gartner
group
.

That
will
spur
Tandem
's
growth
.

``
I
'd
be
disappointed
if
the
company
grew
by
less
than
20
%
next
year
,
''
said
John
Levinson
,
an
analyst
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

IBM
is
expected
to
respond
to
Tandem
's
Cyclone
by
discounting
its
own
mainframes
,
which
analysts
say
are
roughly
three
times
the
price
of
a
comparable
system
from
Tandem
.

``
Obviously
IBM
can
give
bigger
discounts
to
users
immediately
,
''
said
Mr.
Weiss
.

But
Mr.
Treybig
questions
whether
that
will
be
enough
to
stop
Tandem
's
first
mainframe
from
taking
on
some
of
the
functions
that
large
organizations
previously
sought
from
Big
Blue
's
machines
.

``
The
answer
is
n't
price
reductions
,
but
new
systems
,
''
he
said
.

Nevertheless
,
Tandem
faces
a
variety
of
challenges
,
the
biggest
being
that
customers
generally
view
the
company
's
computers
as
complementary
to
IBM
's
mainframes
.

Even
Mr.
Treybig
is
reluctant
to
abandon
this
notion
,
insisting
that
Tandem
's
new
machines
are
n't
replacements
for
IBM
's
mainframes
.

``
We
're
after
a
little
bigger
niche
,
''
he
said
.

Do
n't
jump
yet
.

The
stock
market
's
swoon
may
turn
out
to
be
good
news
for
the
economy
.

In
one
wild
hour
of
trading
,
the
market
managed
to
accomplish
what
the
Bush
administration
has
been
trying
to
do
,
unsuccessfully
,
for
weeks
.

It
is
forcing
the
Federal
Reserve
to
ease
its
grip
on
credit
and
it
took
the
wind
out
of
a
previously
irrepressible
dollar
.

The
resulting
decline
in
interest
rates
and
the
value
of
the
dollar
could
reinvigorate
American
business
--
indeed
,
the
entire
economy
.

This
may
sound
strangely
optimistic
.

After
all
,
until
a
few
years
ago
,
the
stock
market
was
viewed
as
a
barometer
of
the
national
economy
.

When
it
went
down
,
by
all
tradition
,
the
economy
followed
.

That
has
changed
,
partly
because
the
two
years
following
the
worst
stock-market
plunge
in
history
have
been
reasonably
comfortable
.

The
1987
crash
was
``
a
false
alarm
however
you
view
it
,
''
says
University
of
Chicago
economist
Victor
Zarnowitz
.

The
market
seems
increasingly
disconnected
from
the
rest
of
the
nation
.

Its
spasms
ca
n't
be
traced
to
fundamental
business
conditions
,
nor
do
they
appear
to
presage
major
shifts
in
the
economy
.

``
The
market
today
has
a
life
of
its
own
,
''
John
Akers
,
chairman
of
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
said
Saturday
.

``
There
's
nothing
rational
about
this
kind
of
action
.

''
Of
course
,
the
health
of
the
economy
will
be
threatened
if
the
market
continues
to
dive
this
week
.

Sharply
falling
stock
prices
do
reduce
consumer
wealth
,
damage
business
confidence
and
discourage
the
foreign
investors
upon
whom
the
U.S.
now
relies
for
financial
sustenance
.

The
financial-services
industry
was
battered
by
the
1987
crash
.

What
's
more
,
although
the
stock
market
is
far
less
overvalued
today
than
two
years
ago
,
the
U.S.
economy
is
weaker
.

Growth
is
slower
.

Profits
are
softer
.

Debt
burdens
are
heavier
.

But
if
the
stock
market
does
n't
continue
to
plummet
,
the
beneficial
effects
of
lower
interest
rates
and
a
lower
dollar
may
well
dominate
.

The
Fed
,
which
until
Friday
had
been
resisting
moves
to
ease
credit
,
is
now
poised
to
pour
money
into
the
economy
if
needed
to
soothe
the
markets
.

Fed
officials
may
protest
that
this
does
n't
necessarily
mean
a
fundamental
change
in
their
interest-rate
policies
.

But
the
experience
of
the
1987
crash
suggests
the
Fed
is
likely
to
bring
down
short-term
interest
rates
in
its
effort
to
calm
markets
.

Anticipating
the
Fed
's
move
,
money
traders
lowered
a
key
interest
rate
known
as
the
Federal
Funds
rate
to
8.625
%
late
Friday
,
down
from
8.820
%
the
day
before
.

Tiny
movements
in
the
rate
,
which
is
what
banks
charge
each
other
for
overnight
loans
,
are
usually
among
the
few
visible
tracks
that
the
Fed
leaves
on
the
monetary
markets
.

The
dollar
also
began
to
decline
Friday
as
the
stock
market
's
plunge
caused
some
investors
to
reassess
their
desire
to
invest
in
the
U.S
.

Treasury
officials
have
been
arguing
for
months
that
the
dollar
's
strength
was
out
of
whack
with
economic
fundamentals
,
threatening
to
extinguish
the
export
boom
that
has
sustained
manufacturers
for
several
years
.

The
market
drop
has
now
apparently
convinced
foreign
investors
that
the
Treasury
was
right
about
the
overpriced
dollar
.

A
modest
drop
in
the
dollar
--
only
a
modest
one
,
mind
you
--
would
be
welcomed
by
the
U.S
.

That
was
n't
the
case
in
1987
,
when
the
dollar
was
so
weak
that
some
economists
and
government
officials
seriously
worried
that
it
might
collapse
,
producing
panic
among
foreign
investors
and
diminishing
the
flow
of
foreign
capital
to
the
U.S
.

Another
big
difference
between
1987
and
1989
is
n't
so
comforting
.

In
the
third
quarter
of
1987
,
the
economy
spurted
at
an
inflation-adjusted
annual
rate
of
5.3
%
.

The
consensus
among
economists
is
that
it
grew
a
much
more
sluggish
2.3
%
in
the
third
quarter
of
1989
,
which
ended
two
weeks
ago
.

The
plunge
in
stock
prices
``
is
happening
at
a
time
when
the
economy
has
already
slowed
down
,
''
says
economist
Lawrence
Chimerine
of
WEFA
Group
,
a
Bala
Cynwyd
,
Pa.
,
forecasting
company
.

``
A
lot
of
pent-up
demand
is
gone
.

''
Consumer
spending
did
drop
in
the
months
following
Black
Monday
1987
--
``
but
only
slightly
and
for
a
short
period
of
time
,
''
recalls
Mr.
Zarnowitz
,
a
longtime
student
of
business
cycles
.

``
That
was
offset
by
strength
elsewhere
.

{
The
effects
}
were
much
less
severe
and
less
prolonged
than
some
had
feared
or
expected
.

''
Today
,
he
frets
,
exports
and
business
investment
spending
may
be
insufficient
to
pick
up
the
slack
if
stock
prices
sink
this
week
and
if
consumers
retrench
in
reaction
.

What
's
more
,
the
corporate
borrowing
binge
has
n't
abated
in
the
past
two
years
.

``
We
've
had
two
more
years
of
significant
accumulation
of
debt
...
just
at
the
time
when
earnings
are
being
squeezed
,
''
Mr.
Chimerine
notes
.

The
more
a
company
relies
on
borrowed
money
,
the
greater
its
sensitivity
to
an
economic
slowdown
.

A
company
with
a
strong
balance
sheet
can
withstand
an
unanticipated
storm
;
a
highly
leveraged
company
may
end
up
in
bankruptcy
court
.

The
Fed
,
of
course
,
knows
that
very
well
--
hence
its
readiness
to
pump
credit
into
the
economy
this
morning
.

But
,
in
the
process
,
the
Fed
risks
reigniting
inflation
.

Even
before
Friday
's
events
,
Harvard
University
economist
Benjamin
Friedman
was
arguing
that
the
Fed
wo
n't
be
able
to
live
up
to
its
tough
words
on
eliminating
inflation
because
of
its
responsibility
to
protect
fragile
financial
markets
,
banks
and
highly
leveraged
corporations
.

The
biggest
threat
on
the
economic
horizon
right
now
is
n't
recession
,
he
reasons
;
it
's
an
outbreak
of
uncontrolled
inflation
.

In
the
end
,
the
1987
collapse
suggested
,
the
economy
does
n't
move
in
lockstep
with
stock
prices
.

The
economy
does
,
however
,
depend
on
the
confidence
of
businesses
,
consumers
and
foreign
investors
.

A
panic
on
Wall
Street
does
n't
exactly
inspire
confidence
.

Surveys
suggested
that
consumer
confidence
was
high
before
Friday
.

A
190-point
drop
is
n't
likely
to
make
much
of
a
dent
;
multiply
that
a
few
times
over
,
though
,
and
it
will
.

If
the
reactions
of
executives
gathered
Saturday
at
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
for
the
Business
Council
meetings
are
typical
,
business
leaders
were
n't
overly
rattled
by
Friday
's
decline
.

And
if
foreign
investors
become
a
tad
more
cautious
--
well
,
the
dollar
's
recent
strength
suggests
that
the
U.S.
can
stand
it
.

On
the
bottom
line
,
the
most
comforting
fact
for
the
economic
outlook
is
that
we
've
been
through
this
before
.

Two
years
ago
,
about
the
only
point
of
comparison
was
the
1929
crash
and
the
subsequent
Depression
.

The
doomsayers
had
a
receptive
audience
.

The
prosperity
that
followed
Black
Monday
permits
a
more
optimistic
view
today
.

At
the
very
least
,
the
establishment
here
is
taking
comfort
from
the
nation
's
success
in
handling
the
last
go-around
.

As
Sen.
Lloyd
Bentsen
(
D.
,
Texas
)
observed
yesterday
,
``
The
Fed
avoided
a
meltdown
last
time
.

They
are
more
sophisticated
this
time
.

''
The
chemical
industry
is
expected
to
report
that
profits
eroded
in
the
third
quarter
because
of
skidding
prices
in
the
commodity
end
of
the
business
.

Producers
of
commodity
chemicals
,
the
basic
chemicals
produced
in
huge
volumes
for
other
manufacturers
,
have
seen
sharp
inventory
cutting
by
buyers
.

Once
the
chief
beneficiaries
of
the
industry
's
now
fading
boom
,
these
producers
also
will
be
reporting
against
exceptionally
strong
performances
in
the
1988
third
quarter
.

``
For
some
of
these
companies
,
this
will
be
the
first
quarter
with
year-to-year
negative
comparisons
,
''
says
Leonard
Bogner
,
a
chemical
industry
analyst
at
Prudential
Bache
Research
.

``
This
could
be
the
first
of
five
or
six
down
quarters
.

''
Perhaps
most
prominent
,
Dow
Chemical
Co.
,
which
as
of
midyear
had
racked
up
eight
consecutive
record
quarters
,
is
expected
to
report
that
profit
decreased
in
the
latest
quarter
from
a
year
earlier
,
if
only
by
a
shade
.

Though
Dow
has
aggressively
diversified
into
specialty
chemicals
and
pharmaceuticals
,
the
company
still
has
a
big
stake
in
polyethylene
,
which
is
used
in
packaging
and
housewares
.

Analysts
'
third-quarter
estimates
for
the
Midland
,
Mich.
,
company
are
between
$
3.20
a
share
and
$
3.30
a
share
,
compared
with
$
3.36
a
year
ago
,
when
profit
was
$
632
million
on
sales
of
$
4.15
billion
.

A
Dow
spokeswoman
declined
to
comment
on
the
estimates
.

At
the
investment
firm
of
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co.
,
the
commodity-chemical
segment
is
seen
pulling
down
overall
profit
for
20
companies
representative
of
the
whole
industry
by
8
%
to
10
%
.

``
You
will
find
the
commodities
off
more
than
the
others
and
the
diversified
companies
about
even
or
slightly
better
,
''
says
James
Wilbur
,
a
Smith
Barney
analyst
.

First
Boston
Corp.
projects
that
10
of
the
15
companies
it
follows
will
report
lower
profit
.

Most
of
the
10
have
big
commodity-chemical
operations
.

Still
,
some
industry
giants
are
expected
to
report
continuing
gains
,
largely
because
so
much
of
their
business
is
outside
commodity
chemicals
.

Du
Pont
Co.
is
thought
to
have
had
steady
profit
growth
in
white
pigments
,
fibers
and
polymers
.

Moreover
,
the
Wilmington
,
Del.
,
company
is
helped
when
prices
weaken
on
the
commodity
chemicals
it
buys
for
its
own
production
needs
,
such
as
ethylene
.

Analysts
are
divided
over
whether
Du
Pont
will
report
much
of
a
gain
in
the
latest
quarter
from
its
Conoco
Inc.
oil
company
.

The
estimates
for
Du
Pont
range
from
$
2.25
to
$
2.45
a
share
.

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
the
company
earned
$
461
million
,
or
$
1.91
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
7.99
billion
.

Du
Pont
declined
to
comment
.

Monsanto
Co.
,
too
,
is
expected
to
continue
reporting
higher
profit
,
even
though
its
sales
of
crop
chemicals
were
hurt
in
the
latest
quarter
by
drought
in
northern
Europe
and
the
western
U.S
.

The
St.
Louis-based
company
is
expected
to
report
again
that
losses
in
its
G.D.
Searle
&
Co.
pharmaceutical
business
are
narrowing
.

Searle
continued
to
operate
in
the
red
through
the
first
half
of
the
year
,
but
Monsanto
has
said
it
expects
Searle
to
post
a
profit
for
all
of
1989
.

Most
estimates
for
Monsanto
run
between
$
1.70
and
$
2
a
share
.

A
year
ago
,
the
company
posted
third-quarter
profit
of
$
116
million
,
or
$
1.67
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
2.02
billion
.

Monsanto
declined
to
comment
.

But
the
commodity-chemical
producers
are
caught
on
the
downside
of
a
pricing
cycle
.

By
some
accounts
on
Wall
Street
and
in
the
industry
,
the
inventory
reductions
are
near
an
end
,
which
may
presage
firmer
demand
.

But
doubters
say
growing
production
capacity
could
keep
pressure
on
prices
into
the
early
1990s
.

In
the
latest
quarter
,
at
least
,
profit
is
expected
to
fall
sharply
.

For
Himont
Inc.
,
``
how
far
down
it
is
,
we
do
n't
know
,
''
says
Leslie
Ravitz
at
Salomon
Brothers
.

The
projections
are
in
the
neighborhood
of
50
cents
a
share
to
75
cents
,
compared
with
a
restated
$
1.65
a
share
a
year
earlier
,
when
profit
was
$
107.8
million
on
sales
of
$
435.5
million
.

Himont
faces
lower
prices
for
its
mainstay
product
,
polypropylene
,
while
it
goes
forward
with
a
heavy
capital
investment
program
to
bolster
its
raw
material
supply
and
develop
new
uses
for
polypropylene
,
whose
markets
include
the
packaging
and
automobile
industries
.

The
company
,
based
in
Wilmington
,
Del.
,
is
81%-owned
by
Montedison
S.p
.

A.
,
Milan
,
which
has
an
offer
outstanding
for
the
Himont
shares
it
does
n't
already
own
.

At
Quantum
Chemical
Corp.
,
New
York
,
the
trouble
is
lower
prices
for
polyethylene
,
higher
debt
costs
and
the
idling
of
an
important
plant
due
to
an
explosion
.

Some
analysts
hedge
their
estimates
for
Quantum
,
because
it
is
n't
known
when
the
company
will
book
certain
one-time
charges
.

But
the
estimates
range
from
break-even
to
35
cents
a
share
.

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
Quantum
earned
$
99.8
million
,
or
$
3.92
a
share
,
on
sales
of
$
724.4
million
.

Another
big
polyethylene
producer
,
Union
Carbide
Corp.
,
is
expected
to
post
profit
of
between
$
1
a
share
and
$
1.25
,
compared
with
$
1.56
a
share
a
year
earlier
,
when
the
company
earned
$
213
million
on
sales
of
$
2.11
billion
.

Himont
,
Quantum
and

all
declined

The
economy
's
temperature
will
be
taken
from
several
vantage
points
this
week
,
with
readings
on
trade
,
output
,
housing
and
inflation
.

The
most
troublesome
report
may
be
the
August
merchandise
trade
deficit
due
out
tomorrow
.

The
trade
gap
is
expected
to
widen
to
about
$
9
billion
from
July
's
$
7.6
billion
,
according
to
a
survey
by
MMS
International
,
a
unit
of
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Thursday
's
report
on
the
September
consumer
price
index
is
expected
to
rise
,
although
not
as
sharply
as
the
0.9
%
gain
reported
Friday
in
the
producer
price
index
.

That
gain
was
being
cited
as
a
reason
the
stock
market
was
down
early
in
Friday
's
session
,
before
it
got
started
on
its
reckless
190-point
plunge
.

Economists
are
divided
as
to
how
much
manufacturing
strength
they
expect
to
see
in
September
reports
on
industrial
production
and
capacity
utilization
,
also
due
tomorrow
.

Meanwhile
,
September
housing
starts
,
due
Wednesday
,
are
thought
to
have
inched
upward
.

``
There
's
a
possibility
of
a
surprise
''
in
the
trade
report
,
said
Michael
Englund
,
director
of
research
at
MMS
.

A
widening
of
the
deficit
,
if
it
were
combined
with
a
stubbornly
strong
dollar
,
would
exacerbate
trade
problems
--
but
the
dollar
weakened
Friday
as
stocks
plummeted
.

In
any
event
,
Mr.
Englund
and
many
others
say
that
the
easy
gains
in
narrowing
the
trade
gap
have
already
been
made
.

``
Trade
is
definitely
going
to
be
more
politically
sensitive
over
the
next
six
or
seven
months
as
improvement
begins
to
slow
,
''
he
said
.

Exports
are
thought
to
have
risen
strongly
in
August
,
but
probably
not
enough
to
offset
the
jump
in
imports
,
economists
said
.

Views
on
manufacturing
strength
are
split
between
economists
who
read
September
's
low
level
of
factory
job
growth
as
a
sign
of
a
slowdown
and
those
who
use
the
somewhat
more
comforting
total
employment
figures
in
their
calculations
.

The
wide
range
of
estimates
for
the
industrial
output
number
underscores
the
differences
:
The
forecasts
run
from
a
drop
of
0.5
%
to
an
increase
of
0.4
%
,
according
to
MMS
.

A
rebound
in
energy
prices
,
which
helped
push
up
the
producer
price
index
,
is
expected
to
do
the
same
in
the
consumer
price
report
.

The
consensus
view
expects
a
0.4
%
increase
in
the
September
CPI
after
a
flat
reading
in
August
.

Robert
H.
Chandross
,
an
economist
for
Lloyd
's
Bank
in
New
York
,
is
among
those
expecting
a
more
moderate
gain
in
the
CPI
than
in
prices
at
the
producer
level
.

``
Auto
prices
had
a
big
effect
in
the
PPI
,
and
at
the
CPI
level
they
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
.

Food
prices
are
expected
to
be
unchanged
,
but
energy
costs
jumped
as
much
as
4
%
,
said
Gary
Ciminero
,
economist
at
Financial
Group
.

He
also
says
he
thinks
``
core
inflation
,
''
which
excludes
the
volatile
food
and
energy
prices
,
was
strong
last
month
.

He
expects
a
gain
of
as
much
as
0.5
%
in
core
inflation
after
a
summer
of
far
smaller
increases
.

Housing
starts
are
expected
to
quicken
a
bit
from
August
's
annual
pace
of
1,350,000
units
.

Economists
say
an
August
rebound
in
permits
for
multifamily
units
signaled
an
increase
in
September
starts
,
though
activity
remains
fairly
modest
by
historical
standards
.

Assuming
the
stock
market
does
n't
crash
again
and
completely
discredit
yuppies
and
trading
rooms
,
American
television
audiences
in
a
few
months
may
be
seeing
Britain
's
concept
of
both
.

``
Capital
City
''
is
a
weekly
series
that
premiered
here
three
weeks
ago
amid
unprecedented
hype
by
its
producer
,
Thames
Television
.

The
early
episodes
make
you
long
for
a
rerun
of
the
crash
of
1987
.

Let
's
make
that
1929
,
just
to
be
sure
.

According
to
the
program
's
publicity
prospectus
,
``
Capital
City
,
''
set
at
Shane
Longman
,
a
fictional
mid-sized
securities
firm
with
#
500
million
capital
,
``
follows
the
fortunes
of
a
close-knit
team
of
young
,
high-flying
dealers
,
hired
for
their
particular
blend
of
style
,
genius
and
energy
.

But
with
all
the
money
and
glamour
of
high
finance
come
the
relentless
pressures
to
do
well
;
pressure
to
pull
off
another
million
before
lunch
;
pressure
to
anticipate
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
...
''
You
need
n't
be
a
high-powered
securities
lawyer
to
realize
the
prospectus
is
guilty
of
less
than
full
disclosure
.

The
slickly
produced
series
has
been
criticized
by
London
's
financial
cognoscenti
as
inaccurate
in
detail
,
but
its
major
weakness
is
its
unrealistic
depiction
of
the
characters
'
professional
and
private
lives
.

Turned
loose
in
Shane
Longman
's
trading
room
,
the
yuppie
dealers
do
little
right
.

Judging
by
the
money
lost
and
mistakes
made
in
the
early
episodes
,
Shane
Longman
's
capital
should
be
just
about
exhausted
by
the
final
13th
week
.

In
the
opening
episode
we
learn
that
Michelle
,
a
junior
bond
trader
,
has
indeed
pulled
off
another
million
before
lunch
.

Trouble
is
,
she
has
lost
it
just
as
quickly
.

Rather
than
keep
the
loss
a
secret
from
the
outside
world
,
Michelle
blabs
about
it
to
a
sandwich
man
while
ordering
lunch
over
the
phone
.

Little
chance
that
Shane
Longman
is
going
to
recoup
today
.

Traders
spend
the
morning
frantically
selling
bonds
,
in
the
belief
that
the
U.S.
monthly
trade
figures
will
look
lousy
.

Ah
,
perfidious
Columbia
!
The
trade
figures
turn
out
well
,
and
all
those
recently
unloaded
bonds
spurt
in
price
.

So
much
for
anticipating
the
market
by
a
fraction
of
a
second
.

And
a
large
slice
of
the
first
episode
is
devoted
to
efforts
to
get
rid
of
some
nearly
worthless
Japanese
bonds
(
since
when
is
anything
Japanese
nearly
worthless
nowadays
?
)
.

Surprisingly
,
Shane
Longman
survives
the
week
,
only
to
have
a
senior
executive
innocently
bumble
his
way
into
becoming
the
target
of
a
criminal
insider
trading
investigation
.

Instead
of
closing
ranks
to
protect
the
firm
's
reputation
,
the
executive
's
internal
rivals
,
led
by
a
loutish
American
,
demand
his
resignation
.

The
plot
is
thwarted
when
the
firm
's
major
stockholder
,
kelp
farming
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
,
hurries
home
to
support
the
executive
.

But
the
investigation
continues
.

If
you
can
swallow
the
premise
that
the
rewards
for
such
ineptitude
are
six-figure
salaries
,
you
still
are
left
puzzled
,
because
few
of
the
yuppies
consume
very
conspicuously
.

In
fact
,
few
consume
much
of
anything
.

Two
share
a
house
almost
devoid
of
furniture
.

Michelle
lives
in
a
hotel
room
,
and
although
she
drives
a
canary-colored
Porsche
,
she
has
n't
time
to
clean
or
repair
it
;
the
beat-up
vehicle
can
be
started
only
with
a
huge
pair
of
pliers
because
the
ignition
key
has
broken
off
in
the
lock
.

And
it
takes
Declan
,
the
obligatory
ladies
'
man
of
the
cast
,
until
the
third
episode
to
get
past
first
base
with
any
of
his
prey
.

Perhaps
the
explanation
for
these
anomalies
is
that
class-conscious
Britain
is
n't
ready
to
come
to
terms
with
the
wealth
created
by
the
Thatcherian
free-enterprise
regime
.

After
all
,
this
is
n't
old
money
,
but
new
money
,
and
in
many
cases
,
young
money
.

This
attitude
is
clearly
illustrated
in
the
treatment
of
Max
,
the
trading
room
's
most
flamboyant
character
.

Yuppily
enough
,
he
lives
in
a
lavishly
furnished
converted
church
,
wears
designer
clothes
and
drives
an
antique
car
.

But
apparently
to
make
him
palatable
,
even
lovable
,
to
the
masses
,
the
script
inflates
pony-tailed
Max
into
an
eccentric
genius
,
master
of
11
Chinese
dialects
.

He
takes
his
wash
to
the
laundromat
,
where
he
meets
a
punky
French
girl
who
dupes
him
into
providing
a
home
for
her
pet
piranha
and
then
promptly
steals
his
car
and
dumps
it
in
Dieppe
.

In
producing
and
promoting
``
Capital
City
,
''
Thames
has
spent
about
as
much
as
Shane
Longman
loses
on
a
good
day
.

The
production
costs
are
a
not
inconsiderable
#
8
million
(
$
12.4
million
)
,
and
would
have
been
much
higher
had
not
the
cost
of
the
trading
floor
set
been
absorbed
in
the
budget
of
``
Dealers
,
''
an
earlier
made-for-TV
movie
.

Another
half
million
quid
went
for
a
volley
of
full-page
advertisements
in
six
major
British
newspapers
and
for
huge
posters
in
the
London
subway
.

These
expenses
create
a
special
incentive
for
``
Capital
City
's
''
producers
to
flog
it
,
or
a
Yank-oriented
version
of
it
,
in
America
.

Thames
's
U.S.
marketing
agent
,
Donald
Taffner
,
is
preparing
to
do
just
that
.

He
is
discreetly
hopeful
,
citing
three
U.S.
comedy
series
--
``
Three
's
Company
,
''
``
Too
Close
for
Comfort
''
and
``
Check
It
Out
''
--
that
had
British
antecedents
.

Perhaps
without
realizing
it
,
Mr.
Taffner
simultaneously
has
put
his
finger
on
the
problem
and
an
ideal
solution
:
``
Capital
City
''
should
have
been
a
comedy
,
a
worthy
sequel
to
the
screwball
British
``
Carry
On
''
movies
of
the
1960s
.

The
seeds
already
are
in
the
script
.

The
first
episode
concluded
with
a
marvelously
cute
scene
in
which
the
trading-room
crew
minded
a
baby
,
the
casualty
of
a
broken
marriage
at
the
firm
.

And
many
in
the
young
cast
bear
striking
resemblances
to
American
TV
and
movie
personalities
known
for
light
roles
.

Joanna
Kanska
looks
like
a
young
Zsa
Zsa
Gabor
;
William
Armstrong
,
who
plays
Max
,
could
pass
for
Hans
Conreid
,
and
Douglas
Hodge
(
Declan
)
for
James
Farentino
;
Rolf
Saxon
is
a
passable
Tommy
Noonan
and
Dorian
Healy
could
easily
double
for
Huntz
Hall
,
the
blank-faced
foil
of
the
Bowery
Boys
comedies
.

So
,
OK
kids
,
everybody
on
stage
for
``
Carry
On
Trading
''
:
The
cast
is
frantically
searching
the
office
for
misplaced
Japanese
bonds
that
suddenly
have
soared
in
value
because
Dai-Ichi
Kangyo
Bank
has
just
bought
the
White
House
.

The
pressure
is
too
much
for
Zsa
Zsa
,
who
slaps
a
security
guard
.

He
backflips
into
a
desktop
computer
terminal
,
which
explodes
,
covering
Huntz
Hall
's
face
with
microchips
.

And
all
the
while
,
the
bonds
are
in
the
baby
's
diaper
.

It
should
run
forever
.

Mr.
Rustin
is
senior
correspondent

the
Journal

London
bureau

Axa-Midi
Assurances
of
France
gave
details
of
its
financing
plans
for
its
proposed
$
4.5
billion
acquisition
of
Farmers
Group
Inc.
,
in
amended
filings
with
insurance
regulators
in
the
nine
U.S.
states
where
Farmers
operates
.

The
proposed
acquisition
is
part
of
Sir
James
Goldsmith
's
unfriendly
takeover
attempt
for
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
the
British
tobacco
,
retailing
,
paper
and
financial
services
concern
that
is
parent
of
Los
Angeles-based
Farmers
.

In
an
attempt
to
appease
U.S.
regulators
'
concern
over
a
Goldsmith
acquisition
of
Farmers
,
Sir
James
in
August
agreed
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
if
he
is
successful
in
acquiring
B.A.T
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
,
Axa
agreed
to
invest
$
1
billion
in
Hoylake
Investments
Ltd.
,
Sir
James
's
acquisition
vehicle
.

Of
the
total
$
5.5
billion
to
be
paid
to
Hoylake
by
Axa
,
about
$
1
billion
will
come
from
available
resources
of
Axa
's
parent
,
Axa-Midi
Group
,
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
the
form
of
notes
issued
by
Axa
,
and
the
remaining
$
2.25
billion
will
be
in
long-term
bank
loans
.

In
an
interview
Thursday
,
Claude
Bebear
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Axa
,
said
his
group
has
already
obtained
assurances
from
a
group
of
banks
led
by
Cie
.

Financiere
de
Paribas
that
they
can
provide
the
loan
portion
of
the
financing
.

The
other
banking
companies
in
the
group
are
Credit
Lyonnais
,
Societe
Generale
,
BankAmerica
Corp.
and
Citicorp
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Bebear
said
Axa-Midi
Group
has
``
more
than
$
2.5
billion
of
non-strategic
assets
that
we
can
and
will
sell
''
to
help
pay
off
debt
from
the
acquisition
.

He
said
the
assets
to
be
sold
would
be
``
non-insurance
''
assets
,
including
a
beer
company
and
a
real
estate
firm
,
and
would
n't
include
any
pieces
of
Farmers
.

``
We
wo
n't
put
any
burden
on
Farmers
,
''
he
said
.

The
amended
filings
also
point
out
that
under
a
new
agreement
,
Hoylake
has
an
absolute
obligation
to
sell
Farmers
to
Axa
upon
an
acquisition
of
B.A.T
.

``
We
hope
that
with
what
we
did
,
the
regulators
will
not
need
to
evaluate
Hoylake
,
and
they
can
directly
look
at
the
agreement
with
us
,
because
Hoylake
wo
n't
be
an
owner
of
Farmers
at
anytime
,
''
Mr.
Bebear
said
.

Any
change
of
control
in
Farmers
needs
approval
of
the
insurance
commissioners
in
the
nine
states
where
Farmers
and
its
related
companies
are
incorporated
.

The
amended
filings
were
required
because
of
the
new
agreement
between
Axa
and
Hoylake
,
and
to
reflect
the
extension
that
Sir
James
received
last
month
under
British
takeover
rules
to
complete
his
proposed
acquisition
.

Hoylake
dropped
its
initial
#
13.35
billion
(
$
20.71
billion
)
takeover
bid
after
it
received
the
extension
,
but
said
it
would
launch
a
new
bid
if
and
when
the
propsed
sale
of
Farmers
to
Axa
receives
regulatory
approval
.

A
spokesman
for
B.A.T
said
of
the
amended
filings
that
,
``
It
would
appear
that
nothing
substantive
has
changed
.

The
new
financing
structure
is
still
a
very-highly
leveraged
one
,
and
Axa
still
plans
to
take
out
75
%
of
Farmers
'
earnings
as
dividends
to
service
their
debt
.

''
That
dividend
is
almost
double
the
35
%
currently
taken
out
of
Farmers
by
B.A.T
,
the
spokesman
added
.

``
It
would
have
severe
implications
for
Farmers
'
policy
holders
.

''
To
fend
off
Sir
James
's
advances
,
B.A.T
has
proposed
a
sweeping
restructuring
that
would
pare
it
to
a
tobacco
and
financial
services
concern
.

Dismal
sales
at
General
Motors
Corp.
dragged
the
U.S.
car
and
truck
market
down
below
year-ago
levels
in
early
October
,
the
first
sales
period
of
the
1990
model
year
.

The
eight
major
domestic
auto
makers
sold
160,510
North
American-made
cars
in
the
first
10
days
of
October
,
a
12.6
%
drop
from
a
year
earlier
.

Domestically
built
truck
sales
were
down
10.4
%
to
86,555
pickups
,
vans
and
sport
utility
vehicles
.

The
heavy
use
of
incentives
to
clear
out
1989
models
appears
to
have
taken
the
steam
,
at
least
initially
,
out
of
1990
model
sales
,
which
began
officially
Oct.
1
.

This
appears
particularly
true
at
GM
,
which
had
strong
sales
in
August
and
September
but
saw
its
early
October
car
and
truck
results
fall
26.3
%
from
last
year
's
unusually
high
level
.

Overall
,
sales
of
all
domestic-made
vehicles
fell
11.9
%
from
a
year
ago
.

Without
GM
,
overall
sales
for
the
other
U.S.
automakers
were
roughly
flat
with
1989
results
.

Some
of
the
U.S.
auto
makers
have
already
adopted
incentives
on
many
1990
models
,
but
they
may
have
to
broaden
their
programs
to
keep
sales
up
.

``
We
've
created
a
condition
where
,
without
incentives
,
it
's
a
tough
market
,
''
said
Tom
Kelly
,
sales
manager
for
Bill
Wink
Chevrolet
in
Dearborn
,
Mich
.

Car
sales
fell
to
a
seasonally
adjusted
annual
selling
rate
of
5.8
million
vehicles
,
the
lowest
since
October
1987
.

The
poor
performance
contrasts
with
a
robust
selling
rate
of
almost
eight
million
last
month
.

Furthermore
,
dealers
contacted
late
last
week
said
they
could
n't
see
any
immediate
impact
on
sales
of
Friday
's
steep
market
decline
.

GM
's
domestic
car
sales
dropped
24.3
%
and
its
domestic
trucks
were
down
an
even
steeper
28.7
%
from
the
same
period
a
year
ago
.

All
of
the
GM
divisions
except
Cadillac
showed
big
declines
.

Cadillac
posted
a
3.2
%
increase
despite
new
competition
from
Lexus
,
the
fledging
luxury-car
division
of
Toyota
Motor
Corp
.

Lexus
sales
were
n't
available
;
the
cars
are
imported
and
Toyota
reports
their
sales
only
at
month-end
.

The
sales
drop
for
the
No.
1
car
maker
may
have
been
caused
in
part
by
the
end
in
September
of
dealer
incentives
that
GM
offered
in
addition
to
consumer
rebates
and
low-interest
financing
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

Last
year
,
GM
had
a
different
program
in
place
that
continued
rewarding
dealers
until
all
the
1989
models
had
been
sold
.

Aside
from
GM
,
other
car
makers
posted
generally
mixed
results
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
had
a
1.8
%
drop
in
domestic
car
sales
but
a
2.4
%
increase
in
domestic
truck
sales
.

Chrysler
Corp.
had
a
7.5
%
drop
in
car
sales
,
echoing
its
generally
slow
performance
all
year
.

However
,
sales
of
trucks
,
including
the
company
's
popular
minivans
,
rose
4.3
%
.

Honda
Motor
Co.
's
sales
of
domestically
built
vehicles
plunged
21.7
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

Honda
's
plant
in
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
was
gearing
up
to
build
1990
model
Accords
,
a
Honda
spokesman
said
.

``
We
're
really
confident
everything
will
bounce
back
to
normal
,
''
he
added
.

Separately
,
Chrysler
said
firm
prices
on
its
1990-model
domestic
cars
and
minivans
will
rise
an
average
of
5
%
over
comparably
equipped
1989
models
.

Firm
prices
were
generally
in
line
with
the
tentative
prices
announced
earlier
this
fall
.

At
that
time
,
Chrysler
said
base
prices
,
which
are
n't
adjusted
for
equipment
changes
,
would
rise
between
4
%
and
9
%
on
most
vehicle
.

Antonio
L.
Savoca
,
66
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
the
Atlantic
Research
Corp.
subsidiary
.

Mr.
Savoca
had
been
a
consultant
to
the
subsidiary
's
rocket-propulsion
operations
.

Mr.
Savoca
succeeds
William
H.
Borten
,
who
resigned
to
pursue
personal
interests
.

Sequa
makes
and
repairs
jet
engines
.

It
also
has
interests
in
military
electronics
and
electro-optics
,
marine
transportation
and
machinery
used
to
make
food
and
beverage
cans
.

It
was
n't
so
long
ago
that
a
radio
network
funded
by
the
U.S.
Congress
--
and
originally
by
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
--
was
accused
by
officials
here
of
employing
propagandists
,
imperialists
and
spies
.

Now
,
the
network
has
opened
a
news
bureau
in
the
Hungarian
capital
.

Employees
held
an
open
house
to
celebrate
and
even
hung
out
a
sign
:
``
Szabad
Europa
Radio
''
--
Radio
Free
Europe
.

``
I
think
this
is
a
victory
for
the
radio
,
''
says
Barnabas
de
Bueky
,
a
55-year-old
former
Hungarian
refugee
who
works
in
the
Munich
,
West
Germany
,
headquarters
as
deputy
director
of
the
Hungarian
service
.

In
fact
,
the
network
hopes
to
set
up
offices
in
Warsaw
and
anywhere
else
in
the
East
Bloc
that
will
have
it
.

But
the
rapid
changes
brought
on
by
glasnost
and
open
borders
are
altering
the
network
's
life
in
more
ways
than
one
.

In
fact
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
in
danger
of
suffering
from
its
success
.

While
the
network
currently
can
operate
freely
in
Budapest
,
so
can
others
.

In
addition
,
competition
for
listeners
is
getting
tougher
in
many
ways
than
when
broadcasting
here
was
strictly
controlled
.

Instead
of
being
denounced
as
an
evil
agent
of
imperialism
,
Radio
Free
Europe
is
more
likely
to
draw
the
criticism
that
its
programs
are
too
tame
,
even
boring
.

``
They
have
a
lot
to
do
these
days
to
compete
with
Hungarian
radio
,
''
says
Andrew
Deak
,
a
computer-science
student
at
the
Technical
University
in
Budapest
.

``
The
Hungarian
{
radio
}
reporters
seem
better
informed
and
more
critical
about
about
what
's
going
on
here
.

''
Indeed
,
Hungary
is
in
the
midst
of
a
media
explosion
.

Boys
on
busy
street
corners
peddle
newspapers
of
every
political
stripe
.

Newsstands
are
packed
with
a
colorful
array
of
magazines
.

Radio
and
television
are
getting
livelier
and
bolder
.

The
British
Broadcasting
Corp.
and
the
U.S.
State
Department
's
Voice
of
America
broadcast
over
Hungarian
airwaves
,
though
only
a
few
hours
a
day
each
in
Hungarian
.

Australian
press
magnate
Rupert
Murdoch
has
bought
50
%
stakes
in
two
popular
and
gossipy
Hungarian
newspapers
,
while
Britain
's
Robert
Maxwell
has
let
it
be
known
here
that
he
is
thinking
about
similar
moves
.

But
Radio
Free
Europe
does
n't
plan
to
fade
away
.

With
its
mission
for
free
speech
and
the
capitalist
way
,
the
network
's
staff
says
it
still
has
plenty
to
do
--
in
Hungary
and
in
the
``
Great
Eastern
Beyond
.

''
Radio
Free
Europe
and
its
sister
station
for
the
Soviet
Union
,
Radio
Liberty
,
say
they
wo
n't
cut
back
their
more
than
19
hours
of
daily
broadcasts
.

They
are
still
an
important
source
of
news
for
60
million
listeners
in
23
exotic
tongues
:
from
Bulgarian
and
Belorussian
to
Kazakh
and
Kirghiz
.

The
establishment
of
its
first
bureau
in
Warsaw
Pact
territory
shows
the
depth
of
some
of
the
changes
in
Eastern
Europe
.

Months
before
the
decision
by
the
Hungarian
Communist
Party
to
rename
itself
Socialist
and
try
to
look
more
appealing
to
voters
,
the
country
's
rulers
were
trying
to
look
more
hospitable
.

It
proved
a
perfect
time
for
Radio
Free
Europe
to
ask
for
permission
to
set
up
office
.

Not
only
did
the
Hungarian
Ministry
of
Foreign
Affairs
approve
Radio
Free
Europe
's
new
location
,
but
the
Ministry
of
Telecommunications
did
something
even
more
amazing
:
``
They
found
us
four
phone
lines
in
central
Budapest
,
''
says
Geza
Szocs
,
a
Radio
Free
Europe
correspondent
who
helped
organize
the
Budapest
location
.

``
That
is
a
miracle
.

''
It
's
a
far
cry
from
the
previous
treatment
of
the
network
,
which
had
to
overcome
jamming
of
its
frequencies
and
intimidation
of
local
correspondents
(
who
filed
reports
to
the
network
by
phone
,
secret
messengers
or
letters
)
.

In
fact
,
some
of
the
network
's
Hungarian
listeners
say
they
owe
Radio
Free
Europe
loyalty
because
it
was
responsible
in
many
ways
for
keeping
hope
alive
through
what
one
writer
here
calls
the
``
Dark
Ages
of
the
20th
Century
.

''
``
During
the
past
four
years
,
many
of
us
have
sat
up
until
late
at
night
listening
to
our
radios
,
''
says
the
writer
.

``
There
were
some
very
brave
broadcasts
.

''
The
listeners
,
too
,
had
to
be
brave
.

Through
much
of
the
post-World
War
II
period
,
listening
to
Western
broadcasts
was
a
crime
in
Hungary
.

``
When
we
listen
to
the
Europe
station
,
my
mother
still
gets
nervous
,
''
says
a
Budapest
translator
.

``
She
wants
to
turn
down
the
volume
and
close
the
curtains
.

''
Now
,
the
toughest
competition
for
Radio
Free
Europe
comes
during
the
late-night
slot
.

Hungarian
radio
often
saves
its
most
politically
outspoken
broadcasts
for
around
midnight
.

Television
,
which
most
of
the
time
is
considered
rather
tame
,
has
entered
the
running
with
a
new
program
,
``
The
End
of
the
Day
,
''
which
comes
on
after
11
p.m
.

It
is
a
talk
show
with
opposition
leaders
and
political
experts
who
discuss
Hungary
's
domestic
problems
as
well
as
foreign
affairs
.

Those
who
want
to
hear
even
more
radical
views
have
to
get
up
at
five
on
Sunday
morning
for
``
Sunday
Journal
,
''
on
Hungarian
Radio
.

The
competitive
spirit
is
clearly
influencing
Radio
Free
Europe
,
which
is
trying
to
beef

The
Budapest
office
plans
to
hire
free-lance
reporters
to
cover
the
latest
happenings
in
Hungarian
country
towns
from
Nagykanizsa
in
the
west
to
Nyiregyhaza
in
the
east
.

The
Hungarian
service
has
a
daily
40-minute
news
show
called
Newsreel
,
with
international
and
domestic
news
,
plus
a
daily
news
review
of
opinions
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
also
a
host
of
new
programs
,
trying
to
lighten
up
on
the
traditional
diet
of
politics
.

A
daily
35-minute
program
called
``
The
March
of
Time
''
tries
to
find
interesting
tidbits
of
lighthearted
news
and
gossip
from
around
the
world
.

There
's
a
program
for
women
and
a
science
show
.

And
to
attract
younger
listeners
,
Radio
Free
Europe
intersperses
the
latest
in
Western
rock
groups

``
We
are
starving
for
all
the
news
,
''
says
Mr.
Deak
,
the
student
.

``
Every
moment
we
want
to
know
everything
about
the
world
.

''
Proposals
for
government-operated
``
national
service
,
''
like
influenza
,
flare
up
from
time
to
time
,
depress
the
resistance
of
the
body
politic
,
run
their
course
,
and
seem
to
disappear
,
only
to
mutate
and
afflict
public
life
anew
.

The
disease
metaphor
comes
to
mind
,
of
course
,
not
as
an
aspersion
on
the
advocates
of
national
service
.

Rather
,
it
is
born
of
frustration
with
having
to
combat
constantly
changing
strains
of
a
statist
idea
that
one
thought
had
been
eliminated
in
the
early
1970s
,
along
with
smallpox
.

It
is
back
with
us
again
,
in
the
form
of
legislation
to
pay
volunteers
under
a
``
National
and
Community
Service
Act
,
''
a
proposal
with
a
serious
shot
at
congressional
passage
this
fall
.

Why
does
the
national-service
virus
keep
coming
back
?
Perhaps
it
is
because
utopian
nostalgia
evokes
both
military
experience
and
the
social
gospel
.

If
only
we
could
get
America
's
wastrel
youth
into
at
least
a
psychic
uniform
we
might
be
able
to
teach
self-discipline
again
and
revive
the
spirit
of
giving
.

A
quarter
of
a
century
ago
national
service
was
promoted
as
a
way
of
curing
the
manifest
inequities
of
the
draft
--
by
,
of
all
things
,
expanding
the
draft
.

Those
of
us
who
resisted
the
idea
then
suspect
today
that
an
obligation
of
government
service
for
all
young
people
is
still
the
true
long-term
aim
of
many
national-service
backers
,
despite
their
protests
that
present
plans
contain
no
coercion
.

Choice
of
the
volunteer
military
in
the
1970s
seemed
to
doom
national
service
as
much
as
the
draft
.

But
the
virus
was
kept
alive
in
sociology
departments
until
a
couple
of
years
ago
,
when
it
again
was
let
loose
.

This
time
it
attempted
to
invade
two
connected
problems
,
the
rising
cost
of
higher
education
and
the
rising
expense
to
the
federal
government
of
educational
grants
and
loans
.

Why
not
keep
and
even
expand
the
loans
and
grants
,
the
advocates
reasoned
,
but
require
some
form
of
service
from
each
recipient
?
Military
service
,
moreover
,
could
be
a
national-service
option
.

Thus
,
undoubtedly
it
was
hoped
that
the
new
strain
of
national
service
would
prove
contagious
,
infecting
patriotic
conservatives
,
pay-as-you-go
moderates
,
and
idealistic
liberals
.

The
Democratic
Leadership
Council
,
a
centrist
group
sponsoring
the
plan
,
surely
thought
it
might
help
the
party
to
attract
support
,
especially
among
college
students
and
their
parents
.

A
provision
allowing
grants
to
be
applied
to
first-home
purchases
was
added
to
appeal
to
those
who
had
had
enough
of
schooling
.

The
DLC
plan
envisaged
``
volunteers
''
planting
trees
,
emptying
bedpans
,
tutoring
children
,
and
assisting
librarians
for
$
100
a
week
,
tax
free
,
plus
medical
care
.

With
a
tax-free
$
10,000
voucher
payment
at
the
end
of
each
year
,
the
volunteers
would
be
making
a
wage
comparable
to
$
17,500
a
year
.

Mind
you
,
most
of
``
the
volunteers
''
would
be
unskilled
17
-
to
18-year-olds
,
some
not
even
high
school
graduates
,
and
many
saving
money
by
living
at
home
.

They
would
be
doing
better
financially
under
national
service
than
many
taxpayers
working
at
the
same
kinds
of
jobs
and
perhaps
supporting
families
.

As
it
happened
,
political
resistance
developed
among
educational
and
minority
interests
that
count
on
the
present
education
grant
system
,
so
the
national-service
devotees
decided
to
abandon
the
supposedly
crucial
principle
of
``
give
in
order
to
get
.

''
Opposition
to
national
service
from
the
Pentagon
,
which
wants
to
protect
its
own
recruitment
process
,
also
led
to
the
military-service
option
being
dropped
.

Clearly
,
a
new
rationale
for
national
service
had
to
be
cooked
up
.

What
better
place
to
turn
than
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
's
Labor
Committee
,
that
great
stove
of
government
expansionism
,
where
many
a
stagnant
pot
of
porridge
is
kept
on
the
back
burner
until
it
can
be
brought
forward
and
presented
as
nouvelle
cuisine
?
In
this
case
,
the
new
recipe
for
national
service
called
for
throwing
many
assorted
legislative
leftovers
into
one
kettle
:
a
demonstration
project
for
educational
aid
(
particularly
satisfying
to
the
DLC
and
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
)
,
a
similar
demonstration
program
for
youth
conservation
(
a
la
Sen.
Chris
Dodd
)
,
a
competitive
grants
program
to
states
to
spark
youth
and
senior
citizen
volunteer
projects
(
a
Kennedy
specialty
)
,
a
community
service
work-study
program
for
students
(
pleasing
to
the
palate
of
Sen.
Dale
Bumpers
,
among
others
)
,
plus
engorgement
of
the
VISTA
volunteer
program
and
the
Retired
Senior
Volunteer
,
Foster
Grandparent
,
and
Senior
Companion
programs
.

Before
the
menu
is
printed
,
the
House
may
add
more
ingredients
,
also
changing
the
initial
price
,
now
posted
at
some
$
330
million
.

It
is
widely
known
that
``
too
many
cooks
spoil
the
broth
,
''
but
that
wisdom
does
not
necessarily
reflect
the
view
of
the
cooks
,
especially
if
they
are
senators
.

The
``
omnibus
''
bill
coming
out
of
Congress
may
be
unwholesome
glop
,
but
the
assorted
chefs
are
happy
and
the
restaurant
is
pushing
the
dish
very
hard
.

The
aroma
of
patronage
is
in
the
air
.

Is
the
voluntary
sector
so
weak
that
it
needs
such
unsolicited
assistance
?
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
as
robust
as
ever
.

According
to
the
Gallup
Poll
,
American
adults
contribute
an
average
of
two
hours
a
week
of
service
,
while
financial
contributions
to
charity
in
the
1980s
have
risen
30
%
(
adjusted
for
inflation
)
.

Even
if
government
does
see
various
``
unmet
needs
,
''
national
service
is
not
the
way
to
meet
them
.

If
we
want
to
support
students
,
we
might
adopt
the
idea
used
in
other
countries
of
offering
more
scholarships
based
on
something
called
``
scholarship
,
''
rather
than
on
the
government
's
idea
of
``
service
.

''
Or
we
might
provide
a
tax
credit
for
working
students
.

What
we
do
not
need
to
do
is
start
a
war
,
and
then
try
to
justify
it
by
creating
a
GI
Bill
.

To
the
extent
we
lack
manpower
to
staff
menial
jobs
in
hospitals
,
for
example
,
we
should
raise
pay
,
pursue
labor-saving
technology
,
or
allow
more
legal
immigration
,
rather
than
overpay
high
school
graduates
as
short-term
workers
and
cause
resentment
among
permanent
workers
paid
lesser
amounts
to
do
the
same
jobs
.

Will
national
service
,
in
the
current
highly
politicized
and
opportunistic
form
exert
enough
appeal
to
get
adopted
?
Not
necessarily
.

Polls
show
wide
,
generalized
support
for
some
vague
concept
of
service
,
but
the
bill
now
under
discussion
lacks
any
passionate
public
backing
.

Nonetheless
,
Senate
Democrats
are
organizing
a
roll
of
supporting
``
associations
,
''
``
societies
''
and
``
councils
,
''
some
of
which
may
hope
to
receive
the
paid
``
volunteers
.

''
So
far
,
the
president
seems
ill-disposed
to
substitute
any
of
the
omnibus
for
his
own
free-standing
proposal
to
endow
a
``
Points
of
Light
''
foundation
with
$
25
million
to
inform
citizens
of
all
ages
and
exhort
them
to
genuine
volunteerism
.

However
,
even
this
admirable
plan
could
become
objectionable
if
the
White
House
gives
in
to
congressional
Democratic
pressure
to
add
to
the
scope
of
the
president
's
initiative
or
to
involve
the
independent
foundation
in
``
brokering
''
federal
funds
for
volunteer
projects
.

There
's
no
need
for
such
concessions
.

The
omnibus
can
be
defeated
,
the
virus
controlled
,
and
real
service
protected
.

National
service
,
the
utopian
idea
,
still
wo
n't
go
away
then
,
of
course
,
but
the
millions
of
knee-socked
youth
performing
works
of
``
civic
content
''
will
be
mobilized
only
in
the
imagination
of
their
progenitors
.

American

purchased
about
42
%
of
Prime
Medical
Services

about
$
5
million
from
Texas
American
Energy
Corp

American
Physicians
said
it
also
replaced
four
Texas
American
representatives
on
Prime
's
five-member
board

American
provides
a
variety
of
financial

Prime
,
based

provides
management
services

For

The
inflation-adjusted
growth
rate
for
France
's

revised
upward

0.8
%
from
the
previous
three
months
from
the
initial
estimate
of
0.7
%
,
the

the
latest
revision
left
the
growth
rate

.

If
the
economy
continues
to
expand
by
0.8

a
quarter

,
it
would
leave

The
debate
over
National
Service
has
begun
again
.

After
a
decade
in
which
more
than
50
localities
established
their
own
service
or
conservation
corps
and
dozens
of
school
systems
made
community
service
a
prerequisite
to
high-school
graduation
,
the
focus
has
shifted
to
Washington
.

At
least
10
bills
proposing
one
or
another
national
program
were
introduced
in
Congress
this
spring
.

One
,
co-sponsored
by
Sen.
Sam
Nunn
(
D.
,
Ga
.

)
and
Rep.
Dave
McCurdy
(
D.
,
Okla.
)
,
would
have
restricted
federal
college
subsidies
to
students
who
had
served
.

An
omnibus
bill
assembled
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass.
)
,
and
including
some
diluted
Nunn-McCurdy
provisions
along
with
proposals
by
fellow
Democratic
Sens.
Claiborne
Pell
,
Barbara
Mikulski
and
Christopher
Dodd
,
has
been
reported
out
of
the
Senate
Labor
Committee
.

It
might
well
win
Senate
passage
.

President
Bush
has
outlined
his
own
Youth
Entering
Service
(
YES
)
plan
,
though
its
details
remain
to
be
specified
.

What
is
one
to
think
of
all
this
?
Doctrine
and
special
interests
govern
some
responses
.

People
eager
to
have
youth
``
pay
their
dues
to
society
''
favor
service
proposals
--
preferably
mandatory
ones
.

So
do
those
who
seek
a
``
re-energized
concept
of
citizenship
,
''
a
concept
imposing
stern
obligations
as
well
as
conferring
rights
.

Then
there
are
instinctive
opponents
.

To
libertarians
,
mandatory
service
is
an
abomination
and
voluntary
systems
are
illegitimate
uses
of
tax
money
.

Devotees
of
the
market
question
the
value
of
the
work
national
service
would
perform
:
If
the
market
wo
n't
pay
for
it
,
they
argue
,
it
ca
n't
be
worth
its
cost
.

Elements
of
the
left
are
also
reflexively
opposed
;
they
see
service
as
a
cover
for
the
draft
,
or
fear
the
regimentation
of
youth
,
or
want
to
see
rights
enlarged
,
not
obligations
.

But
what
about
those
of
us
whose
views
are
not
predetermined
by
formula
or
ideology
?
How
should
we
think
about
national
service
?
Let
's
begin
by
recognizing
a
main
source
of
confusion
--
``
national
service
''
has
no
agreed
meaning
.

Would
service
be
voluntary
or
compulsory
?
Short
or
long
?
Part-time
or
full-time
?
Paid
or
unpaid
?
Would
participants
live
at
home
and
work
nearby
or
live
in
barracks
and
work
on
public
lands
?
What
kinds
of
work
would
they
do
?
What
does
``
national
''
mean
?
Would
the
program
be
run
by
the
federal
government
,
by
local
governments
,
or
by
private
voluntary
organizations
?
And
who
would
serve
?
Only
males
,
as
with
the
draft
,
or
both
sexes
?
Youth
only
or
all
ages
?
Middle-class
people
,
or
poor
people
,
or
a
genuine
cross-section
?
Many
or
few
?
Those
are
not
trivial
questions
,
and
the
label
``
national
service
''
answers
none
of
them
.

Then
how
should
we
think
about
national
service
?
As
a
starting
point
,
here
are
five
propositions
:
1
.

Consider
the
ingredients
,
not
the
name
.

Ignore
``
national
service
''
in
the
abstract
;
consider
specific
proposals
.

They
will
differ
in
crucial
ways
.

2
.

``
Service
''
should
be
service
.

As
commonly
understood
,
service
implies
sacrifice
.

It
involves
accepting
risk
,
or
giving
up
income
,
or
deferring
a
career
.

It
follows
that
proposals
like
Nunn-McCurdy
,
whose
benefits
to
enrollees
are
worth
some
$
17,500
a
year
,
do
not
qualify
.

There
is
a
rationale
for
such
bills
:
Federal
subsidies
to
college
students
amount
to
``
a
GI
Bill
without
the
GI
''
;
arguably
those
benefits
should
be
earned
,
not
given
.

But
the
earnings
exceed
by
20
%
the
average
income
of
young
high-school
graduates
with
full-time
jobs
.

Why
call
that
service
?
3
.

Encouragement
is
fine
;
compulsion
is
not
.

Compelled
service
is
unconstitutional
.

It
is
also
unwise
and
unenforceable
.

(
Who
will
throw
several
hundred
thousand
refusers
in
jail
each
year
?
)
But
through
tax
policy
and
in
other
ways
the
federal
government
encourages
many
kinds
of
behavior
.

It
should
also
encourage
service
--
preferably
by
all
classes
and
all
ages
.

Its
encouragement
should
strengthen
and
not
undercut
the
strong
tradition
of
volunteering
in
the
U.S.
,
should
build
on
the
service
programs
already
in
existence
,
and
should
honor
local
convictions
about
which
tasks
most
need
doing
.

.

Good
programs
are
not
cheap
.

Enthusiasts
assume
that
national
service
would
get
important
work
done
cheaply
:
forest
fires
fought
,
housing
rehabilitated
,
students
tutored
,
day-care
centers
staffed
.

There
is
important
work
to
be
done
,
and
existing
service
and
conservation
corps
have
shown
that
even
youths
who
start
with
few
skills
can
do
much
of
it
well
--
but
not
cheaply
.

Good
service
programs
require
recruitment
,
screening
,
training
and
supervision
--
all
of
high
quality
.

They
involve
stipends
to
participants
.

Full-time
residential
programs
also
require
housing
and
full-time
supervision
;
they
are
particularly
expensive
--
more
per
participant
than
a
year
at
Stanford
or
Yale
.

Non-residential
programs
are
cheaper
,
but
good
ones
still
come
to
some
$
10,000
a
year
.

Are
they
worth
that
?
Evaluations
suggest
that
good
ones
are
--
especially
so
if
the
effects
on
participants
are
counted
.

But
the
calculations
are
challengeable
.

5
.

Underclass
youth
are
a
special
concern
.

Are
such
expenditures
worthwhile
,
then
?
Yes
,
if
targeted
.

People
of
all
ages
and
all
classes
should
be
encouraged
to
serve
,
but
there
are
many
ways
for
middle-class
kids
,
and
their
elders
,
to
serve
at
little
public
cost
.

They
can
volunteer
at
any
of
thousands
of
non-profit
institutions
,
or
participate
in
service
programs
required
by
high
schools
or
encouraged
by
colleges
or
employers
.

Underclass
youth
do
n't
have
those
opportunities
.

They
are
not
enrolled
in
high
school
or
college
.

They
are
unlikely
to
be
employed
.

And
they
have
grown
up
in
unprecedentedly
grim
circumstances
,
among
family
structures
breaking
down
,
surrounded
by
self-destructive
behaviors
and
bleak
prospects
.

But
many
of
them
can
be
quite
profoundly
reoriented
by
productive
and
disciplined
service
.

Some
wo
n't
accept
the
discipline
;
others
drop
out
for
other
reasons
.

But
some
whom
nothing
else
is
reaching
are
transformed
.

Learning
skills
,
producing
something
cooperatively
,
feeling
useful
,
they
are
no
longer
dependent
--
others
now
depend
on
them
.

Even
if
it
is
cheaper
to
build
playgrounds
or
paint
apartments
or
plant
dune-grass
with
paid
professionals
,
the
effects
on
the
young
people
providing
those
services
alter
the
calculation
.

Strictly
speaking
,
these
youth
are
not
performing
service
.

They
are
giving
up
no
income
,
deferring
no
careers
,
incurring
no
risk
.

But
they
believe
themselves
to
be
serving
,
and
they
begin
to
respect
themselves
(
and
others
)
,
to
take
control
of
their
lives
,
to
think
of
the
future
.

That
is
a
service
to
the
nation
.

It
is
what
federal
support
should
try
hardest
to
achieve
.

Mr.
Szanton

a
Carter
administration
budget
official

Washington-based

planning
firm

It

Oct.

)
Government
officials
here
and
in
other
countries
laid
plans
through
the
weekend
to
head
off
a
Monday
market
meltdown
--
but
went
out
of
their
way
to
keep
their
moves
quiet
.

Federal
Reserve
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
was
on
the
telephones
,
making
it
clear
to
officials
in
the
U.S.
and
abroad
that
the
Fed
was
prepared
to
inject
massive
amounts
of
money
into
the
banking
system
,
as
it
did
in
October
1987
,
if
the
action
were
needed
to
prevent
a
financial
crisis
.

And
at
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
talked
with
friends
and
associates
on
Wall
Street
while
Assistant
Secretary
David
Mullins
carefully
analyzed
data
on
the
Friday
market
plunge
.

But
the
officials
feared
that
any
public
announcements
would
only
increase
market
jitters
.

In
addition
,
officials
at
the
Fed
and
in
the
Bush
administration
decided
that
avoiding
overt
actions
and
statements
over
the
weekend
would
give
them
more
strength
and
flexibility
should
Friday
's
market
drop
turn
into
this
morning
's
rout
.

``
The
disadvantage
at
this
point
is
that
anything
you
do
that
looks
like
you
are
doing
too
much
tends
to
reinforce
a
sense
of
crisis
,
''
said
one
government
official
,
insisting
on
anonymity
.

The
Fed
's
efforts
at
secrecy
were
partly
foiled
Sunday
morning
,
when
both
the
New
York
Times
and
the
Washington
Post
carried
stories
quoting
a
senior
Fed
official
saying
the
central
bank
was
prepared
to
pour
cash
into
the
banking
system
Monday
morning
.

Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
was
surprised
by
both
stories
,
according
to
knowledgeable
sources
,
and
insisted
he
had
n't
authorized
any
public
comment
.

Nevertheless
,
Fed
officials
acknowledged
the
stories
were
reasonably
accurate
portrayals
of
the
central
bank
's
game
plan
.

It
is
prepared
to
assume
the
same
role
it
played
in
October
1987
,
providing
money
to
the
markets
if
necessary
to
keep
the
financial
system
afloat
.

The
Fed
provides
money
to
the
banking
system
by
buying
government
securities
from
financial
institutions
.

The
reticence
of
federal
officials
was
evident
in
the
appearance
Sunday
of
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
on
ABC
's
``
This
Week
.

''
``
Secretary
of
the
Treasury
Brady
and
Chairman
Greenspan
and
the
chairman
of
the
SEC
and
others
have
been
in
close
contact
.

I
'm
sure
they
'll
do
what
's
right
,
what
's
prudent
,
what
's
sensible
,
''
he
said
.

When
it
was
suggested
his
comment
was
a
``
non-answer
,
''
Mr.
Darman
replied
:
``
It
is
a
non-answer
.

But
,
in
this
context
,
that
's
the
smart
thing
to
do
.

''
At
the
Treasury
,
Secretary
Brady
issued
a
statement
minimizing
the
stock
market
's
drop
.

``
Today
's
stock
market
decline
does
n't
signal
any
fundamental
change
in
the
condition
of
the
economy
,
''
he
said
.

``
The
economy
remains
well-balanced
,
and
the
outlook
is
for
continued
moderate
growth
.

''
But
administration
officials
conceded
that
Friday
's
drop
carried
the
chance
of
further
declines
this
week
.

``
One
possibility
is
that
this
is
a
surgical
setback
,
reasonably
limited
in
its
breadth
,
and
not
a
major
problem
,
''
said
one
senior
administration
official
,
who
also
asked
that
he
not
be
named
.

``
The
other
is
that
we
see
another
major
disaster
,
like
two
years
ago
.

I
think
that
's
less
likely
.

''
Nevertheless
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
and
Vice
Chairman
Manuel
Johnson
were
in
their
offices
Sunday
evening
,
monitoring
events
as
they
unfolded
in
markets
around
the
world
.

The
action
was
expected
to
begin
with
the
opening
of
the
New
Zealand
foreign
exchange
markets
at
5
p.m.
EST
--
when
stocks
there
plunged
--
and
to
continue
as
the
trading
day
began
later
in
the
evening
in
Tokyo
and
through
early
this
morning
in
Europe
.

Both
the
Treasury
and
the
Fed
planned
to
keep
market
rooms
operating
throughout
the
night
to
monitor
the
developments
.

In
Tokyo
,
share
prices
dropped
sharply
by
1.7
%
in
early
Monday
morning
trading
.

After
the
initial
slide
,
the
market
appeared
to
be
turning
around
but
by
early
afternoon
was
headed
lower
.

In
the
Bush
administration
,
the
lead
is
being
taken
by
Treasury
Secretary
Brady
,
Undersecretary
Robert
Glauber
and
Assistant
Secretary
Mullins
.

The
three
men
worked
together
on
the
so-called
Brady
Commission
,
headed
by
Mr.
Brady
,
which
was
established
after
the
1987
crash
to
examine
the
market
's
collapse
.

As
a
result
they
have
extensive
knowledge
in
financial
markets
,
and
financial
market
crises
.

Mr.
Brady
was
at
the
White
House
Friday
afternoon
when
the
stock
market
's
decline
began
.

He
was
quickly
on
the
phone
with
Mr.
Mullins
,
who
in
turn
was
talking
with
the
chairmen
of
the
New
York
and
Chicago
exchanges
.

Later
,
Mr.
Brady
phoned
Mr.
Greenspan
,
SEC
Chairman
Richard
Breeden
and
numerous
contacts
in
New
York
and
overseas
.

Aides
say
he
continued
to
work
the
phones
through
the
weekend
.

Administration
officials
say
President
Bush
was
briefed
throughout
Friday
afternoon
and
evening
,
even
after
leaving
for
Camp
David
.

He
had
frequent
telephone
consultations
with
Mr.
Brady
and
Michael
Boskin
,
chairman
of
the
counsel
of
economic
advisers
.

Government
officials
tried
throughout
the
weekend
to
render
a
business-as-usual
appearance
in
order
to
avoid
any
sense
of
panic
.

Treasury
Undersecretary
David
Mulford
,
for
instance
,
was
at
a
meeting
of
the
Business
Council
in
Hot
Springs
,
Va.
,
when
the
stock
market
fell
,
and
remained
there
through
the
following
day
.

And
as
of
last
night
,
Fed
Chairman
Greenspan
had
n't
canceled
his
plans
to
address
the
American
Bankers
Association
convention
in
Washington
at
10
a.m.
this
morning
.

Ironically
,
Mr.
Greenspan
was
scheduled
to
address
the
same
convention
in
Dallas
on
Oct.
20
,
1987
.

He
flew
to
Dallas
on
Oct.
19
,
when
the
market
plummeted
508
points
,
but
then
turned
around
the
next
morning
and
returned
to
Washington
without
delivering
his
speech
.

Put
down
that
phone
.

Walk
around
the
room
;
take
two
deep
breaths
.

Resist
the
urge
to
call
your
broker
and
sell
all
your
stocks
.

That
's
the
advice
of
most
investment
professionals
after
Friday
's
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

No
one
can
say
for
sure
what
will
happen
today
.

And
investment
pros
are
divided
on
whether
stocks
will
perform
well
or
badly
in
the
next
six
months
.

But
they
're
nearly
unanimous
on
one
point
:
Do
n't
sell
into
a
panic
.

Investors
who
sold
everything
after
the
crash
of
1987
lived
to
regret
it
.

Even
after
Friday
's
plunge
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
was
48
%
above
where
it
landed
on
Oct.
19
two
years
ago
.

Panic
selling
also
was
unwise
during
other
big
declines
in
the
past
.

The
crash
of
1929
was
followed
by
a
substantial
recovery
before
the
great
Depression
and
awful
bear
market
of
the
1930s
began
.

The
``
October
massacres
''
of
1978
and
1979
were
scary
,
but
did
n't
lead
to
severe
or
sustained
downturns
.

Indeed
,
some
pros
see
Friday
's
plunge
,
plus
any
further
damage
that
might
occur
early
this
week
,
as
a
chance
for
bargain
hunting
.

``
There
has
been
a
lot
of
emotional
selling
that
presents
a
nice
buying
opportunity
if
you
've
got
the
cash
,
''
says
Stephen
B.
Timbers
,
chief
investment
officer
of
Chicago-based
Kemper
Financial
Services
Inc
.

But
most
advisers
think
the
immediate
course
for
individual
investors
should
be
to
stand
pat
.

``
When
you
see
a
runaway
train
,
''
says
Steve
Janachowski
,
partner
in
the
San
Francisco
investment
advisory
firm
Brouwer
&
Janachowski
,
``
you
wait
for
the
train
to
stop
.

''
Even
for
people
who
expect
a
bear
market
in
coming
months
--
and
a
sizable
number
of
money
managers
and
market
pundits
do
--
the
advice
is
:
Wait
for
the
market
to
bounce
back
,
and
sell
shares
gradually
during
rallies
.

The
best
thing
individual
investors
can
do
is
``
just
sit
tight
,
''
says
Marshall
B.
Front
,
executive
vice
president
and
head
of
investment
counseling
at
Stein
Roe
&
Farnham
Inc.
,
a
Chicago-based
investment
counseling
firm
that
manages
about
$
18
billion
.

On
the
one
hand
,
Mr.
Front
says
,
it
would
be
misguided
to
sell
into
``
a
classic
panic
.

''
On
the
other
hand
,
it
's
not
necessarily
a
good
time
to
jump
in
and
buy
.

``
This
is
all
emotion
right
now
,
and
when
emotion
starts
to
run
,
it
can
run
further
than
anyone
anticipates
,
''
he
said
.

``
So
it
's
more
prudent
to
wait
and
see
how
things
stabilize
.

Ibbotson
,
professor
of
finance
at
Yale
University

of

firm

Inc.
,
says
,
``

real
advice
would

ride
through
it

Generally
,
it
is
n't
wise
to
be

and
out
''
of
the
stock
market
.

Mr.
Ibbotson
thinks
that
this
week
is
``
going
to
be
a
roller-coaster
week
.

''
But
he
also
thinks
it
is
``
a
good
week
to
consider

One
camp
of
investment
pros
sees
what
happened
Friday
as
an
opportunity
.

Over
the
next
days
and
weeks
,
they
say
,
investors
should
look
for

to
buy

to
pick
up
more

today

real
trouble
,
''
he
says
.

He
argues
that
stocks
are
reasonably
valued
now
,
and
that
interest
rates
are
lower
now
than
in
the
fall
of
1987
.

Mr.
Front
of
Stein
Roe
suggests
that
any
buying
should
``
concentrate
in
stocks
that
have
lagged
the
market
on
the
up
side
,
or
stocks
that
have
been
beaten
down
a
lot
more
than
the
market
in
this
correction
.

''
His
firm
favors
selected
computer
,
drug
and
pollution-control
stocks
.

Other
investment
pros
are
more
pessimistic
.

They
say
investors
should
sell
stocks
--
but
not
necessarily
right
away
.

Many
of
them
stress
that
the
selling
can
be
orderly
,
gradual
,
and
done
when
stock
prices
are
rallying
.

On
Thursday
,
William
Fleckenstein
,
a
Seattle
money
manager
,
used
futures
contracts
in
his
personal
account
to
place
a
bet
that
the
broad
market
averages
would
decline
.

He
thinks
the
underlying
inflation
rate
is
around
5
%
to
6
%
,
far
higher
than
most
people
suppose
.

In
the
pension
accounts
he
manages
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
has
raised
cash
positions
and
invested
in
gold
and
natural
gas
stocks
,
partly
as
an
inflation
hedge
.

He
thinks
government
officials
are
terrified
to
let
a
recession
start
when
government
,
corporate
and
personal
debt
levels
are
so
high
.

So
he
thinks
the
government
will
err
on
the
side
of
rekindled
inflation
.

As
a
result
,
Mr.
Fleckenstein
says
,
``
I
think
the
ball
game
's
over
,
''
and
investors
are
about
to
face
a
bear
market
.

David
M.
Jones
,
vice
president
at
Aubrey
G.
Lanston
&
Co.
,
recommends
Treasury
securities
(
of
up
to
five
years
'
maturity
)
.

He
says
the
Oct.
6
employment
report
,
showing
slower
economic
growth
and
a
severe
weakening
in
the
manufacturing
sector
,
is
a
warning
sign
to
investors
.

One
strategy
for
investors
who
want
to
stay
in
but
hedge
their
bets
is
to
buy
``
put
''
options
,
either
on
the
individual
stocks
they
own
or
on
a
broad
market
index
.

A
put
option
gives
its
holder
the
right
(
but
not
the
obligation
)
to
sell
a
stock
(
or
stock
index
)
for
a
specified
price
(
the
strike
price
)
until
the
option
expires
.

Whether
this
insurance
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
an
option
.

The
cost
,
or
premium
,
tends
to
get
fat
in
times
of
crisis
.

Thus
,
buying
puts
after
a
big
market
slide
can
be
an
expensive
way
to
hedge
against
risk
.

The
prices
of
puts
generally
did
n't
soar
Friday
.

For
example
,
the
premium
as
a
percentage
of
the
stock
price
for
certain
puts
on
Eli
Lilly
&
Co.
moved
up
from
3
%
at
Thursday
's
close
to
only
3.3
%
at
Friday
's
close
,
even
though
the
shares
dropped
more
than
$
5.50
.

But
put-option
prices
may
zoom
when
trading
resumes
today
.

It
's
hard
to
generalize
about
a
reasonable
price
for
puts
.

But
investors
should
keep
in
mind
,
before
paying
too
much
,
that
the
average
annual
return
for
stock
holdings
,
long-term
,
is
9
%
to
10
%
a
year
;
a
return
of
15
%
is
considered
praiseworthy
.

Paying
,
say
,
10
%
for
insurance
against
losses
takes
a
deep
bite
out
of
the
return
.

Coldwell
Banker
Commercial
Group
said
it
sold
$
47
million
of
common
stock
to
its
employees
at
$
10
a
share
,
giving
them
a
total
stake
of
more
than
40
%
in
the
commercial
real
estate
brokerage
firm
.

The
firm
,
which
was
acquired
in
April
from
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
in
a
management-led
buy-out
,
had
planned
to
sell
up
to
$
56.4
million
of
stock
,
or
a
50
%
stake
in
the
company
,
to
its
5,000
employees
.

Though
the
offering
did
n't
sell
out
,
James
J.
Didion
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
,
``
We
're
pretty
proud
of
the
employees
'
response
.

''
He
noted
that
unlike
an
employee
stock
ownership
plan
,
where
a
company
usually
borrows
money
from
third
party
lenders
to
buy
stock
that
it
sets
aside
to
award
employees
over
time
,
here
employees
had
to
fork
out
their
own
cash
for
the
stock
.

``
They
came
up
with
their
own
money
instead
of
borrowed
money
,
''
Mr.
Didion
said
.

``
It
's
totally
different
.

''
He
said
the
offering
was
designed
to
create
long-term
incentives
for
employees
.

``
We
're
in
a
service
business
,
and
in
that
context
,
it
's
vital
to
have
your
employees
involved
in
the
ownership
so
they
have
a
stake
in
the
success
.

''
The
brokerage
firm
wo
n't
pay
a
dividend
on
the
stock
.

Employees
have
the
right
to
trade
stock
among
themselves
,
and
the
company
will
establish
an
internal
clearing
house
for
these
transactions
.

They
may
also
eventually
sell
the
shares
to
third
parties
,
but
the
outside
investors
who
own
the
remaining
60
%
of
Coldwell
Banker
have
the
right
to
first
refusal
.

Those
outside
investors
in
Coldwell
Banker
include
Carlyle
Group
,
a
closely
held
Washington
,
D.C.
,
merchant
banking
firm
whose
co-chairman
is
Frank
Carlucci
,
former
secretary
of
defense
;
Frederic
V.
Malek
,
senior
adviser
to
Carlyle

;
Mellon
Family

of
Pittsburgh
;
Westinghouse

of
Westinghouse

Bankers

a

;
and
a
group
of
Japanese
investors
represented
by
the
investment
banking
unit
of
Tokyo-based
Sumitomo
Bank
.

Bankers
Trust
and
Sumitomo
financed
the
$
300
million
acquisition
from
Sears
Roebuck
.

Coldwell
Banker
also
named
three
outside
director
nominees
for
its
17
member
board
.

The
nominees
are
Gary
Wilson
,
chief
financial
officer
of
Walt
Disney
Co.
;
James
Montgomery
,
chief
executive
officer
of
Great
Western
Financial
Corp.
;
and
Peter
Ubberroth
,
former
commissioner
of
baseball
and
now
a
private
investor
.

The
first
major
event
this
morning
in
U.S.
stock
and
futures
trading
may
be
a
pause
at
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.

Under
a
reform
arising
from
the
1987
crash
,
trading
in
the
Merc
's
stock-index
futures
will
break
for
10
minutes
if
the
contract
opens
and
stays
five
points
from
Friday
's
close
,
a
move
equal
to
40
points
on
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

The
aim
of
the
interruption
would
be
to
ease
the
opening
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
which
would
be
hammered
by
such
a
volatile
move
on
the
Merc
.

That
early-morning
breather
is
just
one
of
a
number
of
safeguards
adopted
after
the
1987
crash
.

The
Big
Board
also
added
computer
capacity
to
handle
huge
surges
in
trading
volume
.

Several
of
those
post-crash
changes
kicked
in
during
Friday
's
one-hour
collapse
and
worked
as
expected
,
even
though
they
did
n't
prevent
a
stunning
plunge
.

But
the
major
``
circuit
breakers
''
have
yet
to
be
evaluated
.

A
deeper
market
plunge
today
could
give
them
their
first
test
.

A
further
slide
also
would
resurrect
debate
over
a
host
of
other
,
more
sweeping
changes
proposed
--
but
not
implemented
--
after
the
last
crash
.

Most
notably
,
several
of
the
regulatory
steps
recommended
by
the
Brady
Task
Force
,
which
analyzed
the
1987
crash
,
would
be
revived
--
especially
because
that
group
's
chairman
is
now
the
Treasury
secretary
.

The
most
controversial
of
the
Brady
recommendations
involved
establishing
a
single
overarching
regulator
to
handle
crucial
cross-market
questions
,
such
as
setting
consistent
margin
requirements
for
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

But
for
the
moment
,
attention
focuses
on
the
reforms
that
were
put
into
place
,
and
market
regulators
and
participants
said
the
circuit
breakers
worked
as
intended
.

Big
Board
and
Merc
officials
expressed
satisfaction
with
the
results
of
two
limits
imposed
on
of
the
Merc
's
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
contract
,
as
well
as
``
hot-line
''
communications
among
exchanges
.

Those
pauses
--
from
2:07
p.m.
to
2:30
p.m.
CDT
and
from
2:45
p.m.
until
the
close
of
trading
a
half-hour
later
--
forced
traders
to
buy
and
sell
contracts
at
prices
at
or
higher
than
their
frozen
levels
.

During
the
first
halt
,
after
the
S&P
index
had
fallen
12
points
,
the
Big
Board
's
``
Sidecar
''
computer
program
automatically
was
triggered
.

That
system
is
designed
to
separate
computer-generated
program
trades
from
all
other
trades
to
help
exchange
officials
resolve
order
imbalances
in
individual
stocks
.

One
Merc
broker
compared
the
action
in
the
S&P
pit
during
the
two
freezes
to
a
fire
at
a
well-drilled
school
.

``
You
do
n't
want
the
fire
but
you
know
what
to
do
,
''
said
Howard
Dubnow
,
an
independent
floor
broker
and
a
Merc
governor
.

``
There
was
no
panic
.

The
system
worked
the
way
we
devised
it
to
work
.

''
After
reopening
for
about
15
minutes
,
the
S&P
index
tumbled
to
its
30-point
limit
and
the
second
freeze
went
into
effect
.

Traders
then
spent
the
last
half-hour
``
watching
to
see
if
the
Dow
would
drop
250
points
,
''
Mr.
Dubnow
added
,
referring
to
the
level
at
which
the
stock
market
itself
would
have
closed
for
an
hour
.

One
observer
estimated
that
80
%
to
90
%
of
the
S&P
traders
``
were
just
standing
around
watching
.

''
But
the
250-point
circuit
breaker
never
had
to
kick
in
,
and
freezes
on
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
's
Major
Market
Index
also
were
n't
triggered
.

The
MMI
and
the
S&P
500
are
the
two
major
indexes
used
by
program
traders
to
run
their
computerized
trading
strategies
.

The
programs
are
considered
by
many
to
be
a
major
cause
of
the
1987
crash
.

The
process
of
post-crash
reforms
began
with
calls
to
remake
the
markets
and
wound
up
a
year
later
with
a
series
of
rather
technical
adjustments
.

In
October
1987
,
just
after
the
market
drop
,
Washington
was
awash
in
talk
of
sweeping
changes
in
the
way
the
financial
markets
are
structured
and
regulated
.

Over
the
next
year
that
grand
agenda
was
whittled
down
to
a
series
of
steps
to
soften
big
stock
drops
by
interrupting
trading
to
give
market
players
time
to
pause
and
reconsider
positions
.

In
addition
,
limits
were
placed
on
computer-driven
trading
,
and
steps
were
taken
to
better
link
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

Few
changes
were
made
in
the
way
the
markets
are
regulated
.

At
the
outset
the
prime
target
was
program
trading
,
which
was
much
discussed
but
little
understood
on
Capitol
Hill
.

There
were
also
calls
to
strip
the
stock
markets
of
``
derivative
''
products
,
such
as
stock-index
futures
and
options
,
which
Federal
Judge
Stanley
Sporkin
,
for
example
,
likened
to
``
barnacles
attached
to
the
basic
market
.

''
And
there
was
much
criticism
of
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
system
of
having
stock
trades
flow
through
specialists
,
or
market
makers
.

When
the
Brady
Task
Force
's
powerful
analysis
of
the
crash
was
released
in
January
1988
,
it
immediately
reshaped
the
reformers
'
agenda
.

Arguing
that
the
separate
financial
marketplaces
acted
as
one
,
and
concluding
that
the
crash
had
``
raised
the
possibility
of
a
full-scale
financial
system
breakdown
,
''
the
presidential
task
force
called
for
establishing
a
super-regulator
to
oversee
the
markets
,
to
make
margins
consistent
across
markets
,
to
unify
clearing
systems
and
to
install
circuit
breakers
.

Only
the
last
of
those
recommendations
ever
was
implemented
.

The
Reagan
White
House
held
the
Brady
recommendations
at
arm
's
length
and
named
a
second
panel
--
the
Working
Group
on
the
Financial
Markets
--
to
review
its
analysis
and
those
of
other
crash
studies
.

In
May
1988
,
the
Working
Group
,
made
up
of
representatives
from
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
Treasury
,
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
and
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
,
finally
endorsed
only
circuit
breakers
.

After
several
more
months
of
arguments
among
various
stock
exchanges
and
futures
markets
,
circuit
breakers
were
set
in
place
,
with
the
most
notable
suspending
trading
after
250
and
400
point
drops
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

Privately
,
some
free
marketeers
dismissed
such
mechanisms
as
sops
to
interventionists
.

After
all
,
this
free-market
argument
went
,
the
Dow
only
dropped
more
than
250
points
once
this
century
.

``
Circuit
breakers
''
set
to
soften
big
drops
:
--
If
S&P
futures
fall
5
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
25
points
at
opening
,
contract
trading
pauses
for
10
minutes
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
12
points
(
equivalent
to
about
100
points
on
DJIA
)
,
trading
is
frozen
for
half
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

On
NYSE
program
trades
are
diverted
into
a
separate
computer
file
to
determine
buy
and
sell
orders
.

--
If
S&P
futures
fall
30
points
,
trading
is
restricted
for
an
hour
to
that
price
or
higher
.

--
If
Dow
Industrials
fall
250
points
,
trading
on
the
Big
Board
halts
for
an
hour
.

S&P
and
MMI
contracts
also
halt
.

--
If
DJIA
drops
400
points
,
Big
Board
halts
trading
for
two
hours
.

Trading
in
MMI
and
S&P
futures
also
halted
.

Congressional
proposal
:
--
Create
a
task
force
to
review
current
state
of
the
securities
markets
and
securities
laws
.

Breaking
the
Soviet
government
's
television
monopoly
,
an
independent
company
has
gained
rights
to
show
world
programming
,
including
American
films
.

``
There
must
not
be
a
monopoly
,
there
must
be
freedom
of
choice
for
both
journalists
and
viewers
,
''
Nikolai
I.
Lutsenko
,
the
president
of
the
Nika
TV
company
,
told
the
weekly
newspaper
Nedelya
.

The
company
is
already
working
on
its
own
programming
in
several
provincial
cities
and
hopes
to
be
on
the
air
regularly
in
about
a
year
,
the
newspaper
said
.

Mr.
Lutsenko
told
Nedelya
that
he
recently
had
been
to
the
U.S.
to
pick
up
the
rights
to
show
5,000
U.S.
films
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

Nedelya
's
article
was
accompanied
by
a
picture
of
Mr.
Lutsenko
interviewing
singer
John
Denver
in
Colorado
.

Even
though
it

South
Africa
's
National
Union
of
Mineworkers
said
that
about
10,000
diamond
miners
struck
for
higher
wages
at
De
Beers
Consolidated
Mines
Ltd.
De
Beers
said
that
workers
at
five
of
the
group
's
mines
were
on
strike
,
which
it
said
was
peaceful
,
with
orderly
picketing
occurring
at
one
of
the
mines
.

The
deadlock
in
negotiations
occurred
with
De
Beers
offering
a
17
%
increase
in
the
minimum-wage
category
while
the
union
demanded
a
37.6
%
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
.

Japan
's
opposition
Socialist
Party
denied
that
its
legislators
had
been
bribed
by
pinball-parlor
owners
.

The
allegation
had
been
raised
in
Parliament
by
the
governing
Liberal
Democratic
Party
following
magazine
reports
suggesting
that
money
from
Japanese-style
pinball
,
called
pachinko
,
had
infiltrated
politics
.

Tsuruo
Yamaguchi
,
secretary
general
of
the
Socialist
Party
,
acknowledged
that
nine
party
lawmakers
had
received
donations
from
the
pachinko
association
totaling
8
million
yen
(
about
$
55,000
)
but
said
the
donations
were
legal
and
none
of
its
members
acted
to
favor
the
industry
.

The
World
Wide
Fund
for
Nature
said
that
Spain
,
Argentina
,
Thailand
and
Indonesia
were
doing
too
little
to
prevent
illegal
trade
in
endangered
wildlife
across
their
borders
.

A
report
by
the
conservation
group
presented
at
the
U.N.-sponsored
Convention
on
International
Trade
in
Endangered
Species
in
Lausanne
accused
the
four
of
trading
protected
species
ranging
from
parakeets
to
orchids
.

Fund
official
Simon
Lyster
said
world
trade
in
wildlife
was
estimated
to
total
$
5
billion
of
business
annually
.

A
NATO
project
to
build
a
frigate
for
the
1990s
was
torpedoed
by
the
pull-out
of
three
of
its
eight
participating
nations
.

Britain
,
France
and
Italy
announced
technical
reasons
for
withdrawing
,
but
some
officials
pointed
to
growing
reluctance
among
the
allies
to
commit
themselves
to
big
defense
spending
while
East-West
disarmament
talks
show
signs
of
success
.

Small
wonder
that
Britain
's
Labor
Party
wants
credit
controls
.

A
few
hours
after
the
party
launched
its
own
affinity
credit
card
earlier
this
month
,
the
Tories
raised
the
nation
's
base
interest
rate
.

Labor
's
Visa
card
is
believed
to
be
the
first
linked
to
a
British
political
party
.

Labor
gets
25
pence
(
39
cents
)
for
every
100
(
about
$
155
)
that
a
user
charges
to
the
card
.

As
with
other
plastic
in
Britain
's
high-interest-rate
environment
,
the
Labor
card
,
administered
by
Co-operative
Bank
,
carries
a
stiff
(
in
this
case
,
29.8
%
)
annual
rate
on
the
unpaid
balance
.

China
's
year-long
austerity
program
has
achieved
some
successes
in
harnessing
runaway
economic
growth
and
stabilizing
prices
but
has
failed
to
eliminate
serious
defects
in
state
planning
and
an
alarming
drain
on
state
budgets
.

The
official
China
Daily
said
retail
prices
of
non-staple
foods
have
n't
risen
since
last
December
but
acknowledged
that
huge
government
subsidies
were
a
main
factor
in
keeping
prices
down
.

The
State
Statistical
Bureau
found
that
more
than
1
billion
yuan
(
$
270
million
)
was
spent
in
the
first
half
of
the
year
for
pork
subsidies
.

The
newspaper
quoted
experts
as
saying
the
subsidies
would
cause
the
difference
between
prices
and
real
values
of
commodities
to
``
become
very
unreasonable
''
and
reduce
needed
funds
for
investment
in
the
``
already
difficult
state
budget
.

''
The
aim
of
the
austerity
measures
was
to
slice
economic
growth
,
which
soared
to
20.7
%
last
year
,
to
8
%
in
1990
.

Economists
now
predict
the
growth
rate
will
be
about
11.5
%
for
the
year
.

In
a
sign
of
growing
official
tolerance
for
religion
,
Russian
Orthodox
priests
were
allowed
to
celebrate
the
400th
anniversary
of
the
Moscow
patriarchate
in
the
Kremlin
's
15th-century
Uspensky
Cathedral
,
where
czars
were
crowned
...
.

A
34-foot-tall
,
$
7.7
million
statue
of
Buddha
was
completed
on
a
hill
outside
Hong
Kong
,
facing
China
.

The
statue
is
the
brainchild
of
Sik
Chi
Wan
,
director
of
the
Po
Lin
Monastery
,
who
said
:
``
Hong
Kong
is
such
a
prosperous
place
,
we
also
need
some
kind
of
religious
symbol
.

''
It
all
seemed
innocent
enough
:
Last
April
,
one
Steven
B.
Iken
visited
Justin
Products
Inc.
here
,
identified
himself
as
a
potential
customer
and
got
the
word
on
the
little
company
's
new
cassette
players
for
children
.

``
It
is
almost
identical
to
the
Sony
product
,
''
Mr.
Iken
remarked
,
after
seeing
prototypes
and
pictures
.

Replied
a
Justin
salesman
:
``
Exactly
.

''
The
Justin
merchandise
carried
wholesale
prices
some
40
%
below
those
of
Sony
Corp.
of
Japan
's
``
My
First
Sony
''
line
.

The
visitor
waxed
enthusiastic
and
promised
to
return
.

But
instead
of
a
new
customer
--
part
of
a
hoped-for
bonanza
from
underselling
Sony
--
Justin
got
a
costly
legal
morass
.

Mr.
Iken
,
it
turned
out
,
was
a
private
detective
using
a
hidden
tape
recorder
to
gather
information
for
Sony
.

His
recording
later
turned
up
as
a
court
exhibit
.

Seeking
to
keep
Justin
's
``
My
Own
''
product
line
off
the
U.S.
market
,
Sony
last
May
filed
a
suit
in
Manhattan
federal
court
accusing
the
upstart
of
trademark
infringement
,
unfair
competition
and
other
violations
of
business
law
.

Since
then
,
life
has
changed
a
lot
for
61-year-old
Leonard
Kaye
,
Justin
's
owner
.

``
I
have
n't
been
able
to
get
a
decent
night
's
sleep
since
this
has
been
going
on
,
''
he
says
.

``
It
's
the
most
distracting
thing
in
my
life
--
I
ca
n't
even
attend
to
my
business
.

''
His
company
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
25
million
)
may
suffer
a
costly
blow
--
losing
an
estimated
10
%
of
total
sales
--
if
Sony
(
annual
sales
:
about
$
16
billion
)
prevails
.

Justin
's
plight
shows
what
can
happen
when
a
tiny
company
suddenly
faces
the
full
legal
might
of
a
wrathful
multinational
.

With
considerable
irony
,
the
case
also
shows
how
completely
Japan
has
turned
the
tables
on
U.S.
business
.

Americans
used
to
complain
bitterly
about
being
undersold
by
look-alike
products
from
Japan
.

Now
Sony
,
whose
innovative
,
premium-priced
products
are
among
the
most
admired
in
consumer
electronics
,
is
bitterly
complaining
about
a
little
U.S.
firm
with
a
cheap
look-alike
produced
in
China
.

``
The
gist
of
this
is
that
Justin
knocked
off
the
Sony
line
and
Sony
wants
to
stop
it
,
''
says
Lewis
H.
Eslinger
,
Sony
's
attorney
,
who
previously
guarded
Rubik
's
Cube
.

(
Sony
itself
declines
to
comment
.

)
If
Sony
wins
,
Mr.
Eslinger
says
,
its
little
rival
will
have
to
try
to
sell
the
products
overseas
.

At
worst
,
he
adds
,
``
They
'd
have
to
grind
them
all
up
and
throw
them
away
.

''
Mr.
Kaye
denies
the
suit
's
charges
and
says
his
only
mistake
was
taking
on
Sony
in
the
marketplace
.

``
I
made
a
similar
line
and
I
produced
it
cheaper
,
''
he
says
.

Today
,
U.S.
Judge
John
E.
Sprizzo
is
expected
to
rule
on
Sony
's
renewed
request
for
a
pre-trial
order
blocking
sale
of
the
disputed
products
,
on
which
deliveries
began
in
July
.

The
judge
turned
down
an
earlier
Sony
request
for
such
an
order
--
a
decision
upheld
on
appeal
--
but
Sony
returned
with
additional
evidence
and
arguments
.

Though
hoping
to
settle
the
case
,
Justin
vows
to
fight
on
,
if
necessary
.

But
the
battle
is
more
than
Justin
bargained
for
.

``
I
had
no
idea
I
was
getting
in
so
deep
,
''
says
Mr.
Kaye
,
who
founded
Justin
in
1982
.

Mr.
Kaye
had
sold
Capetronic
Inc.
,
a
Taiwan
electronics
maker
,
and
retired
,
only
to
find
he
was
bored
.

With
Justin
,
he
began
selling
toys
and
electronics
made
mostly
in
Hong
Kong
,
beginning
with
Mickey
Mouse
radios
.

The
company
has
grown
--
to
about
40
employees
,
from
four
initially
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
.

Justin
has
been
profitable
since
1986
,
adds
the
official
,
who
shares
his
office
with
numerous
teddy
bears
,
all
samples
from
his
line
of
plush
toys
.

Like
many
others
,
Mr.
Kaye
took
notice
in
1987
when
Sony
,
in
a
classic
example
of
market
segmentation
,
changed
the
plastic
skin
and
buttons
on
the
famous
Walkman
line
of
portable
audio
equipment
and
created
the
My
First
Sony
line
for
children
.

The
brightly
colored
new
products
looked
more
like
toys
than
the
adult
models
.

(
In
court
papers
,
Sony
says
it
has
spent
more
than
$
3
million
to
promote
the
line
,
with
resulting
sales
of
over
a
million
units
.

)
Sony
found
a
new
market
niche
,
but
Mr.
Kaye
figured
that
its
prices
left
plenty
of
room
for
a
lower-priced
competitor
.

His
products
are
n't
exact
copies
of
Sony
's
but
strongly
resemble
them
in
size
,
shape
and
,
especially
,
color
.

Sony
uses
mostly
red
and
blue
,
with
traces
of
yellow
--
and
so
does
Justin
,
on
the
theory
that
kids
prefer
these
colors
.

(
``
To
be
successful
,
a
product
can
be
any
color
whatsoever
,
as
long
as
it
is
fire-engine
red
,
''
says
Charles
E.
Baxley
,
Justin
's
attorney
.

)
By
last
winter
,
Justin
was
showing
prototypes
at
toy
fairs
in
Hong
Kong
and
New
York
--
and
Sony
noticed
.

Indeed
,
concerned
that
Sony
sales
personnel
were
threatening
legal
action
or
other
retaliation
--
such
as
withholding
desirable
Sony
products
--
against
Justin
's
customers
,
Mr.
Baxley
fired
off
a
letter
to
Sony
in
April
.

He
himself
threatened
to
take
the
matter
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
or
U.S.
Justice
Department
.

But
Justin
has
n't
pursued
those
charges
(
which
were
without
merit
,
according
to
Mr.
Eslinger
,
the
Sony
attorney
)
.

Recalls
Mr.
Baxley
:
``
Our
purpose
was
to
influence
them
to
leave
us
alone
.

We
never
intended
taking
on
Sony
--
we
do
n't
have
the
resources
.

''
Sony
answered
the
empty
threat
with
its
real
suit
.

Off
and
on
since
then
,
the
companies
have
skirmished
in
court
.

And
Justin
,
in
a
news
release
,
says
,
``
Once
competitive
,
Sony
now
resorts
to
strong-arm
tactics
in
American
courtrooms
to
carve
out
and
protect
niche
markets
.

''
Sony
's
lawyer
insists
that
the
company
's
tactics
--
including
the
use
of
a
private
detective
posing
as
a
buyer
--
are
routine
in
such
matters
.

He
also
insists
that
Sony
,
no
less
than
others
,
has
a
legal
right
to
protect
its
``
trade
dress
,
''
in
this
case
,
mostly
the
colors
that
it
claims
make
My
First
Sony
products
distinctive
.

(
Justin
claims
it
began
using
the
same
colors
on
electronic
goods
for
children
long
before
Sony
entered
the
children
's
market
.

)
Whatever
its
merits
,
Sony
's
aggressive
defense
is
debilitating
for
Justin
.

It
's
also
costly
.

Mr.
Kaye
says
he
has
paid
more
than
$
70,000
in
legal
fees
so
far
.

Of
Sony
,
Mr.
Kaye
says
:
``
They
know
there
's
no
way
for
them
to
lose
.

They
just
keep
digging
me
in
deeper
until
I
reach
the
point
where
I
give
up
and
go
away
.

''
For
now
,
though
,
he
vows
to
hang
in
.

.

The
previous
agreement
expired
Thursday
.

Hammond
said
that
its
discussions
with
Fidelity
,
an
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
title-insurance
underwriter
,
are
continuing
,
but
that
prospects
for
a
longer-term
standstill
agreement
are
uncertain
.

Fidelity
has
increased
its
stake
in
Hammond
to
23.57
%
in
recent
months
.

Statements
made
in
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filings
led
Hammond
to
request
a
standstill
agreement
.

Giant
Group
Ltd.
said
it
terminated
negotiations
for
the
purchase
of
Aspen
Airways
,
a
Denver-based
regional
carrier
that
operates
the
United
Express
connector
service
under
contract
to
UAL
Corp.
's
United
Airlines
.

Giant
,
a
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
collection
of
companies
that
is
controlled
by
Hollywood
producer
Burt
Sugarman
,
did
n't
give
a
reason
for
halting
its
plan
to
acquire
the
airline
,
and
Aspen
officials
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

Giant
agreed
last
month
to
purchase
the
carrier
.

Giant
has
n't
ever
disclosed
the
proposed
price
,
although
Avmark
Inc.
,
an
Arlington
,
Va.-based
aircraft
consulting
concern
,
has
valued
Aspen
's
fleet
at
about
$
46
million
.

The
airline
would
have
become
the
latest
in
a
peculiar
blend
of
Giant
companies
,
which
are
involved
in
making
cement
,
recycling
newsprint
and
operating
fast-food
restaurants
.

The
state-controlled
insurer
Assurances
Generales
de
France
said
it
has
obtained
regulatory
approval
to
increase
its
stake
in
the
financial
holding
company
Cie.
de
Navigation
Mixte
above
10
%
from
the
current
level
of
about
8
%
.

Friday
's
approval
was
needed
to
conform
with
Bourse
rules
regarding
companies
with
bank
interests
and
follows
a
similar
approval
given
Wednesday
to
Cie
.

Financiere
de
Paribas
.

Both
Paribas
and
AGF
have
been
increasing
their
stakes
in
Navigation
Mixte
recently
for
what
they
have
termed
``
investment
purposes
,
''
although
the
issue
has
been
surrounded
by
takeover
speculation
in
recent
weeks
.

AGF
did
n't
comment
officially
on
its
reasons
for
seeking
the
approval
,
but
people
close
to
the
group
said
it
was
done
to
make
sure
the
group
would
have
the
flexibility
to
increase
its
stake
in
the
future
,
should
interesting
price
opportunities
arise
.

An
AGF
official
did
specify
,
however
,
that
there
was
no
foundation
to
recent
rumors
the
group
might
be
acting
in
concert
with
Paribas
.

Lockheed
Aeronautical
Systems
Co.
,
a
unit
of
Lockheed
Corp.
,
said
it
agreed
to
join
with
Aermacchi
S.p
.

A.
of
Varese
,
Italy
,
to
propose
a
new
generation
of
jet
trainers
for
the
U.S.
Air
Force
.

The
Air
Force
is
looking
to
buy
540
new
primary
jet
trainers
,
with
a
total
value
of
$
1.5
billion
to
$
2
billion
,
between
1994
and
2004
.

The
aircraft
would
replace
the
T-37
,
made
by
the
Cessna
Aircraft
Co.
unit
of
General
Dynamics
Corp.
,
which
the
Air
Force
uses
to
train
jet
pilots
.

Lockheed
said
the
U.S.
Navy
may
also
buy
an
additional
340
trainer
aircraft
to
replace
its
T34C
trainers
made
by
the
Beech
Aircraft
Corp.
unit
of
Raytheon
Corp
.

Under
the
agreement
with
Lockheed
,
Aermacchi
will
license
Lockheed
to
build
the
Aermacchi
MB-339
jet
tandem-trainer
and
will
supply
certain
structures
.

Lockheed
will
build
additional
structures
and
perform
final
assembly
of
the
tandem-seat
trainer
at
its
Marietta
,
Ga.
,
plant
should
the
Air
Force
order
the
craft
.

A
Lockheed
spokesman
in
Burbank
,
Calif.
,
said
he
was
n't
aware
of
which
other
companies
would
be
competing
for
the
Air
Force
contract
.

Striking
auto
workers
ended
their
19-day
occupation
of
a
metal
shop
at
a
Peugeot
S.A.
factory
in
eastern
France
Friday
as
pay
talks
got
under
way
in
the
capital
.

But
the
Peugeot
breakthrough
came
as
a
nationwide
dispute
by
Finance
Ministry
employees
disrupted
border
checkpoints
and
threatened
the
government
's
ability
to
pay
its
bills
.

The
Peugeot
metalworkers
began
filing
out
of
the
shop
,
which
makes
auto
parts
,
at
the
plant
in
Mulhouse
after
voting
589
to
193
to
abandon
the
occupation
.

Their
withdrawal
was
based
on
promises
by
Peugeot
to
open
negotiations
in
Paris
at
the
same
time
the
last
man
left
the
premises
.

The
strike
by
customs
officers
,
tax
collectors
,
treasury
workers
and
other
civil
servants
attached
to
the
Ministry
of
Finance
may
pose
a
more
serious
challenge
to
the
government
and
the
average
Frenchman
.

Ministry
employees
complain
that
they
are
poorly
paid
because
of
a
complex
job-rating
system
they
say
fails
to
take
into
account
their
education
and
level
of
technical
expertise
.

The
market
for
$
200
billion
of
high-risk
junk
bonds
,
battered
by
a
succession
of
defaults
and
huge
price
declines
this
year
,
practically
vanished
Friday
.

Trading
ground
to
a
halt
as
investors
rushed
to
sell
bonds
,
only
to
find
themselves
deserted
by
potential
buyers
.

Stunned
,
they
watched
brokerage
houses
mark
down
price
quotations
on
their
junk
holdings
while
being
able
to
execute
very
few
actual
trades
.

``
The
junk
bond
market
is
in
a
state
of
gridlock
now
--
there
are
no
bids
,
only
offers
,
''
says
independent
investor
Martin
D.
Sass
,
who
manages
nearly
$
4
billion
and
who
recently
decided
to
buy
distressed
securities
for
a
new
fund
.

This
calamity
is
``
far
from
over
,
''
he
says
.

Junk
's
collapse
helped
stoke
the
panicky
selling
of
stocks
that
produced
the
deepest
one-day
dive
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
since
the
Oct.
19
,
1987
,
crash
.

Simultaneously
,
it
also
helped
trigger
this
year
's
biggest
rally
in
the
U.S.
government
bond
market
as
investors
rushed
to
move
capital
into
the
highest-quality
securities
they
could
find
.

But
``
an
eerie
silence
pervaded
''
the
junk
market
Friday
as
prices
tumbled
on
hundreds
of
high-yield
bonds
despite
``
no
active
trading
,
''
says
John
Lonski
,
an
economist
at
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc
.

For
example
,
the
price
of
Southland
Corp.
's
$
500
million
of
16
%
bonds
due
2002
--
sold
less
than
two
years
ago
by
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
--
plummeted
25
%
to
just
30
cents
on
the
dollar
.

But
not
even
Goldman
would
make
a
market
in
the
securities
of
Southland
,
the
owner
of
the
nationwide
chain
of
7-11
convenience
stores
that
is
strapped
for
cash
.

Goldman
officials
declined
to
comment
.

Junk
bonds
,
which
mushroomed
from
less
than
$
2
billion
at
the
start
of
this
decade
,
have
been
declining
for
months
as
issuer
after
issuer
sank
beneath
the
weight
of
hefty
interest
payments
.

The
shaky
market
received
its
biggest
jolt
last
month
from
Campeau
Corp.
,
which
created
its
U.S.
retailing
empire
with
junk
financing
.

Campeau
developed
a
cash
squeeze
that
caused
it
to
be
tardy
on
some
interest
payments
and
to
put
its
prestigious
Bloomingdales
department-store
chain
up
for
sale
.

Now
,
dozens
of
corporations
,
including
Ethan
Allen
,
TW
Services
and
York
International
,
that
are
counting
on
at
least
$
7
billion
of
scheduled
new
junk
financings
to
keep
their
highly
leveraged
takeovers
and
buy-outs
afloat
,
may
never
get
the
money
.

``
The
music
has
stopped
playing
,
''
says
Michael
Harkins
,
a
principal
in
the
investment
firm
of
Levy
Harkins
.

``
You
've
either
got
a
chair
or
you
do
n't
.

''
In
Friday
's
aftermath
,
says
R.
Douglas
Carleton
,
a
director
of
high-yield
finance
at
First
Boston
Corp.
,
``
much
of
the
$
7
billion
forward
calendar
could
be
deferred
,
depending
on
the
hysteria
.

''
In
August
,
First
Boston
withdrew
a
$
475
million
junk
offering
of
Ohio
Mattress
bonds
because
potential
buyers
were
``
very
skittish
.

''
The
outlook
``
looks
shaky
because
we
're
still
waiting
''
for
mutual
funds
,
in
particular
,
to
dump
some
of
their
junk
bond
holdings
to
pay
off
redemptions
by
individual
investors
,
says
King
Penniman
,
senior
vice
president
at
McCarthy
,
Crisanti
&
Maffei
,
an
investment
arm
of
Xerox
Financial
Services
.

Indeed
,
a
Moody
's
index
that
tracks
the
net
asset
values
of
24
high-yield
mutual
funds
declined
for
the
17th
consecutive
day
Friday
.

In
a
stark
contrast
,
the
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
climbed
more
than
2
points
,
or
about
$
25
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
to
103
,
its
biggest
gain
of
the
year
.

The
bond
's
yield
dropped
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
yield
on
three-month
Treasury
bills
,
considered
the
safest
of
all
investments
,
plummeted
about
0.7
percentage
point
to
7.16
%
,
the
largest
one-day
decline
since
1982
.

The
main
catalyst
for
government
bond
market
rally
was
the
190.58-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

``
When
you
get
panic
in
one
market
,
you
get
flight
to
quality
in
the
other
,
''
said
Maria
Ramirez
,
money
market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

Nevertheless
,
the
problems
of
the
junk
market
could
prompt
the
Federal
Reserve
to
ease
credit
in
the
months
ahead
.

``
This
marks
a
significant
shift
in
the
interest
rate
outlook
,
''
says
William
Sullivan
,
director
of
money
market
research
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc.
,
New
York
.

Any
sustained
credit-easing
could
be
a
lift
for
junk
bonds
as
well
as
other
securities
.

Robert
Dow
,
a
partner
and
portfolio
manager
at
Lord
,
Abbett
&
Co.
,
which
manages
$
4
billion
of
high-yield
bonds
,
says
he
does
n't
``
think
there
is
any
fundamental
economic
rationale
{
for
the
junk
bond
rout
}
.

It
was
herd
instinct
.

''
He
adds
:
``
The
junk
market
has
witnessed
some
trouble
and
now
some
people
think
that
if
the
equity
market
gets
creamed
that
means
the
economy
will
be
terrible
and
that
's
bad
for
junk
.

I
do
n't
believe
that
's
the
case
,
but
I
believe
that
people
are
running
scared
.

There
is
a
flight
to
quality
,
and
the
quality
is
not
in
equities
and
not
in
junk
--
it
's
in
Treasurys
.

''
Even
as
trading
in
high-yield
issues
dried
up
over
the
past
month
,
corporations
sold
more
than
$
2
billion
of
new
junk
bonds
.

For
example
,
a
recent
$
375
million
offering
of
Petrolane
Gas
Services
L.P.
bonds
sold
by
First
Boston
was
three
times
oversubscribed
.

A
$
550
million
offering
of
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc
.

high-yield
securities
sold
last
week
by
Drexel
was
increased
$
50
million
because
of
strong
demand
.

First
Boston
estimates
that
in
November
and
December
alone
,
junk
bond
investors
will
receive
$
4.8
billion
of
coupon
interest
payments
.

``
That
's
a
clear
indication
that
there
is
and
will
be
an
undercurrent
of
basic
business
going
on
,
''
says
Mr.
Carleton
of
First
Boston
.

``
I
do
n't
know
how
people
can
say
the
junk
bond
market
disappeared
when
there
were
$
1.5
billion
of
orders
for
$
550
million
of
junk
bonds
sold
last
week
by
Turner
,
''
says
Raymond
Minella
,
co-head
of
merchant
banking
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

``
When
the
rally
comes
,
insurance
companies
will
be
leading
it
because
they
have
billions
to
invest
and
invest
they
will
.

There
is
plenty
of
money
available
from
people
who
want
to
buy
well-structured
deals
;
it
's
the
stuff
that
's
financed
on
a
shoestring
that
people
are
wary
of
.

''
But
such
highly
leveraged
transactions
seemed
to
have
multiplied
this
year
,
casting
a
pall
over
much
of
the
junk
market
.

Michael
McNamara
,
director
of
fixed-income
research
at
Kemper
Financial
Services
,
says
the
quality
of
junk
issues
has
been
getting
poorer
,
contributing
to
the
slide
in
prices
.

``
Last
year
we
probably
bought
one
out
of
every
three
new
deals
,
''
he
says
.

``
This
year
,
at
best
,
it
's
in
one
in
every
five
or
six
.

And
our
credit
standards
have
n't
changed
one
iota
.

''
However
,
Mr.
McNamara
said
the
slide
in
junk
is
creating
``
one
hell
of
a
buying
opportunity
''
for
selective
buyers
.

For
the
moment
,
investors
seem
more
preoccupied
with
the
``
bad
''
junk
than
the
``
good
''
junk
.

``
The
market
has
been
weak
since
''
the
announcement
of
the
Campeau
cash
squeeze
and
the
company
's
subsequent
bailout
by
Olympia
&
York
,
says
Mr.
Minella
of
Merrill
Lynch
.

``
That
really
affected
the
market
in
that
people
started
to
ask
`
What
else
is
in
trouble
?
'
''
Well
before
Campeau
,
though
,
there
were
signs
that
the
junk
market
was
stumbling
through
one
of
its
worst
years
ever
.

Despite
the
relatively
strong
economy
,
junk
bond
prices
did
nothing
except
go
down
,
hammered
by
a
seemingly
endless
trail
of
bad
news
:
--
In
June
,
two
months
before
it
would
default
on
interest
payments
covering
some
of
its
$
1.2
billion
of
speculative
debt
securities
,
New
York-based
Integrated
Resources
Inc.
said
it
ran
out
of
borrowed
money
.

--
In
July
,
Southmark
Corp.
,
the
Dallas-based
real
estate
and
financial
services
company
with
about
$
1.3
billion
of
junk
bonds
,
voluntarily
filed
for
protection
under
U.S.
bankruptcy
law
.

--
By
the
end
of
July
,
the
difference
in
yield
between
an
index
of
junk
bonds
and
seven-year
Treasury
notes
widened
to
more
than
5.5
percentage
points
.

--
In
August
,
Resorts
International
Inc.
,
which
sold
more
than
$
500
million
of
junk
bonds
,
suspended
interest
payments
.

--
In
September
,
just
as
the
cash
squeeze
hit
Campeau
,
Lomas
Financial
Corp.
defaulted
on
$
145
million
of
notes
and
appeared
unlikely
to
pay
interest
on
a
total
of
$
1.2
billion
of
debt
securities
.

Meantime
,
regulators
are
becoming
increasingly
worried
as
the
rush
to
leverage
shows
no
signs
of
abating
.

Moody
's
says
the
frequency
of
corporate
credit
downgrades
is
the
highest
this
year
since
1982
.

In
addition
,
there
are
six
times
as
many
troubled
banks
as
there
were
in
the
recession
of
1981
,
according
to
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp
.

``
The
era
of
the
1980s
is
about
compound
interest
and
the
reaching
for
it
,
''
says
James
Grant
,
editor
of
Grant
's
Interest
Rate
Observer
,
an
early
critic
of
the
junk
bond
market
.

``
What
we
've
begun
to
see
is
the
damage
to
businesses
of
paying
exorbitant
compound
interest
.

Businesses
were
borrowing
at
interest
rates
higher
than
their
own
earnings
.

What
we
're
seeing
now
is
the
wrenching
readjustment
of
asset
values
to
a
future
when
speculative-grade
debt
will
be
hard
to
obtain
rather
than
easy
.

''
Friday
's
Market
Activity
Prices
of
Treasury
bonds
surged
in
the
biggest
rally
of
the
year
as
investors
fled
a
plummeting
stock
market
.

The
benchmark
30-year
Treasury
bond
was
quoted
6
p.m.
EDT
at
103
,
compared
with
100
Thursday
,
up
2
points
.

The
yield
on
the
benchmark
fell
to
7.82
%
,
the
lowest
since
March
31
,
1987
,
according
to
Technical
Data
Global
Markets
Group
.

The
``
flight
to
quality
''
began
late
in
the
day
and
followed
a
precipitous
fall
in
the
stock
market
.

Treasurys
opened
lower
,
reacting
negatively
to
news
that
the
producer
price
index
--
a
measure
of
inflation
on
the
wholesale
level
--
accelerated
in
September
.

Bond
prices
barely
budged
until
midday
.

Many
bond
market
participants
will
be
closely
eying
the
action
of
the
Federal
Reserve
,
which
might
repeat
its
October
1987
injection
of
huge
amounts
of
liquidity
to
buoy
the
financial
markets
and
keep
the
economy
from
slowing
into
a
recession
.

Prices
of
municipals
,
investment-grade
corporates
and
mortgage-backed
bonds
also
rose
,
but
lagged
behind
their
Treasury
counterparts
.

Mortgage
securities
rose
in
hectic
trading
,
with
most
of
the
activity
concentrated
in
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
9
%
coupon
securities
,
the
most
liquid
mortgage
issue
.

The
Ginnie
Mae
November
9
%
issue
ended
at
98
,
up
point
on
the
day
,
to
yield
about
9.28
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
.

Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
were
up
about
to
point
.

But
the
yield
spread
between
lower-quality
,
investment-grade
issues
and
higher-quality
bonds
widened
.

And
the
yields
on
telephone
and
utility
issues
rose
relative
to
other
investment-grade
bonds
in
anticipation
of
this
week
's
$
3
billion
bond
offering
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
.

Despite
rumors
that
the
TVA
's
long-awaited
offering
would
be
postponed
because
of
the
debacle
in
the
equity
markets
,
sources
in
the
underwriting
syndicate
said
they
expect
the
issue
will
be
priced
as
scheduled
.

One
of
the
sources
said
the
smaller
portions
of
$
750
million
each
of
five-year
and
10-year
bonds
have
already
been
``
substantially
oversubscribed
.

''
Municipal
bonds
rose
as
much
as
point
.

Friday
's
190-point
plunge
in
stocks
does
not
come
atop
the
climate
of
anxiety
that
dominated
financial
markets
just
prior
to
their
1987
October
crash
,
and
mechanisms
have
been
put
in
place
to
keep
markets
more
orderly
.

Still
,
the
lesson
is
about
the
same
:
On
Friday
the
13th
,
the
market
was
spooked
by
Washington
.

The
consensus
along
the
street
seems
to
be
that
the
plunge
was
triggered
by
the
financing
problems
of
the
UAL
takeover
,
and
it
's
certainly
true
the
rout
began
immediately
after
the
UAL
trading
halt
.

Still
,
the
consensus
seems
almost
as
wide
that
one
faltering
bid
is
no
reason
to
write
down
the
value
of
all
U.S.
business
.

This
observation
leads
us
to
another
piece
of
news
moving
on
the
Dow
Jones
ticker
shortly
before
the
downturn
:
the
success
of
Senate
Democrats
in
stalling
the
capital
gains
tax
cut
.

The
real
value
of
all
shares
,
after
all
,
is
directly
impacted
by
the
tax
on
any
profits
(
all
the
more
so
given
the
limits
on
deductions
for
losses
that
show
gains
are
not
``
ordinary
income
''
)
.

And
market
expectations
clearly
have
been
raised
by
the
capital
gains
victory
in
the
House
last
month
.

An
hour
before
Friday
's
plunge
,
that
provision
was
stripped
from
the
tax
bill
,
leaving
it
with
$
5.4
billion
in
tax
increases
without
a
capital
gains
cut
.

There
is
a
great
deal
to
be
said
,
to
be
sure
,
for
stripping
the
garbage
out
of
the
reconciliation
bill
.

It
would
be
a
good
thing
if
Congress
started
to
decide
issues
one-by-one
on
their
individual
merits
without
trickery
.

For
one
thing
,
no
one
doubts
that
the
capital
gains
cut
would
pass
on
an
up-or-down
vote
.

Since
Senate
leaders
have
so
far
fogged
it
up
with
procedural
smokescreens
,
promises
of
a
cleaner
bill
are
suspect
.

Especially
so
since
President
Bush
has
been
weakened
by
the
Panama
fiasco
.

To
the
extent
that
the
UAL
troubles
contributed
to
the
plunge
,
they
are
another
instance
of
Washington
's
sticky
fingers
.

As
the
best
opportunities
for
corporate
restructurings
are
exhausted
of
course
,
at
some
point
the
market
will
start
to
reject
them
.

But
the
airlines
are
scarcely
a
clear
case
,
given
anti-takeover
mischief
by
Secretary
of
Transportation
Skinner
,
who
professes
to
believe
safety
will
be
compromised
if
KLM
and
British
Airways
own
interests
in
companies
that
fly
airplanes
.

Worse
,
Congress
has
started
to
jump
on
the
Skinner
bandwagon
.

James
Oberstar
,
the
Minnesota
Democrat
who
chairs
the
Public
Works
and
Transportation
Committee
's
aviation
subcommittee
,
has
put
an
anti-airline
takeover
bill
on
supersonic
speed
so
that
it
would
be
passed
in
time
to
affect
the
American
and
United
Air
Lines
bids
.

It
would
give
Mr.
Skinner
up
to
50
days
to
``
review
''
any
bid
for
15
%
or
more
of
the
voting
stock
of
any
U.S.
carrier
with
revenues
of
$
1
billion
or
more
.

So
the
UAL
deal
has
problems
,
and
the
market
loses
190
points
.

Congratulations
,
Mr.
Secretary
and
Mr.
Congressman
.

In
the
1987
crash
,
remember
,
the
market
was
shaken
by
a
Danny
Rostenkowski
proposal
to
tax
takeovers
out
of
existance
.

Even
more
important
,
in
our
view
,
was
the
Treasury
's
threat
to
thrash
the
dollar
.

The
Treasury
is
doing
the
same
thing
today
;
thankfully
,
the
dollar
is
not
under
1987-style
pressure
.

Also
,
traders
are
in
better
shape
today
than
in
1987
to
survive
selling
binges
.

They
are
better
capitalized
.

They
are
in
less
danger
of
losing
liquidity
simply
because
of
tape
lags
and
clearing
and
settlement
delays
.

The
Fed
promises
any
needed
liquidity
.

The
Big
Board
's
liaison
with
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
has
improved
;
it
will
be
interesting
to
learn
if
``
circuit
breakers
''
prove
to
be
a
good
idea
.

In
any
event
,
some
traders
see
stocks
as
underpriced
today
,
unlike
1987
.

There
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
market
that
ca
n't
be
cured
by
a
little
coherence
and
common
sense
in
Washington
.

But
on
the
bearish
side
,
that
may
be
too
much
to
expect
.

First
Chicago
Corp.
posted
a
third-quarter
loss
of
$
23.3
million
after
joining
other
big
banks
in
further
adding
to
its
reserves
for
losses
on
foreign
loans
.

The
parent
company
of
First
National
Bank
of
Chicago
,
with
$
48
billion
in
assets
,
said
it
set
aside
$
200
million
to
absorb
losses
on
loans
and
investments
in
financially
troubled
countries
.

The
addition
,
on
top
of
two
big
1987
additions
to
foreign-loan
reserves
,
brings
the
reserve
to
a
level
equaling
79
%
of
medium-term
and
long-term
loans
outstanding
to
troubled
nations
.

First
Chicago
since
1987
has
reduced
its
loans
to
such
nations
to
$
1.7
billion
from
$
3
billion
.

Despite
this
loss
,
First
Chicago
said
it
does
n't
need
to
sell
stock
to
raise
capital
.

During
the
quarter
,
the
company
realized
a
pretax
gain
of
$
60.4
million
from
the
sale
of
its
First
Chicago
Investment
Advisors
unit
.

Combined
foreign
exchange
and
bond
trading
profits
dipped
24
%
against
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
to
$
38.2
million
from
$
50.5
million
.

Gains
from
First
Chicago
's
venture
capital
unit
,
a
big
leveraged
buy-out
investor
,
rose
32
%
to
$
34
million
from
$
25.7
million
a
year
ago
.

Interest
income
and
most
fee
income
was
strong
.

Greece
's
second
bout
of
general
elections
this
year
is
slated
for
Nov.
5
.

For
those
hoping
to
see
a
modicum
of
political
normalcy
restored
--
in
view
of
Greece
's
eight-year
misadventure
under
autocratic
pseudosocialism
and
subsequent
three-month
hitch
with
a
conservative-communist
coalition
government
--
there
is
but
one
bright
sign
:
The
scandals
still
encircling
former
Prime
Minister
Andreas
Papandreou
and
his
fallen
socialist
government
are
like
flies
buzzing
around
a
rotting
carcass
.

In
the
mid-June
round
of
voting
,
Greeks
gave
no
clear
mandate
to
any
single
political
party
.

The
ad
interim
coalition
government
that
emerged
from
post-electoral
hagglings
was
,
in
essence
,
little
more
than
the
ill-conceived
offspring
of
ideological
miscegenation
:
On
one
side
,
the
center-right
New
Democracy
Party
,
headed
by
Constantine
Mitsotakis
.

On
the
other
,
the
so-called
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
--
a
quaint
and
rather
deceptive
title
for
a
merger
of
the
pro-Soviet
Communist
Party
of
Greece
and
its
Euro-Communist
cousin
,
the
Hellenic
Left
.

The
unifying
bond
for
this
left-right
mismatch
was
plain
:
PASOK
(
Mr.
Papandreou
's
party
)
as
common
political
enemy
.

The
ostensible
goal
was
a
mop-up
of
government
corruption
,
purportedly
at
all
levels
,
but
the
main
marks
were
Mr.
Papandreou
and
his
closest
associates
.

In
point
of
fact
,
this
catharsis
was
overdue
by
decades
.

When
reduced
to
buzzword
status
in
ex
parte
pledges
,
however
,
the
notion
transmogrified
into
a
promised
assault
,
with
targets
primarily
for
political
gains
,
not
justice
.

With
regard
to
Greece
's
long-bubbling
bank-looting
scandal
,
Mr.
Papandreou
's
principal
accuser
remains
George
Koskotas
,
former
owner
of
the
Bank
of
Crete
and
self-confessed
embezzler
,
now
residing
in
a
jail
cell
in
Salem
,
Mass.
,
from
where
he
is
fighting
extradition
proceedings
that
would
return
him
to
Greece
.

Mr.
Koskotas
's
credibility
is
,
at
best
,
problematic
.

He
has
ample
motive
to
shift
the
blame
,
and
his
testimony
has
also
been
found
less
than
forthright
on
numerous
points
.

Nevertheless
,
the
New
Democracy
and
Communist
parties
herald
his
assertions
as
proof
of
PASOK
complicity
.

Among
unanswered
questions
are
whether
Mr.
Papandreou
received
$
23
million
of
stolen
Bank
of
Crete
funds
and
an
additional
$
734,000
in
bribes
,
as
contended
;
whether
the
prime
minister
ordered
state
agencies
to
deposit
some
$
57
million
in
Mr.
Koskotas
's
bank
and
then
skim
off
the
interest
;
and
,
what
PASOK
's
cut
was
from
the
$
210
million
Mr.
Koskotas
pinched
.

Two
former
ministers
were
so
heavily
implicated
in
the
Koskotas
affair
that
PASOK
members
of
Parliament
voted
to
refer
them
to
the
special
court
.

But
eluding
parliamentary
probe
was
the
case
of
millions
of
drachmas
Mr.
Koskotas
funneled
into
New
Democracy
coffers
.

In
the
end
,
the
investigation
produced
only
circumstantial
evidence
and
``
indications
''
that
point
to
PASOK
,
not
clinching
proof
.

On
another
issue
,
Greeks
were
told
how
their
national
intelligence
agency
,
the
EYP
,
regularly
monitored
the
telephone
conversations
of
prominent
figures
,
including
key
opposition
politicians
,
journalists
and
PASOK
cabinet
members
.

Despite
convincing
arguments
,
it
was
never
established
that
Mr.
Papandreou
personally
ordered
or
directed
the
wiretaps
.

The
central
weakness
of
the
``
scandals
''
debates
was
pointed
up
especially
well
when
discussions
focused
on
arms
deals
and
kickbacks
.

The
coalition
government
tried
to
show
that
PASOK
ministers
had
received
hefty
sums
for
OKing
the
purchase
of
F-16
Fighting
Falcon
and
Mirage
2000
combat
aircraft
,
produced
by
the
U.S.based
General
Dynamics
Corp.
and
France
's
Avions
Marcel
Dassault
,
respectively
.

Naturally
,
neither
General
Dynamics
nor
Dassault
could
be
expected
to
hamper
its
prospective
future
dealings
by
making
disclosures
of
sums
paid
(
or
not
)
to
various
Greek
officials
for
services
rendered
.

So
it
seems
that
Mr.
Mitsotakis
and
his
communist
chums
may
have
unwittingly
served
Mr.
Papandreou
a
moral
victory
on
a
platter
:
PASOK
,
whether
guilty
or
not
,
can
now
traipse
the
countryside
condemning
the
whole
affair
as
a
witch
hunt
at
Mr.
Papandreou
's
expense
.

But
while
verbal
high
jinks
alone
wo
n't
help
PASOK
regain
power
,
Mr.
Papandreou
should
never
be
underestimated
.

First
came
his
predictable
fusillade
:
He
charged
the
Coalition
of
the
Left
and
Progress
had
sold
out
its
leftist
tenets
by
collaborating
in
a
right-wing
plot
aimed
at
ousting
PASOK
and
thwarting
the
course
of
socialism
in
Greece
.

Then
,
to
buttress
his
credibility
with
the
left
,
he
enticed
some
smaller
leftist
parties
to
stand
for
election
under
the
PASOK
banner
.

Next
,
he
continued
to
court
the
communists
--
many
of
whom
feel
betrayed
by
the
left-right
coalition
's
birth
--
by
bringing
into
PASOK
a
well-respected
Communist
Party
candidate
.

For
balance
,
and
in
hopes
of
gaining
some
disaffected
centrist
votes
,
he
managed
to
attract
a
former
New
Democracy
Party
representative
and
known
political
enemy
of
Mr.
Mitsotakis
.

Thus
PASOK
heads
for
the
polls
not
only
with
diminished
scandal-stench
,
but
also
with
``
seals
of
approval
''
from
representatives
of
its
harshest
accusers
.

Crucial
as
these
elections
are
for
Greece
,
pressing
issues
of
state
are
getting
lost
in
the
shuffle
.

The
country
's
future
NATO
participation
remains
unsure
,
for
instance
.

Greece
also
must
revamp
major
pieces
of
legislation
in
preparation
for
the
1992
targets
of
heightened
Common
Market
cooperation
.

Greece
's
bilateral
relations
with
the
U.S.
need
attention
soon
as
well
.

For
one
,
the
current
accord
concerning
U.S.
military
bases
in
Greece
lapses
in
May
1990
.

Negotiations
for
a
new
agreement
were
frozen
before
the
June
elections
,
but
the
clock
is
running
.

Another
matter
of
concern
is
the
extradition
of
Mohammed
Rashid
,
a
Palestinian
terrorist
who
is
wanted
in
the
U.S.
for
the
1982
bombing
of
a
Pan
American
Airways
flight
.

The
Greek
courts
have
decided
in
favor
of
extradition
in
the
Rashid
case
,
but
the
matter
awaits
final
approval
from
Greece
's
next
justice
minister
.

The
Greeks
seem
barely
aware
of
the
importance
of
the
case
as
a
litmus
test
of
whether
Greece
will
be
counted
in
or
out
for
international
efforts
to
combat
terrorism
.

That
PASOK
could
win
the
elections
outright
is
improbable
;
the
Greek
press
,
previously
eager
to
palm
off
PASOK
's
line
,
has
turned
on
Mr.
Papandreou
with
a
wild-eyed
vengeance
.

Yet
the
possibility
of
another
lash-up
government
is
all
too
real
.

If
Mr.
Papandreou
becomes
the
major
opposition
leader
,
he
could
hamstring
a
conservative-led
coalition
.

Also
,
he
could
force
new
elections
early
next
year
by
frustrating
the
procedures
for
the
election
of
the
president
of
the
republic
in
March
.

New
Democracy
has
once
again
glaringly
underestimated
the
opponent
and
linked
its
own
prospects
to
negative
reaction
against
PASOK
,
forgetting
to
tend
to
either
program
clarity
or
the
rectification
of
internal
squabbles
.

As
for
Mr.
Papandreou
?
He
's
not
exactly
sitting
pretty
at
this
stage
.

But
since
he
is
undoubtedly
one
of
the
most
proficient
bull
slingers
who
ever
raked
muck
,
it
seems
far
wiser
to
view
him
as
sidelined
,
but
certainly
not
yet
eliminated
.

correspondent

National
Review

U.S.
OFFICIALS
MOVED
to
head
off
any
repeat
of
Black
Monday
today
following
Friday
's

in

prices

Fed

massive

of
money
into

to
prevent

crisis
.

Other
U.S.

officials
also
mapped
out
plans
,
though
they
kept
their
moves
quiet
to
avoid
making
the
financial
markets
more
jittery
.

Friday
's
sell-off
was
triggered
by
the
collapse
of
UAL

buy-out
plan

a
big
rise
in

prices
.

The

Prospects
for

bleak
.

Many
banks
refused
to
back
the
$
6.79
billion
transaction
,
but
bankers
said
it
was
not
from
any
unwillingness
to
finance
takeovers
.

The
decision
was
based
solely
on
problems
with
the
UAL
management-pilot
plan
,
they
said
.

The
surge
in
producer
prices
in
September
followed
three
months
of
declines
,
but
analysts
were
divided
on
whether
the
0.9
%
jump
signaled
a
severe
worsening
of
inflation
.

Also
,
retail
sales
grew
0.5
%
last

.

A

cut
this

A
federal
appeals
court
in
San
Francisco
ruled
that
shareholders
ca
n't
hold
corporate
officials
liable
for
false
sales
projections
on
new
products
if
the
news
media
concurrently
revealed
substantial
information
about
the
product
's
flaws
.

The
ruling
stems
from
a
1984
suit
filed
by
shareholders
of
Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
claiming
that
company
officials
misled
investors
about
the
expected
success
of
the
Lisa
computer
,
introduced
in
1983
.

Lawyers
specializing
in
shareholder
suits
said
they
are
concerned
that
use
of
the
``
press
defense
''
by
corporations
may
become
popular
as
a
result
of
the
ruling
.

According
to
the
suit
,
Apple
officials
created
public
excitement
by
touting
Lisa
as
an
office
computer
that
would
revolutionize
the
workplace
and
be
extremely
successful
in
its
first
year
.

The
plaintiffs
also
alleged
that
prior
to
the
fanfare
,
the
company
circulated
internal
memos
indicating
problems
with
Lisa
.

The
suit
claimed
Apple
's
stock
climbed
to
a
high
of
$
63.50
a
share
on
the
basis
of
the
company
's
optimistic
forecasts
.

But
when
the
company
revealed
Lisa
's
poor
sales
late
in
1983
,
the
stock
plummeted
to
a
low
of
$
17.37
a
share
,
according
to
the
suit
.

The
shareholders
claimed
more
than
$
150
million
in
losses
.

In
1987
,
the
San
Francisco
district
court
dismissed
the
case
largely
because
newspaper
reports
had
sufficiently
counterbalanced
the
company
's
statements
by
alerting
consumers
to
Lisa
's
problems
.

Late
last
month
,
the
appeals
court
agreed
that
most
of
the
case
should
be
dismissed
.

However
,
it
gave
the
shareholders
the
right
to
pursue
a
small
portion
of
their
claim
that
pertains
to
Lisa
's
disk
drive
,
known
as
Twiggy
.

The
court
ruled
that
the
news
media
did
n't
reveal
Twiggy
's
problems
at
the
time
.

Lawyers
are
worried
about
the
ruling
's
implication
in
other
shareholder
suits
but
pointed
out
that
the
court
stressed
that
the
ruling
should
be
regarded
as
very
specific
to
the
Apple
case
.

``
The
court
was
careful
to
say
that
the
adverse
information
appeared
in
the
very
same
articles
and
received
the
same
attention
as
the
company
's
statements
,
''
said
Patrick
Grannon
,
a
Los
Angeles
lawyer
at
the
firm
of
Greenfield
&
Chimicles
,
which
was
n't
involved
in
the
case
.

``
The
court
is
saying
that
the
adverse
facts
have
to
be
transferred
to
the
market
with
equal
intensity
and
credibility
as
the
statements
of
corporate
insiders
.

''
Shareholders
'
attorneys
at
the
New
York
firm
of
Milberg
,
Weiss
,
Bershad
,
Specthrie
&
Lerach
last
week
petitioned
for
a
rehearing
of
the
case
.

They
wrote
:
``
The
opinion
establishes
a
new
rule
of
immunity
--
that
if
a
wide
variety
of
opinions
on
a
company
's
business
are
publicly
reported
,
the
company
can
say
anything
without
fear
of
securities
liability

''
NFL
ORDERED
to
pay
$
5.5
million
in
legal
fees
to
defunct
The
National
Football
League
is
considering
appealing
the
ruling
stemming
from
the
U.S.
Football
League
's
largely
unsuccessful
antitrust
suit
against
the
NFL
.

A
jury
in
1986
agreed
with
the
USFL
's
claims
that
the
NFL
monopolized
major
league
football
.

But
the
jury
awarded
the
USFL
only
$
1
in
damages
,
trebled
because
of
the
antitrust
claims
.

Last
week
,
the
U.S.
Court
of
Appeals
in
New
York
upheld
a
$
5.5
million
award
of
attorneys
fees
to
the
defunct
league
.

Harvey
D.

Manley
,

Casey
,
was
the
lead
trial
lawyer
,
and
his
new
firm
pursued
the
application
appeal
.

Douglas
R.
Pappas
of
Myerson
&
Kuhn
says
about
$
5.3
million
of
the
award
goes
directly
to
the
USFL
to
reimburse
it
for
fees
already
paid
.

Myerson
&
Kuhn
will
get
about
$
260,000
for
the
costs
of
pressing
the
application
.

The
federal
appeals
court
held
that
the
nominal
damages
and
the
failure
to
prove
all
claims
did
n't
exclude
the
USFL
from
being
reimbursed
.

Antitrust
laws
provide
that
injured
parties
may
be
reimbursed
for
lawyers
'
fees
.

But
Shepard
Goldfein
,
an
attorney
for
the
NFL
,
says
his
client
will
consider
asking
for
another
hearing
or
appealing
to
the
U.S.
Supreme
Court
.

Mr.
Goldfein
,
of
Skadden
,
Arps
,
Slate
,
Meagher
&
Flom
in
New
York
,
says
the
ruling
is
wrong
and
the
fee
award
is
excessive
because
the
USFL
lost
its
major
claims
,
including
its
contention
that
the
NFL
restrained
trade
through
television
contracts
.

``
The
USFL
was
not
the
prevailing
party
,
''
Mr.
Goldfein
insists

HOUSTON-CALGARY
ALLIANCE
:
Fulbright

Jaworski
of
Houston

Fenerty
,
Robertson
,
Fraser
&
Hatch
of
Calgary
,
Alberta
,
are
affiliating
to
help
serve
their
energy-industry
clients
.

The
affiliation
is
believed
to
be
the
first
such
cross-border
arrangement
among
major
law
firms
.

The
firms
are
n't
required
to
refer
work
exclusively
to
each
other
and
remain
separate
organizations
.

But
they
will
work
together
on
energy
-
,
environmental
-
and
fair-trade-related
issues
and
conduct
seminars
on
topics
of
mutual
interest
,
said
Gibson
Gayle

of
585-lawyer
Fulbright

Jaworski
.

In
addition
,
Fulbright

Jaworski
's
Washington

office
will
play
a
key
role
as
the
firms
work
together
on
regulatory
issues
,
particularly
natural-gas
exports
,
for
their
clients
.

The
arrangement
,
reached
after
about
eight
months
of
negotiations
,
grew
out
of
80-lawyer
Fenerty
Robertson
's
desire
to
develop
ties
with
a
U.S.
firm
in
light
of
relaxed
trade
barriers
between
the
U.S.
and
Canada
,

Saville
of
Fenerty
Robertson
.

IN
WHAT
MAY
SIGNAL
a
turnaround
for
asbestos
manufacturers
,
W.R.
Grace
&
Co.
won
a
3
trial
in
Pittsburgh
over
whether
it
should
be
required
to
remove
asbestos
fireproofing
from
a
local
high
school
.

Mount
Lebanon
High
School
,
near
Pittsburgh
,
sought
$
21
million
in
compensatory
damages
from
Grace
,
arguing
that
the
asbestos
,
which
can
cause
respiratory
diseases
and
lung
cancer
,
posed
a
risk
to
students
.

Grace
successfully
contended
that
removing
the
fire
retardant
would
pose
a
greater
health
risk
than
leaving
it
alone
.

A
spokesman
for
the
company
said
the
verdict
is
thought
to
be
the
first
in
favor
of
an
asbestos
manufacturer
where
the
plaintiff
was
a
school
and
the
asbestos
in
question
was
used
for
fireproofing

Roger
Rosenblatt
,
editor

World

,
resigned
Friday
from
the
weekly

Mr.
Rosenblatt
said
he
resigned
because
of
difficulties
with
commuting
between
his
home
in
New

's
editorial
offices
in
Washington

circulation
have
grown
significantly

at
2.3

still
ranks
third
behind
Time

.

The
French
aircraft
group
pointed
out
,
however
,
that
financial
results
from

down
about
12

it

it
expects

billings
for
two
large
contracts
in
the
second
half
of
the
year
.

For
all
of
1988
,
Dassault
had
group
profit
of
428
million
francs
on
revenue
of
18.819
billion
francs
.

The
group
has
n't
yet
released
earnings
figures
for
the
first
half
of
1989
,
nor
has
it
made
a
detailed
forecast
of
its
full-year
earnings
.

Keystone
Consolidated
Industries
Inc.
expects
to
report
earnings
before
extraordinary
tax
benefits
of
about
$
1.5
million
,
or
about
41
cents
a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
,
compared
with
a
loss
last
year
,
said
Glenn
R.
Simmons
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

After
a
tax
benefit
of
about
$
780,000
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
2.3
million
,
or
about
62
cents
a
share
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

For
third
quarter
last
year
,
Keystone
reported
a
$
1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
200,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
,
for
a
net
loss
of
$
1.2
million
.

Revenue
for
the
latest
third
quarter
was
about
$
70.5
million
,
up
10
%
from
$
63.6
million
last
year
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
the
results
signal
a
turnaround
for
the
maker
of
wire
and
wire
products
,
which
has
struggled
to
remain
competitive
in
the
face
of
lower-priced
,
imported
steel
.

A
new
$
46
million
steel
rod
minimill
,
which
got
off
to
a
rocky
start
in
early
1988
,
now
is
running
efficiently
and
a
new
management
team
is
more
heavily
marketing
Keystone
's
products
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

As
a
result
,
the
company
hopes
to
report
net
income
for
the
year
of
about
$
11.6
million
,
or
about
$
3.10
to
$
3.15
a
share
,
compared
with
a
net
loss
of
$
24.4
million
last
year
,
after
a
loss
from
discontinued
operations
of
$
18.4
million
.

Revenue
for
1989
is
expected
to
be
about
$
300
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
247.3
million
in
1988
.

For
the
nine
months
ended
Sept.
30
,
Keystone
expects
to
report
net
income
of
$
9.3
milion
,
or
about
$
2.53
a
share
,
after
an
extraordinary
gain
from
$
3.2
million
in
tax
benefits
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
a
net
loss
of
$
6.5
million
,
including
a
$
6.1
million
loss
from
continuing
operations
and
a
$
400,000
loss
from
discontinued
operations
.

Revenue
for
the
nine
months
is
expected
to
be
about
$
230.5
million
,
up
about
21
%
from
$
190.4
million
last
year
.

Mr.
Simmons
said
Keystone
's
new
mill
is
expected
to
produce
about
585,000
tons
of
steel
rods
this
year
,
up
from
413,000
tons
in
1988
.

Production
at
the
mill
has
exceeded
the
ability
of
Keystone
's
casting
operation
to
supply
it
,
he
said
,
which
will
force
Keystone
to
purchase
billet
,
or
unfinished
steel
bars
,
from
outside
the
company
during
the
fourth
quarter
and
next
year
.

Keystone
will
have
to
consider
expanding
its
casting
operation
,
at
an
estimated
cost
of
$
8
million
to
$
10
million
,
within
the
next
18
to
24
months
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Under
Robert
W.
Singer
,
who
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
last
year
,
Keystone
has
expanded
its
sales
force
to
about
20
people
from
about
15
and
hopes
to
expand
its
sales
from
the
middle
portion
of
the
country
toward
the
East
and
West
coasts
.

``
Prior
to
a
year
ago
,
Keystone
was
an
order-taker
.

Now
I
think
we
have
a
group
of
marketing
people
who
are
out
selling
to
retailers
and
wholesalers
,
''
Mr.
Simmons
said
.

Still
,
he
said
,
the
100-year-old
company
plans
to
continue
its
premium-priced
strategy
for
its
distinctive
brand
of
red-tipped
wire
fencing
and
other
products
.

The
company
claims
a
40
%
share
of
the
U.S.
field
fence
business
,
a
35
%
share
of
poultry
netting
sales
and
a
30
%
share
of
barbed
wire
sales
.

Freeport-McMoRan
Inc.
said
a
temporary
cessation
of
operations
at
its
Sunshine
Bridge
uranium-recovery
facility
in
Donaldsonville
,
La.
,
will
result
in
slight
earnings
improvement
to
both
the
company
and
its
Freeport-McMoRan
Resource
Partners
Limited
Partnership
unit
.

The
company
did
n't
elaborate
.

The
diversified
energy
and
minerals
concern
said
that
a
depressed
uranium
market
is
responsible
for
the
temporary
mothballing
of
the
plant
,
but
that
the
plant
can
be
reactivated
quickly
when
the
market
improves
.

More
than
400,000
pounds
of
uranium
a
year
have
been
produced
at
the
facility
during
the
past
seven
years
.

A
second
uranium-recovery
plant
at
Uncle
Sam
,
La.
,
that
produces
more
than
700,000
pounds
of
uranium
annually
,
will
continue
to
operate
.

Freeport-McMoRan
said
the
shutdown
wo
n't
affect
sales
volumes
under
long-term
sales
contracts
of
its
Freeport
Uranium
Recovery
Co.
unit
,
but
will
reduce
the
amount
of
product
sold
on
the
spot
market
.

Freeport-McMoRan
Resource
Partners
,
as
owner
of
the
uranium-recovery
technology
,
receives
royalty
payments
.

Business
Week
subscribers
may
hear
this
week
's
issue
talking
back
to
them
.

A
four-page
ad
from
Texas
Instruments
Inc.
,
running
in
approximately
140,000
issues
of
the
Oct.
20
``
Corporate
Elite
''
issue
of
the
McGraw-Hill
Inc.
publication
,
contains
a
speech
synthesizer
laminated
between
two
of
the
pages
.

Readers
who
pull
off
a
piece
of
tape
and
press
a
switch
will
hear
a
tiny
--
but
distinctly
human-sounding
--
voice
announce
,
``
I
am
the
talking
chip
,
''
as
it
launches
into
a
15-second
discourse
on
its
own
attributes
.

The
talking
chip
is
n't
cheap
--
the
per-ad
cost
to
Texas
Instruments
is
about
$
4
,
and
that
's
without
adding
in
Business
Week
's
charge
--
but
Texas
Instruments
believes
it
is
a
first
.

Previous
efforts
have
included
musical
ads
,
featuring
simple
tone-generating
chips
that
play
a
tune
,
but
the
voice
synthesizer
in
this
effort
is
much
more
sophisticated
,
with
none
of
the
robotic
flatness
that
one
hears
,
for
example
,
when
calling
telephone
directory
services
.

And
for
those
who
miss
the
message
the
first
time
around
,
not
to
worry
:
Three
tiny
batteries
provide
enough
juice

Lomas
Financial
Corp.
,
Dallas
,
said
it
will
ask
a
U.S.
bankruptcy
court
to
allow
it
to
hire
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
to
help
it
sell
its
leasing
unit
.

Lomas
,
assisted
by
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
has
been
trying
to
sell
its
Equitable
Lomas
Leasing
Co.
for
several
months
,
apparently
without
success
.

The
real
estate
and
mortgage
banking
concern
had
hoped
to
use
proceeds
from
the
sale
to
reduce
its
debt
.

Without
cash
from
asset
sales
and
unable
to
reach
a
new
bank-credit
agreement
,
Lomas
defaulted
on
$
145
million
in
notes
that
became
due
Sept.
1
.

It
filed
for
protection
from
creditors
under
Chapter
11
of
the
federal
Bankruptcy
Code
Sept.
24
to
give
it
additional
time
to
work
on
a
plan
to
restructure
its
$
1.45
billion
in
senior
debt
.

Lomas
said
Merrill
Lynch
,
which
owns
bonds
and
equity
in
Lomas
,
could
n't
continue
as
Lomas
's
investment
banker
because
it
is
also
a
creditor
.

It
said
it
chose
Lazard
in
part
because
of
Lazard
's
offices
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
where
investors
might
be
interested
in
a
U.S.
leasing
company
.

Canadian
Imperial
Bank
of
Commerce
said
it
will
increase
its
loan-loss
provisions
to
cover
all
its
loans
to
lesser
developed
countries
,
except
Mexico
,
resulting
in
an
after-tax
charge
to
1989
earnings
of
300
million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$
255
million
)
.

Don
Bowder
,
senior
vice
president
and
chief
accountant
,
said
the
bank
's
strong
earnings
enable
it
to
be
the
first
major
Canadian
bank
to
set
aside
provisions
covering
all
its
C$
1.17
billion
in
non-Mexican
LDC
debt
.

``
It
eliminates
the
continuing
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
ultimate
value
of
the
loans
,
''
he
said
.

The
bank
said
about
C$
525
million
will
be
added
to
its
existing
LDC
and
general
loss
provisions
in
its
fourth
quarter
,
ending
Oct.
31
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
C$
300
million
charge
to
earnings
would
amount
to
about
C$
1.34
a
share
.

The
bank
's
net
income
for
the
nine
months
ended
July
31
was
C$
577
million
,
or
C$
3.10
a
share
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
will
restructure
its
C$
604
million
of
Mexican
debt
,
of
which
C$
255
million
is
in
Mexican
notes
secured
by
U.S.
government
bonds
.

The
bank
has
a
45
%
reserve
against
the
remaining
C$
349
million
of
Mexican
debt
and
expects
to
swap
that
for
other
Mexican
notes
supported
by
U.S.
Treasury
zero-coupon
bonds
.

Mr.
Bowder
said
the
bank
's
experience
with
LDC
debt
has
been
``
painful
''
and
this
latest
move
represents
the
final
phase
of
a
program
begun
seven
years
ago
to
reduce
its
exposure
through
provisioning
,
debt
sales
and
debt
swaps
.

He
said
the
bank
will
no
longer
participate
in
LDC
sovereign
lending
,
but
will
support
trade
financing
and
other
transactions
that
meet
the
bank
's
standards
.

The
carnage
among
takeover
stocks
Friday
does
n't
mean
the
end
of
mega-mergers
but
simply
marks
the
start
of
a
less
ambitious
game
,
Wall
Street
's
big-time
deal
makers
say
.

Suitors
from
now
on
are
more
likely
to
be
expansion-minded
companies
,
rather
than
raiders
or
debt-happy
financiers
.

And
they
will
be
launching
lower-priced
and
perhaps
fewer
deals
,
now
that
it
's
tougher
to
finance
them
.

This
is
an
ominous
sign
for
a
stock
market
that
lately
has
been
fueled
by
takeover
speculation
and
bidding
wars
for
companies
that
put
themselves
up
for
sale
.

Whenever
the
1980s
merger
boom
seems
to
be
stalling
,
shock
waves
ripple
through
the
stock
market
.

``
The
market
is
overvalued
,
not
cheap
,
''
says
Alan
Gaines
of
the
New
York
money-management
firm
Gaines
Berland
.

He
recently
began
increasing
his
cash
position
to
45
%
of
his
portfolio
.

``
I
look
at
where
deals
can
get
done
,
''
he
says
,
``
and
they
're
not
getting
done
''
at
current
prices
.

Lenders
are
growing
increasingly
nervous
about
debt-financed
takeovers
,
investment
bankers
say
.

``
You
had
a
week
of
a
deteriorating
junk-bond
market
that
ran
smack
into
the
news
on
Friday
about
what
appeared
to
be
happening
to
the
bank
debt
market
,
''
says
Steven
Rattner
,
a
partner
and
merger
specialist
with
Lazard
Freres
&
Co
.

Trading
dried
up
Friday
in
the
market
for
high-yield
junk
bonds
,
often
used
to
finance
takeovers
.

It
was
the
latest
in
a
series
of
setbacks
for
the
junk
bond
market
,
where
prices
began
weakening
last
month
after
Campeau
hit
a
cash
crunch
.

And
banks
appear
to
be
taking
an
increasingly
skeptical
view
of
requests
for
high-risk
takeover
loans
.

The
group
trying
to
buy
UAL
announced
Friday
that
it
could
n't
arrange
the
$
7.2
billion
in
bank
loans
it
needs
to
buy
the
parent
of
United
Airlines
for
$
300
a
share
.

Takeover-stock
traders
today
will
be
scrambling
to
learn
of
any
UAL
developments
,
and
other
takeover
stocks
are
likely
to
trade
in
sympathy
.

Investment
bankers
representing
the
buy-out
group
and
UAL
's
board
spent
a
frantic
weekend
trying
to
hammer
out
new
terms
that
would
be
more
acceptable
to
the
banks
.

After
UAL
,
the
stock
viewed
as
most
vulnerable
is
American
Airlines
'
parent
AMR
,
the
target
of
a
$
120-a-share
takeover
proposal
from
New
York
real
estate
developer
Donald
Trump
.

Trading
in
AMR
shares
was
suspended
shortly
after
3
p.m.
EDT
Friday
and
did
n't
resume
.

Before
the
halt
,
AMR
last
traded
at
98
.

Late
Friday
night
,
the
London
office
of
Jefferies
&
Co.
,
a
Los
Angeles
securities
firm
,
traded
AMR
shares
at
prices
as
low
as
80
.

Similarly
,
Delta
Air
Lines
and
USAir
Group
dropped
10.1
%
and
8.5
%
,
respectively
,
on
Friday
and
could
weaken
further
.

Over
the
weeked
,
however
,
two
developments
in
other
deals
indicated
that
commerical
banks
and
Wall
Street
firms
still
are
willing
to
commit
billions
of
dollars
to
finance
takeover
bids
launched
by
major
companies
.

Vitro
S.A.
,
a
major
Mexican
glass
maker
,
said
yesterday
that
it
agreed
to
buy
Anchor
Glass
Container
in
a
tender
offer
for
$
21.25
a
share
,
sweetened
from
the
original
$
20-a-share
offer
Vitro
launched
two
months
ago
.

On
Friday
,
Anchor
shares
fell
1
to
close
at
18
.

For
the
broader
market
,
the
greatest
significance
of
the
Vitro-Anchor
deal
may
be
that
it
was
put
together
late
Friday
night
--
after
the
market
rout
--
and
involves
a
$
155
million
temporary
``
bridge
''
loan
from
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
and
a
$
139
million
loan
from
Security
Pacific
National
Bank
.

Moreover
,
to
complete
the
entire
Anchor
Glass
purchase
and
refinance
existing
debt
,
Donaldson
said
it
is
``
highly
confident
''
that
it
will
be
able
to
sell
$
400
million
of
junk
bonds
for
Vitro
,
despite
the
current
disarray
in
the
junk
bond
market
.

Donaldson
's
statement
is
n't
merely
an
idle
boast
,
because
those
bonds
will
have
to
be
sold
before
Donaldson
's
bridge
loan
can
be
paid
back
.

Security
Pacific
,
meanwhile
,
said
it
expects
to
arrange
$
430
million
in
bank
loans
for
Vitro
.

In
another
takeover
battle
,
a
spokesman
for
McCaw
Cellular
Communications
said
yesterday
that
McCaw
has
been
advised
by
three
commercial
banks
that
they
remain
``
highly
confident
''
they
can
arrange
$
4.5
billion
of
bank
loans
for
McCaw
's
tender
offer
for
about
45
%
of
LIN
Broadcasting
,
``
notwithstanding
recent
events
.

''
McCaw
is
offering
$
125
a
share
for
22
million
LIN
shares
,
thereby
challenging
LIN
's
proposal
to
spin
off
its
television
properties
,
pay
shareholders
a
$
20-a-share
special
dividend
and
combine
its
cellular-telephone
operations
with
BellSouth
's
cellular
business
.

On
Friday
,
LIN
shares
were
among
the
few
takeover
issues
that
did
n't
fall
much
,
dropping
5
,
or
4.9
%
,
to
close
at
107
.

Traders
and
investment
bankers
said
LIN
shares
were
n't
hurt
much
because
BellSouth
is
viewed
as
a
well-financed
corporate
buyer
unlikely
to
be
affected
by
skittishness
among
bankers
or
bond
buyers
.

Investment
bankers
interviewed
over
the
weekend
see
a
silver
lining
for
the
merger
business
in
the
stock-market
drop
.

Potential
bidders
for
companies
``
were
saying
that
things
were
beginning
to
look
expensive
,
''
says
Mr.
Rattner
of
Lazard

``
Nothing
makes
things
look
cheaper
than
a
200-point
drop
in
the
Dow
,
''
Mr.
Rattner
says
.

``
Just
as
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
stock
market
,
there
are
people
waiting
to
become
bargain
hunters
in
the
deal
market
.

''
Investment
bankers
expect
most
of
those
bargain
hunters
to
be
well-heeled
corporations
.

``
In
the
past
,
corporate
buyers
were
often
discouraged
from
making
bids
because
of
competition
from
LBO
firms
,
which
were
often
prepared
to
outbid
''
the
corporations
,
says
J.
Tomilson
Hill
,
head
of
mergers
and
acquisitions
at
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Now
,
``
corporate
buyers
should
be
willing
to
re-enter
the
acquisition
market
because
the
competition
from
junkbond-financed
buyers
has
been
reduced
.

''
Many
takeover
stocks
plunged
Friday
,
as
speculators
retained
their
confidence
in
corporate
buyers
but
fled
from
the
socalled
whisper
stocks
,
the
targets
of
rumored
deals
.

Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
,
which
has
agreed
to
a
friendly
$
27-a-share
bid
from
Sony
of
Japan
,
fell
only
to
close
at
26
.

But
several
stocks
long
rumored
to
be
ripe
for
a
takeover
or
restructuring
fell
10
%
or
more
.

They
include
USX
,
down
11.7
%
;
Upjohn
,
down
11.1
%
;
Campbell
Soup
,
down
11
%
;
Paramount
Communications
,
off
10.3
%
;
Woolworth
,
down
10.2
%
;
Delta
Air
Lines
,
down
10.1
%
,
and
MCA
,
down
9.7
%
.

The
market
--
and
investment
bankers
--
are
even
less
sanguine
about
companies
that
have
had
at
least
one
bid
,
merger
agreement
or
restructuring
plan
fall
through
already
.

Given
the
weakness
in
both
the
junk
bond
market
and
the
stock
market
,
traders
fear
that
these
transactions
may
be
revised
yet
again
.

Examples
include
Kollmorgen
,
whose
agreement
to
be
acquired
for
$
25
a
share
by
Vernitron
collapsed
last
month
.

Kollmorgen
shares
fell
nearly
20
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
12
.

Ramada
,
which
first
delayed
and
then
shelved
a
$
400
million
junk
bond
sale
that
was
designed
to
help
finance
a
restructuring
,
fell
15.6
%
to
close
at
9
.

Ramada
has
said
it
hopes
to
propose
a
new
restructuring
plan
but
has
n't
indicated
when
it
will
do
so
.

Shares
of
American
Medical
International
,
which
agreed
last
week
to
accept
a
lower
price
from
a
buy-out
group
that
includes
First
Boston
Corp.
and
the
Pritzker
family
of
Chicago
,
fell
15.8
%
on
Friday
to
close
at
20
.

The
buy-out
group
is
offering
$
26.50
a
share
for
63
million
American
Medical
shares
,
down
from
its
offer
in
July
of
$
28
a
share
for
68.8
million
shares
.

But
investment
bankers
say
the
market
may
have
oversold
some
takeover-related
stocks
.

Hilton
Hotels
,
for
example
,
was
among
the
worst-hit
issues
,
falling
20.2
%
to
close
at
85
,
down
21
on
Friday
.

Hilton
currently
is
soliciting
bids
for
a
sale
of
part
or
all
of
its
hotel
and
casino
businesses
.

People
familiar
with
Hilton
said
over
the
weekend
that
the
depth
of
the
sell-off
in
Hilton
shares
was
unwarranted
because
none
of
the
likely
buyers
would
be
dependent
on
junk-bond
financing
.

However
,
they
conceded
that
some
potential
bidders
would
rely
on
bank
loans
and
would
be
hurt
if
the
troubles
of
the
UAL
buy-out
group
signified
a
general
unwillingness
among
banks
to
provide
credit
for
debt-financed
takeovers
.

Hilton
officials
said
they
were
n't
worried
about
the
drop
in
the
company
's
stock
.

William
Lebo
,
Hilton
's
general
counsel
,
said
plans
to
consider
a
sale
of
the
company
or
some
of
its
assets
are
``
on
track
''
for
what
has
been
described
previously
as
``
a
slow
and
deliberate
process
.

''
``
I
ca
n't
believe
that
any
potential
buyer
for
Hilton
would
be
affected
by
one
day
's
trading
,
''
Mr.
Lebo
said
.

But
the
stock
market
as
a
whole
,
bolstered
as
it
is
by
takeover
speculation
,
remains
vulnerable
to
any
further
pullback
by
takeover
financiers
,
both
in
the
junkbond
market
and
among
commercial
banks
.

For
debt-ridden
suitors
,
``
the
takeover
game
has
been
over
for
some
time
,
''
says
New
York
money
manager
Neil
Weisman
of
Chilmark
Capital
,
who
has
been
keeping
85
%
of
his
portfolio
in
cash
.

``
The
market
is
just
waking
up
to
that
point
.

Pauline
Yoshihashi

Los

contributed

column

Of
all
the
one-time
expenses
incurred
by
a
corporation
or
professional
firm
,
few
are
larger
or
longer
term
than
the
purchase
of
real
estate
or
the
signing
of
a
commercial
lease
.

To
take
full
advantage
of
the
financial
opportunities
in
this
commitment
,
however
,
the
corporation
or
professional
firm
must
do
more
than
negotiate
the
best
purchase
price
or
lease
terms
.

It
must
also
evaluate
the
real-estate
market
in
the
chosen
location
from
a
new
perspective
.

Specifically
,
it
must
understand
how
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
shifts
in
regional
economies
and
then
take
advantage
of
these
opportunities
.

When
a
regional
economy
catches
cold
,
the
local
real-estate
market
gets
pneumonia
.

In
other
words
,
real-estate
market
indicators
,
such
as
building
permits
and
leasing
activity
,
plummet
much
further
than
a
local
economy
in
recession
.

This
was
seen
in
the
late
1960s
in
Los
Angeles
and
the
mid-1970s
in
New
York
.

But
the
reverse
is
also
true
:
When
a
region
's
economy
rebounds
from
a
slowdown
,
these
real-estate
indicators
will
rebound
far
faster
than
the
improving
economy
.

Why
do
local
real-estate
markets
overreact
to
regional
economic
cycles
?
Because
real-estate
purchases
and
leases
are
such
major
long-term
commitments
that
most
companies
and
individuals
make
these
decisions
only
when
confident
of
future
economic
stability
and
growth
.

Metropolitan
Detroit
was
written
off
economically
during
the
early
1980s
,
as
the
domestic
auto
industry
suffered
a
serious
sales
depression
and
adjustment
.

Area
employment
dropped
by
13
%
from
its
1979
peak
and
retail
sales
were
down
14
%
.

However
,
the
real-estate
market
was
hurt
even
more
.

For
example
,
residential
building
permits
in
the
trough
year
of
1982
were
off
76
%
from
the
1979
peak
level
.

Once
metropolitan
Detroit
's
economy
rallied
in
the
mid-1980s
,
real
estate
rebounded
.

Building
permits
,
for
example
,
soared
a
staggering
400
%
between
1982
and
the
peak
year
of
1986
.

Where
,
savvy
corporations
and
professional
firms
are
now
asking
,
are
today
's
opportunities
?
Look
no
further
than
metropolitan
Houston
and
Denver
,
two
of
the
most
depressed
,
overbuilt
and
potentially
undervalued
real-estate
markets
in
the
nation
.

Of
course
,
some
observers
have
touted
Houston
and
Denver
for
the
past
five
years
as
a
counter-cyclical
play
.

But
now
appears
to
be
the
time
to
act
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
economy
did
drop
and
then
flatten
in
the
years
after
its
1982
peak
.

In
the
mid-1980s
,
employment
was
down
as
much
as
5
%
from
the
1982
peak
and
retail
sales
were
off
13
%
.

The
real-estate
market
suffered
even
more
severe
setbacks
.

Office
construction
dropped
97
%
.

The
vacancy
rate
soared
more
than
20
%
in
nearly
every
product
category
,
and
more
than
30
%
of
office
space
was
vacant
.

To
some
observers
,
the
empty
office
buildings
of
Houston
's
``
see-through
skyline
''
were
indicative
of
a
very
troubled
economy
.

As
usual
,
the
real-estate
market
had
overreacted
.

Actually
,
the
region
's
economy
retained
a
firm
foundation
.

Metropolitan
Houston
's
population
has
held
steady
over
the
past
six
years
.

And
personal
income
,
after
slumping
in
the
mid-1980s
,
has
returned
to
its
1982
level
in
real
dollar
terms
.

Today
,
metropolitan
Houston
's
real-estate
market
is
poised
for
a
significant
turnaround
.

More
than
42,000
jobs
were
added
in
metro
Houston
last
year
,
primarily
in
biotechnology
,
petrochemical
processing
,
and
the
computer
industry
.

This
growth
puts
Houston
in
the
top
five
metro
areas
in
the
nation
last
year
.

And
forecasts
project
a
2.5
%
to
3
%
growth
rate
in
jobs
over
the
next
few
years
--
nearly
twice
the
national
average
.

Denver
is
another
metropolitan
area
where
the
commercial
real-estate
market
has
overreacted
to
the
region
's
economic
trends
,
although
Denver
has
not
experienced
as
severe
an
economic
downturn
as
Houston
.

By
some
measures
,
metropolitan
Denver
's
economy
has
actually
improved
in
the
past
four
years
.

Its
population
has
continued
to
increase
since
1983
,
the
peak
year
of
the
economic
cycle
.

Employment
is
now
4
%
higher
than
in
1983
.

Buying
income
in
real
dollars
actually
increased
15
%
between
1983
and
1987
(
the
most
recent
year
available
)
.

The
rates
of
increase
,
however
,
are
less
than
the
rapid
growth
of
the
boom
years
,
and
this
has
resulted
in
a
loss
of
confidence
in
the
economy
.

In
a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
,
therefore
,
the
region
's
real-estate
market
all
but
collapsed
in
recent
years
.

Housing
building
permits
are
down
more
than
75
%
from
their
1983
peaks
.

Although
no
one
can
predict
when
metropolitan
Denver
's
real-estate
market
will
rebound
,
major
public
works
projects
costing
several
billion
dollars
are
under
way
or
planned
--
such
as
a
new
convention
center
,
a
major
beltway
encircling
the
metropolitan
area
,
and
a
new
regional
airport
.

When
Denver
's
regional
economy
begins
to
grow
faster
--
such
a
recovery
could
occur
as
early
as
next
year
--
business
and
consumer
confidence
will
return
,
and
the
resulting
explosion
of
real-estate
activity
will
dwarf
the
general
economic
rebound
.

What
real-estate
strategy
should
one
follow
in
a
metropolitan
area
whose
economic
health
is
not
as
easy
to
determine
as
Houston
's
or
Denver
's
?
Generally
,
overcapacity
in
commercial
real
estate
is
dropping
from
its
mid-1980s
peak
,
even
in
such
economically
healthy
metropolitan
areas
as
Washington
,
New
York
and
Los
Angeles
.

Vacancy
rates
in
the
15
%
to
19
%
range
today
may
easily
rise
to
the
low
to
mid-20
%
range
in
a
couple
of
years
.

Under
these
conditions
,
even
a
flattening
out
of
economic
growth
--
``
catching
cold
''
--
in
the
healthy
metropolitan
areas
will
create
significant
opportunities
for
corporations
and
professional
service
firms
looking
for
bargains
as
the
realestate
industry
catches
pneumonia
.

Those
looking
for
real-estate
bargains
in
distressed
metropolitan
areas
should
lock
in
leases
or
buy
now
;
those
looking
in
healthy
metropolitan
areas
should
take
a
short-term
(
three-year
)
lease
and
wait
for
the
bargains
ahead
.

Mr.
Leinberger
is
managing
partner
of
a
real-estate
advisory
firm
based
in
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif
.

Kysor
Industrial
Corp.
said
it
expects
its
third-quarter
net
earnings
to
be
between
two
cents
and
four
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
61
cents
a
share
a
year
ago
.

Analysts
had
been
projecting
that
the
company
's
earnings
would
be
between
25
cents
and
30
cents
a
share
.

The
year-earlier
third-quarter
earnings
amounted
to
$
4.1
million
.

The
company
said
a
drop
in
activity
in
the
powerboat
industry
reduced
sales
volume
at
its
two
marine-related
operations
.

Also
,
the
company
said
its
commercial
products
operation
failed
to
meet
forecasts
.

Kysor
,
a
maker
of
heavy-duty
truck
and
commercial
refrigeration
equipment
,
said
it
expects
its
fourth-quarter
earnings
to
be
more
closely
in
line
with
usual
levels
,
which
are
between
30
cents
and
50
cents
a
share
.

Common
Cause
asked
both
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
and
the
Justice
Department
to
investigate
$
1
million
in
political
gifts
by
Arizona
businessman
Charles
Keating
to
five
U.S.
senators
who
interceded
with
thrift-industry
regulators
for
him
.

Mr.
Keating
is
currently
the
subject
of
a
$
1.1
billion
federal
anti-racketeering
lawsuit
accusing
him
of
bleeding
off
assets
of
a
California
thrift
he
controlled
,
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
,
and
driving
it
into
insolvency
.

Fred
Wertheimer
--
president
of
Common
Cause
,
the
self-styled
citizens
lobby
--
said
Mr.
Keating
already
has
conceded
attempting
to
buy
influence
with
the
lawmakers
--
Democratic
Sens.
Dennis
DeConcini
of
Arizona
,
Alan
Cranston
of
California
,
John
Glenn
of
Ohio
and
Donald
Riegle
of
Michigan
;
and
GOP
Sen.
John
McCain
of
Arizona
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
based
this
on
a
statement
by
Mr.
Keating
that
was
quoted
in
a
Wall
Street
Journal
story
in
April
:
``
One
question
...
had
to
do
with
whether
my
financial
support
in
any
way
influenced
several
political
figures
to
take
up
my
cause
.

I
want
to
say
in
the
most
forceful
way
I
can
:
I
certainly
hope
so
.

''
In
a
highly
unusual
meeting
in
Sen.
DeConcini
's
office
in
April
1987
,
the
five
senators
asked
federal
regulators
to
ease
up
on
Lincoln
.

According
to
notes
taken
by
one
of
the
participants
at
the
meeting
,
the
regulators
said
Lincoln
was
gambling
dangerously
with
depositors
'
federally
insured
money
and
was
``
a
ticking
time
bomb
.

''
Mr.
Keating
had
complained
that
the
regulators
were
being
too
zealous
.

The
notes
show
that
Sen.
DeConcini
called
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Bank
Board
's
regulations
``
grossly
unfair
,
''
and
that
Sen.
Glenn
insisted
that
Mr.
Keating
's
thrift
was
``
viable
and
profitable
.

''
For
the
next
two
years
,
the
Bank
Board
,
which
at
the
time
was
the
agency
responsible
for
regulating
thrifts
,
failed
to
act
--
even
after
federal
auditors
warned
in
May
1987
that
Mr.
Keating
had
caused
Lincoln
to
become
insolvent
.

Lincoln
's
parent
company
,
American
Continental
Corp.
,
entered
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
this
April
13
,
and
regulators
seized
the
thrift
the
next
day
.

The
newly
formed
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
successor
to
the
Bank
Board
,
filed
suit
against
Mr.
Keating
and
several
others
on
Sept.
15
.

Mr.
Keating
has
filed
his
own
suit
,
alleging
that
his
property
was
taken
illegally
.

The
cost
to
taxpayers
of
Lincoln
's
collapse
has
been
estimated
at
as
much
as
$
2.5
billion
.

Details
of
the
affair
have
become
public
gradually
over
the
past
two
years
,
mostly
as
a
result
of
reporting
by
several
newspapers
.

In
the
midst
of
his
1988
re-election
campaign
,
Sen.
Riegle
,
chairman
of
the
Senate
Banking
Committee
,
returned
$
76,000
in
contributions
after
a
Detroit
newspaper
said
that
Mr.
Keating
had
gathered
the
money
for
him
about
two
weeks
before
the
meeting
with
regulators
.

Sen.
DeConcini
,
after
months
of
fending
off
intense
press
criticism
,
returned
$
48,000
only
last
month
,
shortly
after
the
government
formally
accused
Mr.
Keating
of
defrauding
Lincoln
.

In
addition
,
Sen.
McCain
last
week
disclosed
that
he
belatedly
had
paid
$
13,433
to
American
Continental
as
reimbursement
for
trips
he
and
his
family
took
aboard
the
corporate
jet
to
Mr.
Keating
's
vacation
home
at
Cat
Cay
,
the
Bahamas
,
from
1984
through
1986
.

Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
meant
to
pay
for
the
trips
at
the
time
but
that
the
matter
``
fell
between
the
cracks
.

''
Mr.
Keating
,
his
family
members
and
associates
also
donated
$
112,000
to
Sen.
McCain
's
congressional
campaigns
over
the
years
,
according
to
press
accounts
.

But
Sen.
McCain
says
Mr.
Keating
broke
off
their
friendship
abruptly
in
1987
,
because
the
senator
refused
to
press
the
thrift
executive
's
case
as
vigorously
as
Mr.
Keating
wanted
.

``
He
became
very
angry
at
that
,
left
my
office
and
told
a
number
of
people
that
I
was
a
wimp
,
''
Sen.
McCain
recalls
.

In
July
,
California
newspapers
disclosed
that
Mr.
Keating
gave
$
850,000
in
corporate
funds
to
three
tax-exempt
voter
registration
organizations
in
1987
and
1988
at
the
behest
of
Sen.
Cranston
,
who
conceded
that
soliciting
the
money
was
``
a
pretty
stupid
thing
to
do
politically
.

''
In
addition
,
Sen.
Cranston
received
$
47,000
in
campaign
donations
through
Mr.
Keating
,
and
the
California
Democratic
party
received
$
85,000
in
corporate
donations
for
a
1986
get-out-the-vote
drive
that
benefited
the
senator
's
re-election
campaign
that
year
.

Also
in
July
,
Ohio
newspapers
disclosed
$
200,000
in
corporate
donations
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
National
Council
on
Public
Policy
,
a
political
committee
controlled
by
Sen.
Glenn
.

That
was
in
addition
to
$
34,000
in
direct
campaign
donations
arranged
by
Mr.
Keating
to
the
Ohio
senator
.

Mr.
Wertheimer
said
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
should
hire
a
special
outside
counsel
to
conduct
an
investigation
,
as
was
done
in
the
case
of
former
House
Speaker
James
Wright
.

Wilson
Abney
,
staff
director
of
the
ethics
panel
,
would
n't
comment
.

Sen.
Riegle
said
he
would
cooperate
with
any
inquiry
,
but
that
his
conduct
had
been
``
entirely
proper
.

''
Sen.
McCain
said
he
had
been
``
deeply
concerned
''
at
the
time
of
the
meeting
that
it
might
seem
to
be
improper
,
but
decided
it
was
``
entirely
appropriate
''
for
him
to
seek
fair
treatment
for
a
constituent
.

Sen.
Glenn
said
he
had
already
made
a
complete
disclosure
of
his
role
in
the
affair
and
``
I
am
completely
satisfied
to
let
this
matter
rest
in
the
hands
of
the
Senate
Ethics
Committee
.

''
Sen.
DeConcini
said
,
``
When
all
is
said
and
done
,
I
expect
to
be
fully
exonerated
.

''
Sen.
Cranston
,
who
had
already
volunteered
his
help
to
the
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
in
any
investigation
of
Mr.
Keating
,
portrayed
his
role
in
1987
as
prodding
regulators
to
act
.

``
Why
did
n't
the
Bank
Board
act
sooner
?
''
he
said
.

``
That
is
what
Common
Cause
should
ask
be
investigated
.

''
Trinity
Industries
Inc.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
to
manufacture
1,000
coal
rail
cars
for
Norfolk
Southern
Corp
.

Trinity
estimated
the
value
of
the
pact
at
more
than
$
40
million
.

Trinity
said
it
plans
to
begin
delivery
of
the
rail
cars
in
the
first
quarter
of
1990
.

It
said
the
1,000
rail
cars
are
in
addition
to
the
1,450
coal
rail
cars
presently
being
produced
for
Norfolk
Southern
,
a
Norfolk
,
Va.-based
railroad
concern
.

When
China
opened
its
doors
to
foreign
investors
in
1979
,
toy
makers
from
Hong
Kong
were
among
the
first
to
march
in
.

Today
,
with
about
75
%
of
the
companies
'
products
being
made
in
China
,
the
chairman
of
the
Hong
Kong
Toys
Council
,
Dennis
Ting
,
has
suggested
a
new
sourcing
label
:
``
Made
in
China
by
Hong
Kong
Companies
.

''
The
toy
makers
were
pushed
across
the
border
by
rising
labor
and
land
costs
in
the
British
colony
.

But
in
the
wake
of
the
shootings
in
Beijing
on
June
4
,
the
Hong
Kong
toy
industry
is
worrying
about
its
strong
dependence
on
China
.

Although
the
manufacturers
stress
that
production
has
n't
been
affected
by
China
's
political
turmoil
,
they
are
looking
for
additional
sites
.

The
toy
makers
,
and
their
foreign
buyers
,
cite
uncertainty
about
China
's
economic
and
political
policies
.

``
Nobody
wants
to
have
all
his
eggs
in
one
basket
,
''
says
David
Yeh
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
International
Matchbox
Group
Ltd
.

Indeed
,
Matchbox
and
other
leading
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
were
setting
up
factories
in
Southeast
Asia
,
especially
in
Thailand
,
long
before
the
massacre
.

Their
steps
were
partly
prompted
by
concern
over
a
deterioration
of
business
conditions
in
southern
China
.

By
diversifying
supply
sources
,
the
toy
makers
do
n't
intend
to
withdraw
from
China
,
manufacturers
and
foreign
buyers
say
.

It
would
n't
be
easy
to
duplicate
quickly
the
manufacturing
capacity
built
up
in
southern
China
during
the
past
decade
.

A
supply
of
cheap
labor
and
the
access
to
Hong
Kong
's
port
,
airport
,
banks
and
support
industries
,
such
as
printing
companies
,
have
made
China
's
Guangdong
province
a
premier
manufacturing
site
.

``
South
China
is
the
most
competitive
source
of
toys
in
the
world
,
''
says
Henry
Hu
,
executive
director
of
Wah
Shing
Toys
Consolidated
Ltd
.

Hong
Kong
trade
figures
illustrate
the
toy
makers
'
reliance
on
factories
across
the
border
.

In
1988
,
exports
of
domestically
produced
toys
and
games
fell
19
%
from
1987
,
to
HK$
10.05
billion
(
US$
1.29
billion
)
.

But
re-exports
,
mainly
from
China
,
jumped
75
%
,
to
HK$
15.92
billion
.

In
1989
's
first
seven
months
,
domestic
exports
fell
29
%
,
to
HK$
3.87
billion
,
while
re-exports
rose
56
%
,
to
HK$
11.28
billion
.

Manufacturers
say
there
is
no
immediate
substitute
for
southern
China
,
where
an
estimated
120,000
people
are
employed
by
the
toy
industry
.

``
For
the
next
few
years
,
like
it
or
not
,
China
is
going
to
be
the
main
supplier
,
''
says
Edmund
Young
,
vice
president
of
Perfecta
Enterprises
Ltd.
,
one
of
the
first
big
Hong
Kong
toy
makers
to
move
across
the
border
.

In
the
meantime
,
as
manufacturers
and
buyers
seek
new
sites
,
they
are
focusing
mainly
on
Southeast
Asia
.

Several
big
companies
have
established
manufacturing
joint
ventures
in
Thailand
,
including
Matchbox
,
Wah
Shing
and
Kader
Industrial
Co.
,
the
toy
manufacturer
headed
by
Mr.
Ting
.

Malaysia
,
the
Philippines
and
Indonesia
also
are
being
studied
.

With
the
European
Community
set
to
remove
its
internal
trade
barriers
in
1992
,
several
Hong
Kong
companies
are
beginning
to
consider
Spain
,
Portugal
and
Greece
as
possible
manufacturing
sites
.

Worries
about
China
came
just
as
Hong
Kong
's
toy
industry
was
recovering
from
a
1987
sales
slump
and
bankruptcy
filings
by
two
major
U.S.
companies
,
Worlds
of
Wonder
Inc.
and
Coleco
Industries
Inc
.

Hong
Kong
manufacturers
say
large
debt
writeoffs
and
other
financial
problems
resulting
from
the
1987
difficulties
chastened
the
local
industry
,
causing
it
to
tighten
credit
policies
and
financial
management
.

The
industry
regards
last
year
and
this
year
as
a
period
of
recovery
that
will
lead
to
improved
results
.

Still
,
they
long
for
a
``
mega-hit
''
toy
to
excite
retail
sales
in
the
U.S.
,
Hong
Kong
's
biggest
market
for
toys
and
games
.

The
closest
thing
the
colony
's
companies
have
to
a
U.S.
mega-hit
this
year
is
the
Teenage
Mutant
Ninja
Turtles
series
of
action
figures
manufactured
by
Playmates
Holdings
Ltd
.

Introduced
in
mid-1988
,
the
15-centimeter-tall
plastic
turtles
are
based
on
an
American
comic
book
and
television
series
.

Paul
Kwan
,
managing
director
of
Playmates
,
says
10
million
Ninja
Turtles
have
been
sold
,
placing
the
reptilian
warriors
among
the
10
biggest-selling
toys
in
the
U.S
.

Should
sales
continue
to
be
strong
through
the
Christmas
season
,
which
accounts
for
about
60
%
of
U.S.
retail
toy
sales
,
Mr.
Kwan
said
the
Ninja
Turtles
could
make
1989
a
record
sales
year
for
Playmates
.

Other
Hong
Kong
manufacturers
expect
their
results
to
improve
only
slightly
this
year
from
1988
.

Besides
the
lack
of
a
fast-selling
product
,
they
cite
the
continued
dominance
of
the
U.S.
market
by
Nintendo
Entertainment
System
,
an
expensive
video
game
made
by
Nintendo
Co.
of
Japan
.

Nintendo
buyers
have
little
money
left
to
spend
on
other
products
.

Many
of
the
toy
makers
'
problems
started
well
before
June
4
as
a
result
of
overstrained
infrastructure
and
Beijing
's
austerity
programs
launched
late
last
year
.

Toy
makers
complain
that
electricity
in
Guangdong
has
been
provided
only
three
days
a
week
in
recent
months
,
down
from
five
days
a
week
,
as
the
province
's
rapid
industrialization
has
outstripped
its
generating
capacity
.

Manufacturers
are
upgrading
standby
power
plants
.

Bank
credit
for
China
investments
all
but
dried
up
following
June
4
.

Also
,
concern
exists
that
the
harder-line
Beijing
leadership
will
tighten
its
control
of
Guangdong
,
which
has
been
the
main
laboratory
for
the
open-door
policy
and
economic
reforms
.

But
,
toy
manufacturers
and
other
industrialists
say
Beijing
will
be
restrained
from
tightening
controls
on
export-oriented
southern
China
.

They
say
China
's
trade
deficit
is
widening
and
the
country
is
too
short
of
foreign
exchange
for
it
to
hamper
production
in
Guangdong
.

``
The
Chinese
leaders
have
to
decide
whether
they
want
control
or
whether
the
want
exports
,
''
says
Mr.
Kwan
of
Playmates
.

The
Bush
administration
,
urging
the
Supreme
Court
to
give
states
more
leeway
to
restrict
abortions
,
said
minors
have
n't
any
right
to
abortion
without
the
consent
of
their
parents
.

Solicitor
General
Kenneth
Starr
argued
that
the
1973
Supreme
Court
decision
,
Roe
vs.
Wade
,
recognizing
a
constitutional
right
to
abortion
,
was
incorrect
.

He
also
argued
that
the
high
court
was
wrong
in
1976
to
rule
that
minors
have
a
right
to
abortion
that
ca
n't
be
absolutely
vetoed
by
their
parents
.

The
administration
's
position
was
outlined
in
a
friend-of-the-court
brief
filed
in
one
of
three
abortion
cases
the
Supreme
Court
will
hear
argued
and
will
decide
this
term
.

The
administration
filed
the
brief
in
an
appeal
involving
a
Minnesota
law
that
requires
that
both
parents
of
a
minor
be
notified
before
she
may
have
an
abortion
.

The
administration
urged
the
justices
to
adopt
a
legal
standard
suggested
by
Chief
Justice
William
Rehnquist
last
July
when
the
high
court
upheld
Missouri
's
abortion
restrictions
.

Under
that
standard
,
which
garnered
the
votes
of
only
three
of
the
nine
justices
,
a
state
restriction
of
abortion
is
constitutional
if
the
state
has
a
``
reasonable
''
justification
for
adopting
it
.

That
is
a
much
easier
standard
for
a
state
to
satisfy
than
the
Supreme
Court
's
test
since
1973
,
which
requires
a
state
to
have
a
``
compelling
''
reason
for
restricting
abortion
.

On
the
provisions
of
the
Minnesota
law
,
the
Bush
administration
said
that
requiring
that
both
parents
be
notified
is
a
reasonable
regulation
,
and
that
there
is
no
need
to
have
an
alternative
that
allows
minors
to
go
to
court
for
a
judge
's
permission
instead
.

The
case
,
Hodgson
vs.
Minnesota
,
will
be
argued
Nov.
29
.

Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
hit
hard
by
the
strength
of
the
dollar
overseas
,
said
net
income
for
the
third
quarter
dropped
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
.

The
nation
's
No.
1
aluminum
maker
earned
$
226.3
million
,
or
$
2.56
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Revenue
rose
11
%
to
$
2.83
billion
from
$
2.56
billion
.

Analysts
,
who
were
expecting
Alcoa
to
post
around
$
2.70
to
$
3
a
share
,
were
surprised
at
the
lackluster
third-quarter
results
.

``
It
's
disappointing
,
''
said
William
Siedenburg
,
an
analyst
with
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co
.

Much
of
the
earnings
decline
was
led
by
currency-exchange
rate
adjustments
,
which
affected
the
bottom
line
by
$
15.3
million
,
or
17
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
$
3.6
million
,
or
four
cents
a
share
,
the
previous
year
.

Lower
prices
for
aluminum
ingots
and
certain
alloy
products
and
a
shift
in
the
product
mix
also
contributed
to
lower
earnings
,
the
company
said
.

``
In
addition
,
costs
were
higher
partly
due
to
scheduled
plant
outages
for
modernization
work
,
''
the
company
said
.

Excluding
the
higher
tax
rate
,
which
rose
two
percentage
points
to
38
%
,
and
the
negative
exchange
rate
adjustment
,
the
company
would
have
met
analysts
'
expectations
,
said
R.
Wayne
Atwell
,
an
analyst
with
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

Noting
that
the
third
quarter
is
usually
the
aluminum
industry
's
slowest
,
Mr.
Atwell
added
,
``
the
third
quarter
is
never
a
bang
up
period
for
them
anyway
.

''
Nevertheless
,
the
company
said
shipments
were
up
slightly
to
679,000
metric
tons
from
671,000
,
buffing
the
impact
of
the
unexpected
earning
decline
.

The
results
were
announced
after
the
stock
market
closed
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
Friday
,
Alcoa
closed
at
$
72
a
share
,
down
$
4.75
,
in
a
sharply
lower
market
.

For
20
years
,
federal
rules
have
barred
the
three
major
television
networks
from
sharing
in
one
of
the
most
lucrative
and
fastest-growing
parts
of
the
television
business
.

And
for
six
years
,
NBC
,
ABC
and
CBS
have
negotiated
with
Hollywood
studios
in
a
futile
attempt
to
change
that
.

But
with
foreign
companies
snapping
up
U.S.
movie
studios
,
the
networks
are
pressing
their
fight
harder
than
ever
.

They
hope
the
foreign
deals
will
divide
the
Hollywood
opposition
and
prod
Congress
to
push
for
ending
federal
rules
that
prohibit
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
piece
of
rerun
sales
and
owning
part
of
the
shows
they
put
on
the
air
.

Even
network
executives
,
however
,
admit
privately
that
victory
--
either
in
Congress
or
in
talks
with
the
studios
--
is
highly
doubtful
any
time
soon
.

And
so
the
networks
also
are
pushing
for
new
ways
to
sidestep
the
``
fin-syn
''
provisions
,
known
formally
as
the
Financial
Interest
and
Syndication
Rules
.

That
became
clear
last
week
with
the
disclosure
that
National
Broadcasting
Co.
,
backed
by
the
deep
pockets
of
parent
General
Electric
Co.
,
had
tried
to
help
fund
Qintex
Australia
Ltd.
's
now-scuttled
$
1.5
billion
bid
for
Communications
Co
.

NBC
's
interest
may
revive
the
deal
,
which
killed
last
week
when
the
Australian
concern
had
trouble
raising
cash
.

Even
if
that
deal
is
n't
revived
,
NBC
hopes
to
find
another
.

``
Our
doors
are
open
,
''
an
NBC
spokesman
says
.

NBC
may
yet
find
a
way
to
take
a
passive
,
minority
interest
in
a
program-maker
without
violating
the
rules
.

And
any
NBC
effort
could
prompt
CBS
Inc.
and
ABC
's
parent
,
Capital
Inc.
,
to
look
for
ways
of
skirting
the
fin-syn
regulations
.

But
the
networks
'
push
may
only
aggravate
an
increasingly
bitter
rift
between
them
and
Hollywood
studios
.

Both
sides
are
to
sit
down
next
month
for
yet
another
meeting
on
how
they
might
agree
on
reducing
fin-syn
restraints
.

Few
people
privy
to
the
talks
expect
the
studios
to
budge
.

The
networks
still
are
``
uninhibited
in
their
authority
''
over
what
shows
get
on
the
air
,
charges
Motion
Picture
Association
President
Jack
Valenti
,
the
most
vociferous
opponent
of
rescinding
the
rules
.

Studios
are
``
powerless
''
to
get
shows
in
prime-time
lineups
and
keep
them
there
long
enough
to
go
into
lucrative
rerun
sales
,
he
contends
.

And
that
's
why
the
rules
,
for
the
most
part
,
must
stay
in
place
,
he
says
.

Studio
executives
in
on
the
talks
-
including
officials
at
Paramount
Communications
Inc.
,
Fries
Entertainment
Inc.
,
Warner
Communications
Inc.
and
MCA
Inc.
--
declined
to
be
interviewed
.

But
Mr.
Valenti
,
who
represents
the
studios
,
asserts
:
``
The
whole
production
industry
,
to
a
man
,
is
on
the
side
of
preserving
''
the
rules
.

Such
proclamations
leave
network
officials
all
the
more
doubtful
that
the
studios
will
bend
.

``
They
do
n't
seem
to
have
an
incentive
to
negotiate
,
''
says
one
network
executive
.

``
And
there
's
no
indication
that
Washington
is
prepared
to
address
the
rules
.

That
's
the
problem
,
is
n't
it
?
''
Indeed
it
is
.

Congress
has
said
repeatedly
it
wants
no
part
of
the
mess
,
urging
the
studios
and
the
networks
,
which
license
rights
to
air
shows
made
by
the
studios
,
to
work
out
their
own
compromise
.

But
recent
developments
have
made
the
networks
--
and
NBC
President
Robert
Wright
,
in
particular
--
ever
more
adamant
that
the
networks
must
be
unshackled
to
survive
.

The
latest
provocation
:
Sony
Corp.
's
plan
to
acquire
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc.
for
$
3.4
billion
,
and
to
buy
independent
producer
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co.
for
$
200
million
.

``
I
wonder
what
Walter
Cronkite

the
Broadcast

Evening
News

''
wrote
J.B.
Holston
,
an
NBC
vice
president
,
in
a
commentary
in
last
week
's
issue
of
Broadcasting
magazine
.

In
his
article
,
Mr.
Holston
,
who
was
in
Europe
last
week
and
unavailable
,
complained
that
the
``
archaic
restraints
''
in
fin-syn
rules
have
``
contributed
directly
to
the
acquisition
of
the
studios
by
non-U.S.
enterprises
.

''
(
He
did
n't
mention
that
NBC
,
in
the
meantime
,
was
hoping
to
assist
Australia
's
Qintex
in
buying
An
NBC
spokesman
counters
that
Mr.
Holston
's
lament
was
``
entirely
consistent
''
with
NBC
plans
because
the
U.S.
rules
would
limit
NBC
's
involvement
in
the
Qintex
deal
so
severely
as
to
be
``
light
years
away
from
the
type
of
unrestrained
deals
available
to
Sony
--
and
everyone
else
except
the
three
networks
.

''
The
Big
Three
's
drumbeat
for
deregulation
began
intensifying
in
the
summer
when
the
former
Time
Inc.
went
ahead
with
plans
to
acquire
Warner
.

Although
Time
already
had
a
long-term
contract
to
buy
movies
from
Warner
,
the
merger
will
let
Time
's
largely
unregulated
pay-cable
channel
,
Home
Box
Office
,
own
the
Warner
movies
aired
on
HBO
--
a
vertical
integration
that
is
effectively
blocked
by
fin-syn
regulations
.

NBC
's
Mr.
Wright
led
the
way
in
decrying
the
networks
'
inability
to
match
a
Time-Warner
combination
.

He
spoke
up
again
when
the
Sony
bid
for
Columbia
was
announced
.

Since
NBC
's
interest
in
the
Qintex
bid
for
was
disclosed
,
Mr.
Wright
has
n't
been
available
for
comment
.

With
a
Qintex
deal
,
NBC
would
move
into
uncharted
territory
--
possibly
raising
hackles
at
the
studios
and
in
Washington
.

``
It
's
never
really
been
tested
,
''
says
William
Lilley
III
,
who
as
a
top
CBS
executive
spent
years
lobbying
to
have
the
rules
lifted
.

He
now
runs
Policy
Communications
in
Washington
,
consulting
to
media
companies
.

Fin-syn
rules
do
n't
explicitly
block
a
network
from
buying
a
passive
,
small
stake
in
a
company
that
profits
from
the
rerun
syndication
networks
ca
n't
enjoy
.

Hence
,
NBC
might
be
able
to
take
,
say
,
a
5
%
stake
in
a
company
such
as
.

If
the
transaction
raised
objections
,
the
studio
's
syndication
operations
could
be
spun
off
into
a
separate
firm
in
which
the
network
does
n't
have
a
direct
stake
.

But
such
convolutions
would
still
block
the
networks
from
grabbing
a
big
chunk
of
the
riches
of
syndication
.

Under
current
rules
,
even
when
a
network
fares
well
with
a
100%-owned
series
--
ABC
,
for
example
,
made
a
killing
in
broadcasting
its
popular
``
Moonlighting
''
--
it
is
n't
allowed
to
share
in
the
continuing
proceeds
when
the
reruns
are
sold
to
local
stations
.

Instead
,
ABC
will
have
to
sell
off
the
rights
for
a
one-time
fee
.

The
networks
admit
that
the
chances
of
getting
the
relief
they
want
are
slim
--
for
several
years
at
the
least
.

Six
years
ago
they
were
tantalizingly
close
.

The
Reagan-era
Federal
Communications
Commission
had
ruled
in
favor
of
killing
most
of
the
rules
.

Various
evidence
,
including
a
Brookings
Institution
study
of
some
800
series
that
the
networks
had
aired
and
had
partly
owned
in
the
1960s
,
showed
the
networks
did
n't
wield
undue
control
over
the
studios
as
had
been
alleged
.

But
just
eight
days
before
the
rules
were
to
die
,
former
President
Ronald
Reagan
,
a
one-time
actor
,
intervened
on
behalf
of
Hollywood
.

The
FCC
effort
collapsed
.

The
networks
and
studios
have
bickered
ever
since
.

Network
officials
involved
in
the
studio
talks
may
hope
the
foreign
influx
builds
more
support
in
Washington
,
but
that
seems
unlikely
.

In
Congress
,
the
issue
falters
:
It
's
about
money
,
not
program
quality
,
and
Hollywood
has
lots
of
clout
given
its
fund
raising
for
senators
and
representatives
overseeing
the
issue
.

A
spokesman
for
Rep.
Edward
J.
Markey
(
D-Mass.
)
,
who
heads
a
subcommittee
that
oversees
the
FCC
,
says
Mr.
Markey
feels
``
the
world
has
been
forever
changed
by
the
Sony-Columbia
deal
.

''
But
he
said
Mr.
Markey
hopes
this
pushes
the
networks
and
studios
to
work
it
out
on
their
own
.

And
at
the
FCC
,
meanwhile
,
new
Chairman
Alfred
C.
Sikes
has
said
he
wants
the
two
sides
to
hammer
out
their
own
plan
.

Recognition
Equipment
Inc.
said
it
settled
a
civil
action
filed
against
it
by
the
federal
government
on
behalf
of
the
U.S.
Postal
Service
.

The
government
sued
the
company
in
April
,
seeking
$
23,000
and
other
unspecified
damages
related
to
an
alleged
contract-steering
scheme
.

The
suit
named
the
company
,
former
chief
executive
officer
William
G.
Moore
Jr.
,
former
vice
president
Robert
W.
Reedy
and
five
defendants
who
were
n't
part
of
the
company
.

The
suit
charged
the
defendants
with
causing
Peter
E.
Voss
,
an
ex-member
of
the
Postal
Service
board
of
governors
,
to
accept
$
23,000
in
bribes
,
kickbacks
and
gratuities
.

Mr.
Voss
was
previously
sentenced
to
four
years
in
prison
and
fined
$
11,000
for
his
role
in
the
scheme
.

In
the
agreement
,
Recognition
agreed
to
pay
the
government
$
20,000
in
return
for
the
release
of
all
claims
against
the
company
,
Mr.
Moore
and
Mr.
Reedy
.

The
five
additional
defendants
were
n't
parties
to
the
settlement
.

A
trial
on
criminal
allegations
against
the
company
and
the
same
two
former
executives
began
Sept.
27
in
federal
court
for
the
District
of
Columbia
.

They
were
indicted
last
October
on
charges
of
fraud
,
theft
and
conspiracy
related
to
an
effort
to
win
$
400
million
in
Postal
Service
equipment
contracts
by
the
maker
of
data
management
equipment
.

The
company
and
its
executives
deny
the
charges
.

In
a
related
development
,
Recognition
Equipment
said
the
Postal
Service
has
barred
the
company
from
bidding
on
postal
contracts
for
an
additional
120
days
.

The
Postal
Service
originally
suspended
the
company
Oct.
7
,
1988
,
and
has
been
renewing
the
ban
ever
since
.

The
company
said
it
will
continue
to
pursue
a
lifting
of
the
suspension
.

Intel
Corp.
reported
a
50
%
drop
in
third-quarter
net
income
,
partly
because
of
a
one-time
charge
for
discontinued
operations
.

The
big
semiconductor
and
computer
maker
,
said
it
had
net
of
$
72
million
,
or
38
cents
,
down
50
%
from
$
142.7
million
,
or
78
cents
a
share
.

The
lower
net
included
a
charge
of
$
35
million
,
equal
to
12
cents
a
share
on
an
after-tax
basis
,
for
the
cost
of
abandoning
a
computer-systems
joint
venture
with
Siemens
AG
of
West
Germany
.

Earning
also
fell
from
the
year-ago
period
because
of
slowing
microchip
demand
.

Sales
amounted
to
$
771.4
million
,
down
1.7
%
from
$
784.9
million
.

Intel
's
stock
rose
in
early
over-the-counter
trading
Friday
,
as
investors
appeared
relieved
that
the
company
's
income
from
continuing
operations
was
only
slightly
below
the
second
quarter
's
earnings
of
$
99.3
million
,
or
53
cents
a
share
,
and
that
sales
actually
exceeded
the
$
747.3
million
for
the
second
period
.

But
Intel
later
succumbed
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
,
closing
at
$
31.75
,
down
$
2.125
.

In
August
,
Intel
warned
that
third-quarter
earnings
might
be
``
flat
to
down
''
from
the
previous
period
's
because
of
slowing
sales
growth
of
its
80386
microprocessor
,
start-up
costs
associated
with
a
line
of
computers
and
costs
of
preparing
for
mass
shipments
of
the
company
's
new
80486
chip
in
the
current
quarter
.

On
Friday
,
Andrew
S.Grove
,
Intel
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
``
Intel
's
business
is
strong
.

Our
bookings
improved
as
the
quarter
progressed
and
September
was
especially
good
.

For
the
full
quarter
,
our
bookings
were
higher
than
the
previous
quarter
,
and
our
book-to-bill
ratio
exceeded
1.0
.

''
For
the
nine-month
period
,
Intel
reported
net
of
$
268.3
million
,
or
$
1.43
a
share
,
down
27
%
from
$
367.1
million
,
or
$
2.05
a
share
.

Revenue
amounted
to
$
2.23
billion
,
up
slightly
from
$
2.15
billion
.

Walter
Sisulu
and
the
African
National
Congress
came
home
yesterday
.

After
26
years
in
prison
,
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
77-year-old
former
secretary-general
of
the
liberation
movement
,
was
dropped
off
at
his
house
by
a
prison
services
'
van
just
as
the
sun
was
coming
up
.

At
the
same
time
,
six
ANC
colleagues
,
five
of
whom
were
arrested
with
him
in
1963
and
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
,
were
reunited
with
their
families
at
various
places
around
the
country
.

And
as
the
graying
men
returned
to
their
homes
,
the
ANC
,
outlawed
in
South
Africa
since
1960
and
still
considered
to
be
the
chief
public
enemy
by
the
white
government
,
defiantly
returned
to
the
streets
of
the
country
's
black
townships
.

A
huge
ANC
flag
,
with
black
,
green
and
gold
stripes
,
was
hoisted
over
the
rickety
gate
at
Mr.
Sisulu
's
modest
house
,
while
on
the
street
out
front
,
boys
displayed
the
ANC
colors
on
their
shirts
,
caps
and
scarves
.

At
the
small
four-room
home
of
Elias
Motsoaledi
,
a
leading
ANC
unionist
and
a
former
commander
in
the
group
's
armed
wing
,
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
,
well-wishers
stuck
little
ANC
flags
in
their
hair
and
a
man
tooted
on
an
antelope
horn
wrapped
in
ANC
ribbons
.

``
I
am
happy
to
see
the
spirit
of
the
people
,
''
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
looking
dapper
in
a
new
gray
suit
.

As
the
crowd
outside
his
home
shouted
``
ANC
,
ANC
,
''
the
old
man
shot
his
fists
into
the
air
.

``
I
'm
inspired
by
the
mood
of
the
people
.

''
Under
the
laws
of
the
land
,
the
ANC
remains
an
illegal
organization
,
and
its
headquarters
are
still
in
Lusaka
,
Zambia
.

But
the
unconditional
release
of
the
seven
leaders
,
who
once
formed
the
intellectual
and
organizational
core
of
the
ANC
,
is
a
de
facto
unbanning
of
the
movement
and
the
rebirth
of
its
internal
wing
.

``
The
government
can
never
put
the
ANC
back
into
the
bottle
again
,
''
said
Cassim
Saloojee
,
a
veteran
anti-apartheid
activist
on
hand
to
welcome
Mr.
Sisulu
.

``
Things
have
gone
too
far
for
the
government
to
stop
them
now
.

There
's
no
turning
back
.

''
There
was
certainly
no
stopping
the
tide
of
ANC
emotion
last
night
,
when
hundreds
of
people
jammed
into
the
Holy
Cross
Anglican
Church
in
Soweto
for
what
became
the
first
ANC
rally
in
the
country
in
30
years
.

Deafening
chants
of
``
ANC
''
and
``
Umkhonto
we
Sizwe
''
shook
the
church
as
the
seven
aging
men
vowed
that
the
ANC
would
continue
its
fight
against
the
government
and
the
policies
of
racial
segregation
on
all
fronts
,
including
the
armed
struggle
.

And
they
called
on
the
government
to
release
Nelson
Mandela
,
the
ANC
's
leading
figure
,
who
was
jailed
with
them
and
remains
in
prison
.

Without
him
,
said
Mr.
Sisulu
,
the
freeing
of
the
others
``
is
only
a
half-measure
.

''
President
F.W.
de
Klerk
released
the
ANC
men
--
along
with
one
of
the
founding
members
of
the
Pan
Africanist
Congress
,
a
rival
liberation
group
--
as
part
of
his
efforts
to
create
a
climate
of
trust
and
peace
in
which
his
government
can
begin
negotiations
with
black
leaders
over
a
new
constitution
aimed
at
giving
blacks
a
voice
in
national
government
.

But
Pretoria
may
instead
be
creating
a
climate
for
more
turmoil
and
uncertainty
in
this
racially
divided
country
.

As
other
repressive
governments
,
particularly
Poland
and
the
Soviet
Union
,
have
recently
discovered
,
initial
steps
to
open
up
society
can
create
a
momentum
for
radical
change
that
becomes
difficult
,
if
not
impossible
,
to
control
.

As
the
days
go
by
,
the
South
African
government
will
be
ever
more
hard
pressed
to
justify
the
continued
imprisonment
of
Mr.
Mandela
as
well
as
the
continued
banning
of
the
ANC
and
enforcement
of
the
state
of
emergency
.

If
it
does
n't
yield
on
these
matters
,
and
eventually
begin
talking
directly
to
the
ANC
,
the
expectations
and
promise
raised
by
yesterday
's
releases
will
turn
to
disillusionment
and
unrest
.

If
it
does
,
the
large
number
of
right-wing
whites
,
who
oppose
any
concessions
to
the
black
majority
,
will
step
up
their
agitation
and
threats
to
take
matters
into
their
own
hands
.

The
newly
released
ANC
leaders
also
will
be
under
enormous
pressure
.

The
government
is
watching
closely
to
see
if
their
presence
in
the
townships
leads
to
increased
anti-government
protests
and
violence
;
if
it
does
,
Pretoria
will
use
this
as
a
reason
to
keep
Mr.
Mandela
behind
bars
.

Pretoria
has
n't
forgotten
why
they
were
all
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment
in
the
first
place
:
for
sabotage
and
conspiracy
to
overthrow
the
government
.

In
addition
,
the
government
is
figuring
that
the
releases
could
create
a
split
between
the
internal
and
external
wings
of
the
ANC
and
between
the
newly
freed
leaders
and
those
activists
who
have
emerged
as
leaders
inside
the
country
during
their
imprisonment
.

In
order
to
head
off
any
divisions
,
Mr.
Mandela
,
in
a
meeting
with
his
colleagues
before
they
were
released
,
instructed
them
to
report
to
the
ANC
headquarters
in
Lusaka
as
soon
as
possible
.

The
men
also
will
be
faced
with
bridging
the
generation
gap
between
themselves
and
the
country
's
many
militant
black
youths
,
the
so-called
young
lions
who
are
anxious
to
see
the
old
lions
in
action
.

Says
Peter
Mokaba
,
president
of
the
South
African
Youth
Congress
:
``
We
will
be
expecting
them
to
act
like
leaders
of
the
ANC
.

''
They
never
considered
themselves
to
be
anything
else
.

At
last
night
's
rally
,
they
called
on
their
followers
to
be
firm
,
yet
disciplined
,
in
their
opposition
to
apartheid
.

``
We
emphasize
discipline
because
we
know
that
the
government
is
very
,
very
sensitive
,
''
said
Andrew
Mlangeni
,
another
early
Umkhonto
leader
who
is
now
63
.

``
We
want
to
see
Nelson
Mandela
and
all
our
comrades
out
of
prison
,
and
if
we
are
n't
disciplined
we
may
not
see
them
here
with
us
.

''
There
's
an
intense
debate
in
South
Korean
President
Roh
Tae
Woo
's
inner
circle
over
his
scheduled
speech
Wednesday
to
a
joint
meeting
of
Congress
:
Should
he
give
it
in
English
or
Korean
?
It
would
be
more
effective
with
the
U.S.
politicians
and
public
in
English
,
the
president
's
foreign
policy
advisers
argue
.

But
,
counter
some
domestic
political
aides
,
it
would
hurt
Mr.
Roh
at
home
if
he
seems
to
be
pandering
to
the
Americans
.

U.S.
politicians
and
policy-makers
would
do
well
to
remember
such
backhome
pressures
on
the
South
Korean
president
as
they
prepare
for
an
important
series
of
meetings
with
him
this
week
.

For
U.S.-South
Korean
relations
,
in
economic
and
security
terms
,
are
at
their
most
critical
stage
since
the
Korean
War
.

When
most
Americans
think
about
South
Korea
,
they
still
conjure
up
images
of
the
war
years
,
popularized
by
the
TV
series
M\*A\*S\*H
.

But
South
Korea
no
longer
is
a
backwater
,
Third
World
country
.

With
a
dynamic
,
growing
economy
,
it
is
the
U.S.
's
seventh-largest
trading
partner
.

Moreover
,
the
Korean
peninsula
remains
one
of
the
strategic
focal
points
of
East
Asia
;
there
are
43,000
U.S.
troops
stationed
there
.

And
the
country
is
at
a
political
crossroads
now
,
as
it
struggles
with
its
new
experiment
in
democracy
.

South
Korea
is
``
critically
important
to
us
now
,
both
economically
and
in
terms
of
security
,
''
says
Sen.
Richard
Lugar
(
R.
,
Ind.
)
,
the
former
chairman
of
the
Senate
Foreign
Relations
Committee
.

``
Unfortunately
,
many
Americans
do
n't
think
much
about
Korea
.

But
the
miracle
of
their
economic
growth
and
the
development
of
democracy
--
imperfect
though
it
is
--
are
very
important
to
the
United
States
.

''
One
major
topic
during
Mr.
Roh
's
visit
will
be
human
rights
.

Due
process
still
is
denied
in
South
Korea
;
a
few
months
ago
,
Kim
Dae
Jung
,
the
major
opposition
leader
,
was
detained
and
interrogated
for
20
hours
by
security
thugs
.

Just
as
Pope
John
Paul
II
did
in
Seoul
last
week
,
President
Bush
and
members
of
Congress
ought
to
tell
Mr.
Roh
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
this
kind
of
behavior
is
unacceptable
.

But
context
is
important
.

South
Korea
had
a
free
election
last
year
;
the
liberals
lost
only
because
they
could
n't
unite
behind
one
candidate
.

Moreover
,
there
is
a
violent
anti-U.S.
minority
in
South
Korea
--
as
demonstrated
by
the
handful
of
radical
students
who
broke
into
U.S.
Ambassador
Donald
Gregg
's
residence
in
Seoul
Friday
and
vandalized
it
(
the
ambassador
and
his
wife
were
unharmed
)
.

Mr.
Roh
,
a
former
general
and
a
member
of
the
repressive
previous
regime
,
has
made
impressive
strides
in
supporting
democratic
values
and
institutions
.

It
is
n't
a
perfect
democracy
,
but
it
's
a
far
cry
from
the
authoritarian
rule
of
only
a
few
years
ago
.

One
thing
that
has
n't
changed
in
South
Korea
is
paranoia
about
North
Korea
;
several
people
are
being
prosecuted
for
making
unapproved
visits
to
the
communist
north
.

But
a
visit
to
Panmunjom
,
where
the
constant
tension
between
the
communists
and
the
joint
U.S.-South
Korean
forces
is
palpable
,
makes
it
easier
to
understand
these
feelings
.

Sometimes
U.S.
politicians
forget
that
North
Korea
,
a
country
with
a
population
of
only
20
million
,
has
an
armed
force
of
over
one
million
troops
,
the
sixth
largest
in
the
world
.

Whatever
winds
of
change
are
blowing
through
much
of
the
communist
bloc
,
they
have
n't
reached
Pyongyang
.

As
long
as
it
continues
to
pose
a
real
threat
,
U.S.
critics
ought
to
go
slow
on
demands
to
reduce
troop
levels
in
South
Korea
.

The
major
topic
when
Mr.
Roh
calls
on
administration
and
congressional
figures
this
week
will
be
economics
and
trade
.

South
Korea
hardly
is
without
fault
for
trade
frictions
with
the
U.S.
;
most
experts
in
the
administration
think
that
Commerce
Secretary
Robert
Mosbacher
got
it
exactly
wrong
a
few
months
ago
when
he
declared
that
South
Korea
is
more
open
economically
than
Japan
.

On
agricultural
products
in
particular
--
everything
from
beef
to
apples
--
the
Koreans
have
succumbed
to
domestic
political
pressures
for
protectionism
.

Yet
,
earlier
this
year
,
South
Korea
promised
to
make
some
real
concessions
on
its
investment
laws
and
other
trade
impediments
.

They
enabled
the
country
to
avoid
being
targeted
as
an
unfair
trade
partner
under
the
tough
``
Super
301
''
section
of
the
1988
U.S.
trade
act
.

Separately
,
as
a
result
of
the
revaluation
of
the
won
and
other
measures
,
the
almost
$
10
billion
trade
surplus
the
South
Koreans
enjoyed
with
the
U.S
last
year
will
be
cut
in
half
this
year
.

Moreover
,
just
a
few
days
ago
,
the
national
assembly
,
with
the
governing
and
opposition
parties
in
an
unusual
alliance
,
passed
a
resolution
calling
for
a
gradual
opening
up
of
South
Korean
agricultural
markets
.

It
's
appropriate
for
U.S.
officials
to
keep
hammering
for
more
open
trade
policies
,
as
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
did
in
Seoul
last
week
.

But
there
's
also
sometimes
a
tendency
in
American
political
circles
to
pick
especially
on
South
Korea
,
out
of
frustration
over
our
inability
to
do
much
about
Japan
.

That
's
counterproductive
.

Most
importantly
,
it
's
time
for
American
policy-makers
to
better
appreciate
that
our
economic
future
rests
more
with
Asia
--
Seoul
as
well
as
Tokyo
--
than
anyplace
else
.

The
U.S.
always
ought
to
stand
up
for
its
interests
,
but
it
's
essential
that
U.S.
officials
have
an
appreciation
of
the
politics
and
history
of
our
allies
.

In
the
upper
echelons
of
the
Roh
Tae
Woo
's
government
,
they
're
still
buzzing
about
Commerce
Secretary
Mosbacher
's
trip
to
South
Korea
earlier
this
year
.

It
seems
he
learned
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
South
Korea
had
been
occupied
for
decades
by
Japan
.

Bolstered
by
a
robust
long-distance
business
,
the
telephone
industry
is
expected
to
post
a
healthy
profit
increase
for
the
third
quarter
.

Analysts
estimate
that
third-quarter
earnings
for
the
industry
will
increase
as
much
as
19
%
from
the
year-earlier
period
.

If
so
,
their
cumulative
earnings
could
hit
$
4.12
billion
.

Most
of
the
earnings
growth
,
however
,
will
come
from
the
long-distance
sector
.

American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
is
expected
to
post
a
profit
increase
of
about
18
%
and
MCI
Communications
Corp.
's
earnings
are
expected
to
surge
58
%
.

United
Telecommunications
Inc.
reported
last
Wednesday
that
third-quarter
net
income
climbed
75
%
to
$
94.6
million
,
or
90
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
1.93
billion
.

United
Telecom
's
Sprint
unit
posted
operating
profit
of
$
60
million
.

Paul
Aran
,
a
telecommunications
analyst
with
Bear
,
Stearns
&
Co.
,
said
the
long-distance
companies
have
been
buoyed
by
strong
growth
in
the
facsimile
and
data-service
business
.

He
said
declining
long-distance
prices
also
have
helped
stimulate
usage
.

The
local
telephone
companies
,
however
,
are
n't
expected
to
fare
as
well
.

Growth
is
predicted
to
be
in
the
1
%
to
2
%
range
for
most
companies
,
with
Southern
New
England
Telephone
and
GTE
Corp.
posting
profit
increases
in
the
neighborhood
of
10
%
.

``
The
long-distance
companies
have
kept
their
momentum
,
''
says
Robert
Morris
III
,
a
telecommunications
analyst
with
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
,
``
while
the
pace
of
growth
for
the
local
telephone
companies
is
slowing
.

''
That
's
especially
true
for
the
regional
Bell
companies
.

He
said
regulation
is
primarily
responsible
for
the
Bells
'
dull
earnings
growth
.

Most
companies
have
reached
their
maximum
allowed
earnings
ceilings
,
which
are
set
by
regulators
.

``
This
signals
the
need
for
regulatory
change
,
''
Mr.
Morris
said
.

Pacific
Telesis
Group
,
which
is
expected
to
post
earnings
of
about
75
cents
a
share
,
obtained
regulatory
relief
from
California
regulators
last
week
.

Under
the
plan
,
the
company
is
allowed
to
earn
more
if
it
can
operate
more
efficiently
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
Pacific
Telesis
earned
$
318
million
,
or
75
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
2.38
billion
.

Analysts
expect
installations
of
new
telephone
lines
to
grow
about
3
%
.

However
,
GTE
,
BellSouth
Corp.
and
Pacific
Telesis
,
which
operate
in
territories
with
hearty
economies
,
are
expected
to
report
new-telephone-line
growth
in
the
range
of
4
%
to
5
%
.

Nynex
Corp.
's
profits
could
begin
to
show
signs
of
weakening
from
the
effects
of
a
nearly
three-month
strike
,
while
other
Bell
companies
,
such
as
Ameritech
and
Southwestern
Bell
Corp.
,
could
be
hurt
in
the
quarter
by
one-time
charges
associated
with
the
settlement
of
new
union
contracts
.

Mr.
Aran
,
the
Bear
Stearns
analyst
,
said
that
generally
,
after
eight
weeks
,
``
A
strike
starts
hurting
earnings
.

I
'm
waiting
to
see
what
the
impact
is
on
Nynex
.

''
Analysts
predict
Nynex
earnings
will
be
about
$
1.57
a
share
,
compared
with
$
1.72
a
share
a
year
earlier
,
when
the
company
earned
$
338.9
million
on
sales
of
$
3.18
billion
.

The
independent
telephone
companies
also
may
post
third-quarter
results
that
trail
the
comparable
year-ago
period
.

Rochester
Telephone
Co.
,
for
instance
,
said
it
expects
third-quarter
earnings
to
be
``
somewhat
lower
''
than
the
year-earlier
quarter
--
even
though
the
company
expects
to
post
an
extraordinary
gain
of
50
cents
during
the
period
.

The
company
said
higher
expenses
and
competitive
pressures
hampered
earnings
.

For
the
1988
third
quarter
,
Rochester
Telephone
reported
a
net
income
of
$
12.9
million
,
or
$
1.10
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
120.2
million
.

The
tug
of
war
between
Warner
Communications
Inc.
and
Sony
Corp.
over
movie
producers
Peter
Guber
and
Jon
Peters
has
exploded
into
a
legal
battle
that
could
prove
an
embarrassing
setback
to
Sony
's
plans
to
enter
the
U.S.
movie
business
.

On
Friday
,
after
two
weeks
of
fruitless
settlement
talks
,
Warner
filed
suit
in
Los
Angeles
Superior
Court
against
Sony
and
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
Co.
,
charging
Sony
with
inducing
the
two
producers
to
breach
a
five-year
contract
with
Warner
.

The
suit
seeks
$
1
billion
in
damages
and
an
injunction
barring
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
from
taking
the
top
management
posts
at
Columbia
Pictures
Entertainment
Inc
.

As
previously
reported
,
Sony
has
agreed
to
pay
$
3.4
billion
to
acquire
Columbia
and
separately
has
agreed
to
pay
$
200
million
for
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
to
obtain
the
services
of
its
two
co-chief
executives
.

Sony
and
Guber
Peters
promptly
countersued
,
charging
Warner
with
attempting
to
interfere
in
Sony
's
acquisition
of
the
two
companies
and
with
falsely
asserting
that
the
Guber
Peters
agreement
with
Warner
prevents
them
from
accepting
the
senior
management
posts
at
Columbia
.

At
issue
in
the
lawsuits
is
the
contract
signed
last
March
by
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
that
requires
the
two
to
make
movies
exclusively
for
Warner
for
the
next
five
years
.

Sony
and
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
maintain
that
the
contract
does
n't
prohibit
taking
an
executive
post
at
another
studio
.

Moreover
,
they
assert
,
the
producers
have
an
oral
agreeement
with
Warner
Bros.
studio
executives
that
gives
them
the
right
to
``
terminate
the
producer
relationship
in
the
event
they
were
given
and
chose
to
accept
the
opportunity
to
become
senior
executives
of
a
motion
picture
studio
,
''
according
to
their
countersuit
.

Warner
,
for
its
part
,
maintains
that
the
written
agreement
prevents
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
from
doing
anything
else
in
the
motion
picture
business
.

Warner
says
in
its
suit
that
Sony
``
has
unethically
and
illegally
sought
to
steal
the
services
of
Guber
and
Peters
and
injure
Warner
as
a
major
competitor
of
Columbia
.

''
Moreover
,
Warner
says
,
Sony
enticed
the
producers
with
``
unprecedented
financial
rewards
to
breach
their
binding
contractual
commitments
to
Warner
.

''
Warner
also
names
in
its
suit
the
two
producers
,
Sony
Corp.
of
America
Vice
Chairman
Michael
Schulof
,
and
Walter
Yetnikoff
,
head
of
Sony
's
CBS
Records
unit
.

Sony
responded
in
its
countersuit
by
charging
Warner
,
its
chief
executive
Steven
J.
Ross
,
and
Warner
Bros.
unit
chairman
Robert
Daly
and
President
Terry
Semel
with
embarking
on
an
unlawful
scheme
to
interfere
with
and
disrupt
Sony
's
acquisitions
.

Warner
,
which
is
in
the
process
of
being
acquired
by
Time
Warner
Inc.
,
is
attempting
to
``
sabotage
''
Sony
's
efforts
as
part
of
a
``
plan
and
scheme
to
dominate
and
control
the
entertainment
business
,
''
the
countersuit
from
Sony
and
Guber
Peters
adds
.

Warner
also
appears
to
be
trying
to
embarrass
Sony
by
accusing
the
Japanese
company
's
U.S
executives
,
Messrs.
Schulof
and
Yetnikoff
,
of
dishonorable
dealings
.

In
its
suit
,
Warner
says
that
Mr.
Ross
warned
Sony
's
Mr.
Schulof
on
Sept.
26
at
a
dinner
in
Washington
,
``
with
Guber
Peters
in
mind
''
that
in
the
U.S.
``
it
is
essential
that
corporations
honor
written
contracts
and
do
not
induce
breach
of
contracts
by
others
.

''
Sony
went
ahead
the
next
day
anyway
and
executed
its
own
five-year
agreement
with
the
producers
and
agreed
to
buy
their
company
,
the
suit
adds
.

Moreover
,
the
suit
adds
that
Sony
initially
said
it
would
n't
buy
Guber
Peters
unless
the
Warner
contract
was
settled
.

On
Tuesday
,
although
a
settlement
was
n't
reached
,
Sony
publicly
announced
it
would
acquire
Guber
Peters
.

``
Sony
has
thus
knowingly
and
willfully
,
and
over
Warner
's
protests
,
induced
Guber
and
Peters
to
repudiate
their
contract
with
Warner
,
''
the
suit
says
.

Warner
's
decision
to
file
suit
in
the
wake
of
its
failure
to
reach
a
settlement
with
Sony
did
n't
surprise
executives
at
rival
studios
,
who
say
Warner
is
only
protecting
its
own
interests
.

The
outcome
of
the
legal
battle
,
they
add
,
could
redefine
contractual
relationships
in
Hollywood
,
where
the
unwritten
rule
has
often
been
that
contracts
were
made
to
be
broken
.

In
Warner
's
case
,
the
studio
obviously
regards
the
relationship
with
Guber
Peters
as
a
crucial
factor
in
Warner
's
recent
success
and
a
central
part
of
its
future
plans
.

Warner
has
relied
heavily
on
the
two
to
find
and
produce
movies
for
the
studio
,
including
this
summer
's
hit
``
Batman
.

''
Warner
says
in
its
suit
that
``
Guber
and
Peters
claim
to
have
generated
over
one-half
billion
dollars
in
profits
for
Warner
from
combined
projects
,
''
a
claim
Warner
does
n't
dispute
.

And
Warner
says
it
is
currently
financing
about
50
new
projects
being
developed
by
the
two
producers
.

Under
an
earlier
agreement
with
Warner
,
the
producers
were
allowed
to
make
movies
elsewhere
.

For
example
,
they
made
the
hit
``
Rainman
''
for
Communications
Co
.

But
when
Warner
signed
a
new
agreement
with
the
two
in
March
,
the
terms
specifically
prohibited
them
from
serving
as
producers
or
executive
producers
of
movies
for
any
other
studio
.

Sony
and
the
Guber
Peters
executives
say
in
their
countersuit
,
however
,
that
the
new
contract
eliminated
language
barring
the
two
from
serving
``
in
any
other
capacity
''
in
the
motion
picture
business
.

And
they
appear
to
be
relying
heavily
on
an
alleged
``
oral
agreement
''
the
two
producers
claim
to
have
with
Warner
that
would
let
them
out
of
their
written
contract
in
the
event
that
an
actual
executive
post
at
another
company
became
available
.

In
their
countersuit
,
they
say
that
on
two
previous
occasions
--
once
in
1987
when
they
considered
a
post
at
Columbia
,
and
once
when
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
tried
to
buy
a
stake
in
in
1988
--
Warner
was
prepared
to
release
them
from
their
contract
.

The
countersuit
also
charges
Warner
with
making
the
oral
agreement
to
``
falsely
induce
''
them
into
a
new
written
contract
in
1989
.

Moreover
,
they
say
,
Warner
is
trying
to
cheat
them
out
of
``
a
unique
business
opportunity
''
and
the
fulfilment
of
their
``
long-term
dream
''
to
run
their
own
studio
.

But
entertainment
industry
executives
say
that
the
new
contract
was
signed
after
Guber
Peters
efforts
to
take
over
MGM
failed
and
that
Warner
may
argue
in
court
that
the
producers
'
willingness
to
sign
a
new
long-term
contract
signaled
the
end
of
their
search
for
a
movie
studio
.

Mr.
Ross
and
his
team
at
Warner
appear
to
view
the
move
by
the
two
producers
to
Sony
as
a
personal
betrayal
after
years
of
support
and
friendship
.

``
Warner
has
been
nurturing
its
relationship
with
Guber
and
Peters
since
1972
,
long
before
their
recent
success
,
''
the
Warner
suit
says
.

That
success
,
the
suit
adds
,
``
is
due
in
large
measure
to
the
trust
and
confidence
that
Warner
has
reposed
in
these
producers
,
even
in
the
early
years
of
the
relationship
when
the
creative
partnership
was
not
particularly
profitable
for
Warner
.

''
Warner
,
whose
executives
are
the
highest
paid
in
the
entertainment
industry
,
also
charges
that
Sony
induced
the
two
producers
to
breach
their
Warner
contract
by
offering
them
``
the
most
lucrative
and
expensive
package
of
financial
inducements
in
the
film
industry
,
''
including
$
2.7
million
each
in
annual
salary
,
deferred
compensation
of
$
50
million
,
as
much
as
10
%
of
Columbia
's
cash
flow
,
and
as
much
as
8
%
of
the
future
appreciation
of
Columbia
's
market
value
.

The
producers
also
stand
to
get
more
than
$
50
million
from
their
combined
28
%
stake
in
Guber
Peters
Entertainment
from
Sony
's
$
200
million
offer
for
the
company
.

In
their
countersuit
,
Messrs.
Guber
and
Peters
say
they
seek
$
100
million
in
damages
initially
from
Warner
but
may
seek
a
higher
amount
later
after
determining
the
extent
of
damages
.

Advertising
agencies
'
third-quarter
earnings
are
expected
to
be
up
modestly
from
a
year
ago
,
securities
analysts
say
.

Andrew
Wallach
,
an
analyst
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
is
estimating
Interpublic
Group
,
for
example
,
at
21
cents
a
share
,
up
from
18
cents
a
share
a
year
ago
.

Greg
Ostroff
,
an
analyst
at
Goldman
Sachs
,
is
pegging
Omnicom
Group
at
17
cents
a
share
,
up
from
15
cents
a
share
,
and
Foote
,
Cone
&
Belding
Communications
Inc.
at
55
cents
a
share
,
up
from
46
cents
.

Analysts
note
,
however
,
that
the
third
period
is
a
minor
quarter
in
terms
of
absolute
profits
.

Those
who
watch
Madison
Avenue
say
this
period
,
along
with
the
first
quarter
,
is
traditionally
weak
.

The
fourth
quarter
is
where
the
real
impact
is
made
.

``
We
tend
not
to
read
much
into
third-quarter
earnings
,
''
Mr.
Ostroff
says
.

Also
notable
is
the
fact
that
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
Co.
and
WPP
Group
PLC
,
two
British
giants
that
are
principal
players
in
the
advertising
business
,
do
n't
report
quarterly
earnings
.

In
the
industry
overall
,
``
profits
will
increase
unless
revenues
are
disastrously
lower
,
''
said
Alan
Gottesman
,
an
analyst
at
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
New
York
.

``
There
are
no
external
indications
''
to
indicate
that
will
be
the
case
,
he
said
.

Mr.
Gottesman
noted
that
the
employee
count
for
the
industry
is
down
and
that
most
agencies
are
watching
staffing
levels
in
a
bid
to
closely
monitor
costs
.

Others
are
cautiously
watching
the
value
of
the
dollar
overseas
.

``
From
where
I
sit
,
the
biggest
issue
for
the
U.S.
agencies
is
the
dollar
,
''
said
Emma
Hill
,
an
analyst
at
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co.
,
New
York
.

``
For
the
U.S.
companies
,
the
risk
is
one
of
disappointment
versus
better-than-expected
because
of
the
dollar
.

''
Ad
agencies
rely
heavily
on
business
overseas
for
their
bottom
line
.

The
strength
of
the
dollar
will
hurt
the
reporting
of
foreign
earnings
,
many
analysts
said
.

Some
agencies
,
including
Interpublic
Group
's
Lintas
and
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
's
Backer
Spielvogel
Bates
,
have
said
that
their
clients
are
spending
less
than
they
had
expected
.

Few
agencies
are
reporting
that
their
clients
'
ad
budgets
are
expanding
.

All
eyes
,
however
,
are
on
the
fourth
quarter
and
to
reporting
by
the
giant
British
companies
.

``
Saatchi
&
Saatchi
is
having
a
very
tough
year
,
''
Drexel
Burnham
's
Mr.
Wallach
said
.

``
It
's
real
guesswork
figuring
out
what
they
'll
earn
.

''
That
agency
,
rumored
as
a
takeover
candidate
,
earlier
this
year
said
pretax
profit
for
1989
would
trail
1988
's
already
disappointing
level
.

For
WPP
Group
,
on
the
other
hand
,
most
analysts
are
looking
for
margin
improvement
and
good
results
considering
its
acquisition
earlier
this
year
of
Ogilvy
Group
.

The
involvement
of
units
of
two
major
U.S.
banks
in
separate
loans
to
China
has
signaled
a
growing
willingness
among
foreign
bankers
to
resume
lending
to
the
Beijing
government
.

One
of
the
units
,
BT
Asia
Ltd.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp.
,
this
week
arranged
the
syndication
of
a
$
50
million
,
five-year
loan
to
Shortridge
Ltd.
,
which
is
owned
by
China
International
Trust
&
Investment
Corp
.

(
Holdings
)
,
or
Citic
.

The
loan
will
be
used
for
Shortridge
's
share
of
the
purchase
of
a
satellite
,
a
BT
Asia
director
said
.

The
other
unit
,
Chase
Manhattan
Asia
Ltd.
,
a
Hong
Kong
subsidiary
of
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
of
New
York
,
said
it
is
underwriting
a
$
50
million
loan
for
China
's
biggest
trading
company
,
China
Resources
(
Holdings
)
Co.
,
for
general
corporate
purposes
.

Of
the
total
,
$
30
million
can
be
swapped
into
marks
.

Amid
the
international
outcry
following
the
shooting
of
students
and
bystanders
in
Beijing
on
June
4
,
foreign-bank
lending
to
China
came
to
a
halt
.

Bankers
in
Hong
Kong
said
this
week
's
Citic
loan
was
an
important
sign
that
foreign
banks
are
interested
in
resuming
regular
business
with
China
.

``
It
's
sort
of
a
benchmark
,
''
said
a
U.S.
banker
who
did
n't
participate
in
the
loan
.

Russell
L.
Magarity
,
senior
managing
director
of
Chase
Manhattan
Asia
,
said
``
it
is
time
''
to
start
considering
loans
to
China
again
.

Mr.
Magarity
said
Chase
hopes
to
assemble
an
international
group
of
banks
in
the
lending
syndicate
,
including
some
of
U.S.
and
Japanese
banks
with
which
China
Resources
has
had
a
strong
relationship
in
recent
years
.

``
Right
now
we
think
we
can
successfully
syndicate
this
loan
because
of
China
Resources
'
name
,
''
he
said
.

Indeed
,
the
reputations
of
China
Resources
and
Citic
played
a
significant
role
in
the
decisions
.

China
Resources
and
Citic
are
considered
exceptionally
good
credit
risks
,
bankers
said
.

Other
loans
to
China
will
have
to
be
considered
on
a
case-by-case
basis
.

Beyond
the
political
considerations
,
banks
are
concerned
about
the
state
of
China
's
economy
and
about
borrowers
'
ability
to
make
loan
payments
.

Now
that
the
first
major
syndication
of
a
Chinese
loan
has
proceeded
smoothly
,
a
Japanese
banker
said
it
will
be
easier
for
foreign
banks
to
consider
making
loans
to
China
.

Citic
,
which
acts
as
a
sort
of
merchant
bank
for
overseas
acquisitions
by
China
,
is
a
relatively
independent
company
.

Through
Shortridge
,
it
is
one
of
three
partners
in
Asia
Satellite
Telecommunications
Co.
,
which
plans
to
launch
a
private
satellite
on
a
Chinese
rocket
next
year
.

The
other
partners
are
Cable
&
Wireless
PLC
of
Britain
and
Hutchison
Whampoa
Ltd.
of
Hong
Kong
.

Citic
guaranteed
the
loan
.

The
loan
was
syndicated
to
a
group
of
foreign
banks
from
Europe
,
Hong
Kong
and
Canada
,
foreign
bankers
said
;
they
did
n't
identify
the
institutions
.

BT
Asia
arranged
the
syndication
but
did
n't
underwrite
the
loan
.

A
BT
Asia
official
would
n't
disclose
all
the
terms
of
the
loan
but
said
it
was
linked
to
a
currency
option
that
allows
banks
to
receive
repayment
in
yen
instead
of
dollars
.

The
official
said
Citic
will
pay
an
interest
rate
that
will
be
about
0.5
percentage
point
higher
than
the
amount
Citic
would
have
paid
for
a
similar
borrowing
before
June
4
.

He
said
it
was
difficult
to
calculate
the
exact
interest
rate
because
of
the
currency
option
.

Bankers
said
they
believe
China
Resources
'
loan
costs
have
risen
by
about
the
same
amount
.

Demand
for
products
in
the
current
quarter
should
weaken
and
inflation
should
n't
put
any
upward
pressure
on
prices
,
say
U.S.
plant
managers
in
a
Dun
&
Bradstreet
Corp.
survey
.

Fewer
plant
managers
expect
higher
new
orders
and
output
this
quarter
than
in
the
year-earlier
period
,
according
to
the
survey
,
which
polls
1,500
managers
of
manufacturing
facilities
on
conditions
in
their
factories
and
industries
.

Plant
managers
'
optimism
``
has
moderated
,
which
is
in
line
with
current
economic
data
that
indicate
slow
but
continuing
economic
growth
,
''
said
Joseph
W.
Duncan
,
corporate
economist
and
chief
statistician
for
Dun
&
Bradstreet
,
a
financial-data
company
.

The
managers
expect
materials
costs
to
drop
in
the
quarter
,
leading
fewer
to
forecast
higher
selling
prices
,
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

Dun
&
Bradstreet
calculates
several
optimism
indexes
,
subtracting
the
percentage
of
managers
expecting
a
decline
from
the
percentage
expecting
growth
.

For
overall
demand
,
the
fourth-quarter
index
fell
to
28
from
31
last
quarter
and
32
in
the
1988
fourth
period
.

For
output
,
the
index
was
29
,
the
same
as
last
quarter
,
but
a
three-point
drop
from
a
year
ago
.

For
new
orders
,
the
figure
again
was
flat
with
the
third
quarter
at
29
.

The
latest
figure
also
is
down
a
point
from
the
year
earlier
.

The
U.S.
dollar
strengthened
during
the
summer
and
may
have
damped
the
managers
'
hopes
for
higher
demand
from
overseas
.

Recent
``
declines
in
the
dollar
should
bolster
manufacturers
'
selling
opportunities
abroad
,
''
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

For
the
next
12
months
,
each
of
the
indexes
for
overall
demand
,
production
and
new
orders
fell
one
point
from
last
quarter
,
to
57
,
57
and
59
,
respectively
.

The
year-earlier
figures
were
60
,
60
and
61
.

Dun
&
Bradstreet
's
data
measuring
fourth-quarter
costs
of
making
a
single
unit
of
a
product
indicated
that
``
manufacturers
foresee
weaker
prices
''
for
materials
``
while
wage
pressures
,
though
still
present
,
are
not
expected
to
escalate
,
''
Mr.
Duncan
said
.

Bad
real
estate
loans
continued
to
gnaw
at
third-quarter
profits
of
Southwestern
banks
,
with
the
notable
exception
of
institutions
that
cleansed
their
books
with
federal
bailouts
.

``
You
've
got
a
two-tiered
market

said

W.

an

``

For

said
Thomas
Frost

As
the
only
major
bank
holding

in
Texas
to
survive
without

,
managed
only
``
very
modest
''
earnings

he
said

``
If
the
government
handed
me
a
big
bucket
of

Mr.

NCNB

Texas
operation

is
expected
to
report
an
operating

than
its
results
in
the
first
two

,
Timothy
Hartman
,
vice
chairman
of
the
Texas

,
said

The

profit
of
$
58.7

$
55.7
million

Robert

an

estimates
Houston-based
First
City
's
third-quarter
net
was
higher
than
second
quarter
earnings
of
$
28.1
million
.

However
,
he
estimated
that
per-share
earnings
stayed
``
relatively
flat
''
at
about
the
second
quarter
's
$
1.19
a
share
because
the
total
number
of
shares
outstanding
increased
.

First

was
recapitalized
last
year
by
a
group
led
by
Chicago
banker
A.
Robert
Abboud
.

The

More
recent
Texas
bailouts
wo
n't
have
much
impact
on
the
third
quarter
results
of
the
new
parent
companies
,
analysts
said
.

These
include
the
sale
of
MCorp

the

and
the
sale
of

Guaranty
Bank
of

.

The
transactions
have
n't
yet
been
completed
and
the
Texas
units
are
still
unprofitable
.

Said
Ronald
Steinhart
,

Guaranty
:
``
You

the
newly

Outside
Texas
,
the
biggest
real
estate
nightmare
for
banks
in
the
region
is
probably
Arizona
.

``
Arizona
is
going
to
be
a
mess
,
''
said
Keefe
Bruyette

Mr.
McDermott
.

Several
banks
with
operations
in
Arizona
,
including
First
Interstate
Bancorp.
and
Security
Pacific
Corp.
,
both
of
Los
Angeles
,
have
already
indicated
they
see
asset-quality
problems
.

Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
New

,
last
month
took
a
$
126

charge
against

related

Several
credit
rating
agencies
recently
downgraded
the
senior

of
Valley
National
Corp.
,
warning
that
the
Phoenix-based
bank
holding
company
is
vulnerable
to
the
deteriorating
real
estate
market
.

``
Despite
the
special
addition
to

in
the
second
quarter
,
Valley
remains
poorly
reserved
against
its
real
estate
exposure
,
''
Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
in
July
.

One
of
the
few
bright
spots
in
the
region
is
Colorado
,
where
a
mild
economic
recovery
has
helped
several
banks
staunch
the
flow
of
red
ink
.

For
instance
,
United
Banks
of
Colorado
Inc.
,
the
state
's
largest
multibank
holding
company
,
resumed
a
cash
dividend
earlier
this
year
after
recording
eight
straight
quarters
of
profitability
.

More
good
news
comes
from
New
Mexico
,
where
banks
did
n't
have
as
much
opportunity
to
get
into
difficulty
in
the
first
place
.

``
The
state
never
grew
fast
enough
to
get
banking
organizations
in
real
trouble
and
the
banking
organizations
were
never
big
enough
to
lend
into
trouble

''
said
Mr.

of
Raucher
Pierce
Refsnes
.

We
do
n't
know
who
is
winning
the
drug
war
in
Latin
America
,
but
we
know
who
's
losing
it
--
the
press
.

Over
the
past
six
months
,
six
journalists
have
been
killed
and
10
kidnapped
by
drug
traffickers
or
leftist
guerrillas
--
who
often
are
one
and
the
same
--
in
Colombia
.

Over
the
past
12
years
,
at
least
40
journalists
have
died
there
.

The
attacks
have
intensified
since
the
Colombian
government
began
cracking
down
on
the
traffickers
in
August
,
trying
to
prevent
their
takeover
of
the
country
.

The
slaughter
in
Colombia
was
very
much
on
the
minds
of
450
editors
and
publishers
from
Latin
America
,
the
United
States
,
the
Caribbean
and
Canada
attending
the
45th
general
assembly
of
the
Inter-American
Press
Association
in
Monterrey
,
Mexico
,
this
week
.

On
Tuesday
the
conference
got
word
of
another
atrocity
,
the
assassination
in
Medellin
of
two
employees
of
El
Espectador
,
Colombia
's
second-largest
newspaper
.

The
paper
's
local
administrator
,
Maria
Luz
Lopez
,
was
shot
dead
,
and
her
mother
wounded
,
while
her
car
was
stopped
for
a
red
light
.

An
hour
later
,
the
paper
's
circulation
manager
,
Miguel
Soler
,
was
shot
and
killed
near
his
home
.

The
drug
lords
who
claimed
responsibility
said
they
would
blow
up
the
Bogota
newspaper
's
offices
if
it
continued
to
distribute
in
Medellin
.

They
bombed
the
Bogota
offices
last
month
,
destroying
its
computer
and
causing
$
2.5
million
in
damage
.

El
Espectador
has
been
a
special
target
because
of
the
extraordinary
courage
of
its
publisher
and
his
staff
.

At
Monterrey
,
publisher
Luis
Gabriel
Cano
,
although
shaken
by
the
murders
,
issued
a
statement
saying
:
``
We
will
not
cease
our
fight
against
drug
trafficking
.

They
want
to
terrify
the
press
and
in
particular
El
Espectador
because
it
has
always
been
a
torchbearer
in
this
war
.

''
This
comes
from
a
man
whose
brother
,
Guillermo
,
was
murdered
in
1986
.

The
publishers
in
Monterrey
command
no
battalions
,
but
they
agreed
to
express
their
outrage
with
editorials
in
today
's
editions
.

Many
will
use
a
common
editorial
.

A
final
statement
yesterday
said
:
``
While
some
advances
are
being
made
in
nations
throughout
the
hemisphere
,
the
state
of
press
freedom
in
the
Americas
still
must
be
regarded
as
grim
as
long
as
journalists
and
their
families
are
subject
to
the
crudest
form
of
censorship
:
death
by
assassination
.

''
The
report
charged
that
Panama
's
Manuel
Noriega
is
not
only
in
league
with
the
drug
traffickers
but
also
is
bullying
the
press
as
never
before
.

``
Noriega
has
closed
every
independent
newspaper
,
radio
and
television
station
and
arrested
,
tortured
or
forced
into
exile
a
long
list
of
reporters
,
''
the
statement
declared
.

It
added
:
``
In
Cuba
,
public
enemy
No.
1
of
press
freedoms
in
the
hemisphere
,
repression
of
journalists
both
Cuban
and
foreign
is
worse
than
ever
.

''
And
in
Nicaragua
,
promises
of
press
freedom
by
the
Sandinistas
``
have
not
materialized
.

''
As
it
happens
,
the
four
countries
cited
,
Colombia
,
Cuba
,
Panama
and
Nicaragua
,
are
not
only
where
the
press
is
under
greatest
attack
but
also
are
linked
by
the
drug
trade
and
left-wing
politics
.

Noriega
is
close
to
Castro
and
may
once
have
been
his
agent
.

Sandinistas
Thomas
Borge
and
the
Ortega
brothers
are
Castro
proteges
;
he
backed
their
takeover
of
Nicaragua
.

In
Colombia
,
the
drug-financed
guerrillas
trying
to
seize
the
country
and
destroy
democracy
include
M-19
,
which
Castro
has
clearly
backed
.

Robert
Merkel
,
a
former
U.S.
attorney
handling
drug
indictments
in
Florida
,
does
n't
think
for
a
minute
that
Castro
's
much
publicized
trials
of
high
officials
engaged
in
the
drug
trade
mean
he
has
broken
off
with
the
Medellin
drug
cartel
.

``
If
the
cartel
succeeds
in
blackmailing
the
Colombian
authorities
into
negotiations
,
the
cartel
will
be
in
control
and
Fidel
can
exploit
his
past
relationships
with
them
,
''
he
told
the
Journal
's
David
Asman
recently
.

The
struggle
against
the
drug
lords
in
Colombia
will
be
a
near
thing
.

This
week
,
the
government
arrested
Jose
Abello
Silva
,
said
to
be
the
fourth-ranking
cartel
leader
.

He
will
probably
be
extradited
to
the
U.S.
for
trial
under
an
extradition
treaty
President
Virgilia
Barco
has
revived
.

Later
,
another
high-ranking
trafficker
,
Leonidas
Vargas
,
was
arrested
and
1,000
pounds
of
dynamite
seized
.

Mr.
Barco
has
refused
U.S.
troops
or
advisers
but
has
accepted
U.S.
military
aid
.

President
Bush
has
agreed
to
meet
within
90
days
with
Mr.
Barco
,
President
Alan
Garcia
of
Peru
and
President
Jaime
Paz
Zamora
of
Bolivia
to
discuss
the
drug
problem
.

It
might
not
be
a
bad
idea
to
do
that
sooner
,
rather
than
later
.

After
the
Panama
fiasco
,
they
will
need
some
reassurance
.

Certainly
,
the
Colombian
press
is
much
in
need
of
that
.

loathes

Lousy

what
she

underlying

a
more
far-reaching
change
:
For

the

gone

Back
in

1970s
,
when
malls
were
sprouting
across
the
country
,
consumers
were
content
to
browse
away
an
afternoon
and
buy
whatever
struck
their
fancy
.

Then
in
the
early
1980s
,
Americans
viewed
shopping
as
a
quest
for
the
trendiest
merchandise
or
the
best
bargains
they
could
brag
about
to
their
friends
.

Now
,
on
the
eve
of
the
1990s
,
consumer
researchers
say
that
for
most
people
,
shopping
is
simply
less
fun
.

Retailers
hawk
look-alike
merchandise
in
stores
that
are
numbingly
similar
in
appearance
.

Shopping
has
become
``
just
one
of
the
activities
that
we
have
to
do
,
''
says
Susan
Hayward
of
Yankelovich
.

``
It
's
not
an
end
in
itself
anymore
.

''
In
the
Journal
poll
,
more
than
a
third
of
the
people
interviewed
said
they
probably
would
n't
spend
a
free
hour
poking
around
in
stores
,
even
if
a
prime
shopping
district
were
nearby
.

That
is
n't
to
say
consumers
do
n't
like
new
things
.

But
when
they
go
to
a
store
today
,
they
're
more
likely
to
think
of
the
trip
as
a
mission
rather
than
an
adventure
.

``
They
're
buyers
as
opposed
to
shoppers
,
''
says
Thomas
Rauh
,
a
retail
consultant
at
the
accounting
firm
of
Ernst
&
Young
.

Surveys
and
focus-group
research
show
that
most
people
are
indeed
shopping
more
purposefully
.

Consumers
visit
fewer
stores
per
trip
(
an
average
of
three
last
year
,
down
from
3.6
in
1982
,
according
to
consultant
Stillerman
Jones
&
Co
.

)
and
spend
less
time
in
malls
(
an
average
of
68
minutes
per
trip
last
year
,
down
from
90
minutes
in
1982
)
.

``
I
leave
rather
than
hunt
for
something
,
''
snaps
Lisa
Max
,
a
46-year-old
real
estate
broker
in
New
York
.

Despite
such
negative
attitudes
,
retailers
generally
say
consumers
are
n't
cutting
back
on
what
they
buy
.

``
If
it
is
dropping
off
,
it
would
be
more
likely
that
they
're
shopping
less
often
and
buying
more
when
they
do
shop
,
''
says
Michael
Wellman
,
vice
president
of
marketing
at
K
mart
Corp
.

``
There
's
no
question
our
customers
'
time
has
become
more
valuable
than
ever
,
''
says
Stephen
Watson
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Dayton
Hudson
Corp.
's
department
store
unit
.

But
he
contends
the
company
's
record
sales
and
profits
indicate
it
is
making
the
shopping
experience
easier
.

For
example
,
the
company
is
hiring
more
sales
people
than
in
the
past
and
paying
them
more
.

It
also
is
laying
out
remodeled
and
new
stores
with
a
center-aisle
design
and
installing
escalators
and
elevators
in
more
convenient
central
locations
.

Of
course
,
there
are
still
people
for
whom
shopping
is
a
joy
,
even
a
passion
.

But
some
of
those
people
have
complaints
,
too
.

Take
Cyd
Hinman
,
a
mother
of
two
from
Norwood
,
Mass
.

She
often
enjoys
shopping
,
but
is
so
fed
up
with
the
clerks
at
a
nearby
Filene
's
department
store
that
she
refers
to
them
as
``
idiots
.

''
Twice
,
Mrs.
Hinman
picked
merchandise
off
Filene
's
racks
labeled
with
``
sale
''
signs
,
only
to
be
told
when
she
got
to
the
cash
register
that
the
goods
were
n't
on
special
.

The
second
time
,
she
demanded
that
she
receive
the
discount
anyway
,
and
the
clerk
gave
in
.

``
I
'm
willing
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
,
''
she
says
,
``
but
not
if
I
feel
like
I
'm
getting
jerked
around
.

''
Complaints
about
service
are
so
widespread
that
six
of
10
people
in
the
Journal
survey
said
they
have
boycotted
stores
because
of
the
way
they
were
treated
.

The
percentage
was
even
higher
--
roughly
three-quarters
--
among
professionals
and
those
earning
more
than
$
50,000
a
year
.

Service
has
declined
just
at
a
time
when
consumers
are
more
impatient
than
ever
.

``
The
whole
tone
of
voice
is
different
now
in
terms
of
what
people
expect
from
a
store
,
''
says
William
Ress
,
whose
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
management
consulting
firm
has
surveyed
consumers
for
more
than
20
years
.

Despite
the
rising
resentment
,
few
stores
are
making
shopping
more
appealing
.

Sales
people
spraying
perfume
still
assault
shoppers
at
many
department
stores
,
even
though
some
consumers
complain
that
the
spritzers
could
provide
a
far
more
useful
service
if
they
were
trained
to
operate
a
cash
register
.

Consumers
want
selection
to
be
easy
and
efficient
,
but
that
's
not
what
most
merchandisers
want
.

Retailers
generally
go
to
lengths
to
keep
shoppers
in
their
stores
as
long
as
possible
.

Many
stores
,
for
example
,
require
customers
to
walk
through
a
maze
of
boutiques
designed
to
show
off
their
wares
just
to
find
,
say
,
a
simple
white
blouse
.

But
rather
than
tempt
people
to
buy
more
,
consumer
researchers
say
,
this
tactic
just
irritates
many
shoppers
.

Over
half
the
respondents
in
the
Journal
survey
said
they
rarely
buy
on
impulse
anyway
.

So
what
should
a
retailer
do
?
``
Those
that
do
the
best
job
of
making
the
shopping
experience
enjoyable
and
making
the
customer
feel
like
a
human
being
are
very
well
rewarded
,
''
says
Leo
J.
Shapiro
,
a
market
researcher
in
Chicago
.

He
cites
Nordstrom
Inc.
,
the
Seattle-based
department
store
.

The
chain
's
strategy
:
pay
sales
people
an
incentive
to
provide
good
service
and
keep
more
merchandise
in
stock
than
competitors
.

Other
retailers
are
trying
to
mollify
miffed
shoppers
by
doing
away
with
their
decades-old
practice
of
setting
high
``
regular
''
prices
that
can
later
be
cut
to
``
sale
''
levels
.

Under
a
new
approach
being
hyped
as
``
everyday
low
pricing
,
''
retailers
such
as
Sears
,
Roebuck
&
Co.
now
run
fewer
sales
.

Instead
,
they
set
prices
between
their
old
``
sale
''
and
``
regular
''
prices
.

Last
month
,
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
started
promising
in
ads
that
shoppers
in
search
of
women
's
coats
could
``
cut
through
all
the
confusing
sales
,
special
buys
and
clearances
out
there
''
and
pay
what
Macy
's
says
is
the
``
lowest
prices
...
every
day
.

''
Sears
started
its
``
everyday
pricing
''
approach
in
March
,
but
so
far
sales
results
do
n't
reflect
strong
consumer
response
.

Still
,
such
a
pricing
strategy
just
might
appeal
to
people
like
Connie
Bates
,
a
respondent
in
the
Journal
survey
.

She
recently
walked
out
of
a
furniture
store
because
the
salesman
offered
to
cut
the
price
of
a
sectional
couch
three
times
.

When
a
store
keeps
dropping
prices
,
the
Farmington
,
Mich.
,
resident
says
,
``
I
get
suspicious
that
they
're
trying
to
get
the
most
they
can
out
of
you
.

Feels

Good

1989
)
The
European
Community
and
Switzerland
signed
a
treaty
granting
reciprocal
access
to
their
markets
for
most
kinds
of
insurance
products
and
services
.

The
accord
is
an
example
``
of
the
kind
of
relations
the
community
wishes
to
develop
with
its
European
partners
,
''
said
Edith
Cresson
,
the
French
minister
for
European
affairs
who
presided
over
a
recent
EC
Council
of
Ministers
meeting
.

As
European
partners
,
Mrs.
Cresson
cited
in
particular
the
members
of
the
European
Free
Trade
Association
,
composed
of
Switzerland
,
Austria
,
Sweden
,
Norway
,
Finland
and
Iceland
.

EC
and
association
ministers
are
scheduled
to
meet
Dec.
19
to
discuss
economic
cooperation
.

Mrs.
Cresson
said
she
hopes
the
talks
will
show
``
a
common
resolve
to
go
beyond
bilateral
,
sectorial
agreements
,
''
such
as
the
one
just
signed
with
Switzerland
.

Swiss
President
Jean-Pascal
Delamuraz
said
the
insurance
pact
could
``
pioneer
''
a
broader
agreement
between
the
Community
and
the
association
.

The
treaty
allows
Swiss
insurance
companies
to
open
branches
in
the
EC
,
and
vice
versa
,
without
restriction
.

But
it
does
n't
permit
selling
insurance
across
borders
without
establishing
branches
.

The
treaty
needs
to
be
approved
by
the
European
Parliament
,
which
is
expected
to
endorse
the
measure
,
EC
officials
said
.

The
agreement
,
which
had
been
16
years
in
the
making
,
covers
general-insurance
services
and
excludes
life
insurance
and
reinsurance
.

Because
Swiss
and
EC
insurers
are
widely
present
on
each
other
's
markets
,
the
accord
is
n't
expected
to
substantially
increase
near-term
competition
.

An
important
element
in
the
accord
,
EC
officials
said
,
is
a
clause
that
provides
for
bilateral
consultations
when
one
party
decides
to
modify
its
internal
insurance
legislation
.

A
joint
panel
would
decide
whether
the
changes
are
compatible
with
the
treaty
or
whether
the
treaty
needs
to
be
amended
to
cope
with
the
changes
.

Mrs.
Cresson
said
a
similar
clause
could
be
useful
in
future
accords
between
the
EC
and
other
countries
.

Chief
executive
officers
in
the
New
York
region
say
they
share
a
national
pessimism
about
the
economy
,
yet
are
bullish
on
their
own
prospects
,
according
to
a
study
of
business
executives
.

One
particularly
positive
note
in
the
study
of
chief
executives
in
the
tri-state
area
,
commissioned
by
National
Westminster
Bancorp
,
is
that
as
many
as
88
%
of
the
executives
intend
to
expand
their
businesses
or
at
least
maintain
employment
levels
in
1990
.

Employment
at
financial-related
companies
in
the
New
York
area
were
hit
hard
after
the
1987
stock
market
crash
.

The
survey
examined
the
opinions
of
550
randomly
selected
companies
in
the
New
York
metropolitan
area
--
Connecticut
,
Long
Island
,
New
York
City
,
Westchester
County
and
New
Jersey
--
with
annual
sales
between
$
5
million
and
$
250
million
.

Executives
in
the
area
have
grown
more
pessimistic
about
the
performance
of
the
national
economy
.

When
the
study
was
taken
in
1988
,
32
%
of
the
respondents
thought
the
national
economy
was
worse
that
year
than
the
year
before
,
while
in
1989
,
that
stance
was
taken
by
41
%
of
the
executives
.

The
pessimism
was
greater
among
the
larger
--
and
more
national
--
companies
.

Looking
ahead
,
the
majority
of
area
officials
expect
interest
rates
to
decline
and
inflation
to
rise
,
while
44
%
of
the
chief
executives
feel
a
recession
is
likely
by
the
end
of
On
the
regional
level
,
executives
had
less
good
news
to
report
about
their
own
businesses
.

Only
49
%
of
the
executives
reported
improved
company
performance
this
year
,
down
from
the
60
%
in
the
1988
study
.

Predictably
,
the
year
ahead
looks
brighter
;
63
%
of
the
executives
anticipate
better
company
performance
in
1990
,
while
only
10
%
envision
a
decline
.

A
good
sign
for
the
long-term
health
of
the
region
is
that
chief
executives
were
generally
``
quite
satisfied
''
with
the
region
as
a
business
place
,
saying
its
benefits
consistently
outweigh
drawbacks
.

Highest
marks
went
to
the
availability
of
professional
business
services
,
which
51
%
of
the
executives
consider
the
top
benefit
.

The
local
marketplace
and
availability
of
professional
employees
also
were
ranked
high
.

Among
major
drawbacks
to
the
region
,
63
%
consider
the
level
of
state
taxes
at
the
top
of
the
list
,
followed
by
54
%
who
had
the
same
opinion
on
local
taxes
.

Coming
in
third
,
40
%
said
it
was
the
cost
of
non-professional
employees
.

On
questions
of
employment
,
40
%
of
the
executives
increased
their
work
force
since
last
year
,
and
44
%
expect
to
expand
next
year
.

Only
9
%
reduced
their
payrolls
in
the
past
year
.

For
the
second
year
in
a
row
,
New
Jersey
was
rated
as
the
region
's
most
desirable
place
to
do
business
.

Among
all
of
the
executives
surveyed
who
would
consider
a
move
,
50
%
would
look
at
New
Jersey
,
compared
with
an
average
23
%
who
would
consider
other
states
in
the
region
.

In
one
of
the
highest
degrees
of
loyalty
shown
in
the
study
,
of
those
New
Jersey
executives
considering
a
move
,
74
%
would
stay
within
the
state
.

But
one-fourth
of
the
state
's
executives
listed
transportation
problems
as
a
drawback
.

Chief
executives
in
New
York
City
showed
a
noticeably
high
expectation
of
improved
company
performance
in
the
next
year
.

In
New
York
,
75
%
of
the
executives
predict
their
companies
'
performance
will
improve
in
1990
,
compared
with
an
average
of
63
%
from
chief
executives
from
the
other
locales
who
feel
the
same
way
.

Westchester
executives
reflected
the
most
bullish
prospects
for
employment
.

More
companies
in
Westchester
than
any
other
location
have
increased
the
number
of
their
employees
in
the
past
year
.

In
1990
,
Westchester
chief
executives
lead
the
way
in
plans
to
increase
their
number
of
employees
.

In
Westchester
,
51
%
of
the
executives
anticipate
hiring
more
,
while
in
Long
Island
that
number
was
39
%
and
in
Connecticut
42
%
.

Cummins
Engine
Co.
shares
dropped
yesterday
after
the
company
disclosed
it
will
have
to
correct
defects
in
pistons
installed
in
some
of
its
engines
.

In
a
terse
release
,
the
maker
of
diesel
engines
,
parts
and
power
systems
said
it
has
``
identified
a
problem
''
with
pistons
used
in
its
model
K
and
KV
diesels
since
May
1
.

The
high-horsepower
motors
are
used
in
heavy
applications
such
as
construction
and
mining
equipment
.

Cummins
said
the
problem
relates
to
recent
modifications
in
the
design
of
a
piston
it
buys
from
an
outside
supplier
.

None
of
the
engines
have
failed
to
date
,
said
a
spokeswoman
,
adding
that
the
defect
does
n't
represent
a
hazard
.

The
company
would
n't
identify
the
supplier
,
nor
would
it
say
how
many
of
the
defective
engines
it
has
produced
.

A
spokeswoman
noted
,
however
,
that
such
engines
represented
only
2.5
%
of
the
company
's
overall
production
in
the
first
six
months
of
the
year
.

The
company
said
it
will
replace
all
pistons
in
the
affected
engines
,
and
as
a
result
,
will
``
supplement
K
and
KV
warranty
accruals
.

''
The
spokeswoman
declined
to
say
how
much
money
the
company
will
have
to
spend
on
the
repairs
;
the
company
recently
halted
production
of
the
models
until
replacement
pistons
are
available
Oct.
16
.

In
composite
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
yesterday
,
Cummins
shares
stumbled
$
2
to
close
at
$
52
.

The
company
's
shares
traded
as
high
as
$
64
last
month
,
before
Cummins
disclosed
in
late
September
that
it
expects
to
report
a
``
substantial
''
third-quarter
loss
because
of
deteriorating
demand
and
other
difficulties
.

Major
steel
companies
,
stung
by
soft
demand
from
car
makers
and
eroding
prices
,
are
expected
to
report
that
third-quarter
operating
profits
plummeted
to
possibly
the
lowest
levels
in
two
years
.

``
This
will
be
the
worst
quarter
since
the
third
quarter
of
1987
,
when
steel
companies
were
just
on
their
way
up
,
''
predicted
John
Tumazos
,
an
analyst
with
Donaldson
,
Lufkin
&
Jenrette
Securities
Corp
.

The
fourth
quarter
could
be
even
more
dismal
.

``
We
are
in
the
midst
of
a
very
severe
price
drop
that
will
really
hit
in
the
fourth
quarter
,
''
said
Peter
Marcus
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

A
rebound
in
those
prices
is
expected
sometime
after
the
winter
of
1990
.

After
enjoying
a
24-month
honeymoon
of
full
production
,
rising
prices
and
lower
costs
,
steelmakers
are
facing
declining
volume
from
disappointing
automotive
,
appliance
and
even
capital
goods
markets
.

The
consensus
is
that
major
steelmakers
earned
between
$
30
and
$
35
for
each
ton
of
steel
shipped
,
compared
with
$
49
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
.

The
latest
quarter
is
also
down
from
the
$
51
a
ton
earned
in
the
second
quarter
,
when
the
industry
benefited
from
modest
price
increases
and
lower
raw
material
costs
.

Mr.
Marcus
expects
fourth-quarter
profits
to
drop
to
about
$
25
a
ton
.

Along
with
lackluster
sales
to
car
makers
--
their
largest
customer
--
steelmakers
are
losing
shipments
to
their
second
largest
customer
,
steel
service
centers
,
which
are
trying
to
reduce
inventories
.

The
Steel
Service
Center
Institute
reported
in
September
that
72
%
of
its
members
believe
inventories
were
``
too
high
,
''
with
65
%
planning
to
reduce
those
levels
during
the
next
six
months
.

Christopher
Plummer
,
an
analyst
with
WEFA
Group
,
noted
that
the
capital
goods
market
,
which
had
been
stronger
than
automotive
and
appliance
markets
,
is
showing
signs
of
weakness
as
well
.

Companies
,
concerned
about
the
economy
and
trying
to
slash
their
own
costs
,
are
backing
off
capital
improvement
programs
,
he
said
.

Overall
,
second-half
steel
shipments
are
expected
to
drop
about
15
%
to
36
million
or
37
million
tons
,
which
some
analysts
say
could
cost
the
industry
$
700
million
in
lost
income
.

Two
companies
,
in
particular
,
were
hurt
by
unusual
events
in
the
third
quarter
.

Bethlehem
Steel
Corp.
,
the
nation
's
second
largest
steelmaker
,
was
hampered
by
wildcat
coal
strikes
,
a
spot
strike
at
its
freight
car
operation
and
blast
furnace
problems
at
its
crown
jewel
Sparrows
Point
plant
.

Charles
Bradford
,
an
analyst
with
Merrill
Lynch
Capital
Markets
,
predicts
Bethlehem
earnings
dropped
more
than
two-thirds
to
about
50
cents
a
share
,
from
$
2.35
a
year
ago
,
excluding
major
nonrecurring
items
.

National
Steel
Corp.
,
the
nation
's
sixth
largest
steel
company
,
predicted
at
the
beginning
of
1989
that
the
third
quarter
would
be
its
best
.

However
,
an
initial
rejection
by
steelworkers
of
a
new
labor
accord
sent
nervous
National
Steel
customers
scrambling
for
alternative
suppliers
.

Moreover
,
National
Steel
is
tied
closely
to
the
sluggish
automobile
industry
.

One
other
factor
for
some
steelmakers
:
higher
costs
associated
with
new
labor
contracts
.

Inland
Steel
Industries
Inc.
,
which
recently
negotiated
an
accord
that
calls
for
immediate
and
significant
wage
increases
,
is
expected
to
see
earnings
drop
to
less
than
$
1
a
share
from
$
1.70
a
year
earlier
because
of
the
pact
,
as
well
as
disappointments
in
its
steel
service
center
operations
.

About
the
only
major
steelmaker
expected
to
post
improved
results
is
USX
Corp.
,
which
once
again
will
post
gains
from
asset
sales
.

Many
analysts
initially
raised
earnings
forecasts
for
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
as
a
result
of
the
coming
sale
of
reserves
from
its
Texas
Oil
&
Gas
unit
.

The
expected
$
1
billion-plus
proceeds
are
expected
to
be
used
to
reduce
debt
and
buy
back
shares
.

One
wild
card
in
USX
's
future
earnings
is
investor
Carl
Icahn
,
who
boosted
his
stake
in
USX
and
is
urging
more
restructuring
.

Recent
order
rates
indicate
that
the
fourth
quarter
,
a
time
shipments
usually
pick
up
,
will
be
weak
as
well
.

Merrill
Lynch
's
Mr.
Bradford
said
,
``
We
have
n't
seen
the
pickup
in
flat
rolled
orders
that
we
should
have
.

''
Flat
rolled
steel
is
the
industry
's
major
product
.

Typically
,
steelmakers
would
look
to
the
export
market
to
unload
excess
capacity
.

But
that
market
is
hurting
as
well
.

PaineWebber
noted
that
the
world
steel
export
price
of
cold-rolled
steel
has
dropped
to
$
460
to
$
480
a
metric
ton
from
a
high
of
$
560
this
spring
.

Moreover
,
the
relative
strength
of
the
dollar
and
lower
world
prices
may
result
in
increased
sales
in
the
U.S.
by
foreign
producers
offering
lower
prices
.

There
are
some
bright
spots
for
the
industry
.

The
service
center
association
reports
that
shipments
were
up
in
August
,
indicating
a
resurgence
in
demand
for
carbon
flat
rolled
and
stainless
steel
products
.

John
Jacobson
,
an
analyst
with
AUS
Consultants
,
also
said
he
believes
steel
production
costs
are
coming
down
because
of
increased
efficiencies
at
major
mills
.

I
was
profoundly
moved
by
the
incongruity
of
modern
American
life
illustrated
by
your
Sept.
20
page-one
article
``
Country
Doctor
:
How
a
Physician
Solved
Riddle
of
Rare
Disease
in
Children
of
Amish
.

''
Here
is
a
young
man
who
honestly
understands
what
being
a
physician
means
and
what
it
requires
.

It
requires
delivering
quality
medical
care
to
those
in
need
.

It
requires
doing
the
utmost
within
oneself
to
alleviate
the
illness
and
suffering
of
others
.

The
physician
providing
such
care
derives
his
reward
from
being
fulfilled
as
a
provider
,
and
from
realistic
charges
for
his
care
.

Though
Holmes
Morton
fulfills
the
``
requirements
''
for
being
a
true
physician
,
our
so-called
sophisticated
society
and
its
medical
system
fail
to
appreciate
the
value
of
such
a
dedicated
physician
.

Otherwise
,
why
is
there
not
a
rush
of
funds
from
medical
circles
or
the
related
medical-support
industry
--
i.e.
pharmaceutical
companies
,
etc.
--
or
,
most
significantly
,
from
all
of
us
to
support
this
doctor
and
his
patients
,
to
support
a
clinic
to
further
the
work
of
resolving
human
suffering
?
Ted
Ferrier
Jr

Dallas
Having
grown
up
among
the
Amish
in
Iowa
,
I
think
I
can
appreciate
more
than
most
the
difficulty
of
Dr.
Morton
's
work
.

The
average
person
can
hardly
imagine
the
suspicion
,
bred
by
centuries
of
isolation
and
persecution
,
among
the
Amish
toward
outsiders
and
things
modern
.

This
,
in
my
experience
,
is
particularly
true
of
their
attitude
toward
modern
medicine
.

Dr.
Morton
's
success
is
not
only
a
measure
of
the
outstanding
quality
of
his
work
,
but
also
of
the
desperation
the
Amish
must
feel
in
the
face
of
this
horrendous
disease
.

Sadly
,
the
article
also
contains
a
profound
statement
about
the
current
state
of
academe
,
the
professions
in
particular
and
American
society
in
general
.

Some
experts
were
quoted
as
speculating
on
the
detrimental
effects
of
Dr.
Morton
's
work
on
his
career
.

According
to
these
experts
,
he
will
find
it
difficult
to
get
grants
and
will
lose
access
to
sophisticated
laboratories
.

They
point
out
that
he
``
will
be
,
at
best
,
on
the
very
outer
circle
.

''
As
a
marginal
academic
myself
,
I
thought
we
were
at
least
discreet
enough
to
keep
our
real
concerns
hidden
behind
our
academic
robes
and
in
our
faculty
cliques
.

We
can
only
hope
that
more
people
will
choose
to
be
``
on
the
very
outer
circle

such
like

about

about

whose

all
of
which
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
as

have
a
woeful
sense
of

and
give
no
thought
to
what
``

''
Here
is
an
individual
to
be
greatly
admired
and
respected
.

Sandro
Mayer
Fishkill
,
N.Y
.

Owens-Corning
Fiberglas
Corp.
said
it
expects
to
report
that
third-quarter
operating
profit
fell
``
substantially
''
from
a
year
earlier
,
when
the
maker
of
insulation
,
roofing
and
plastic
materials
had
profit
before
extraordinary
items
of
$
1.36
a
share
.

In
a
prepared
statement
,
the
company
said
the
decline
``
reflects
reduced
activity
in
construction
,
marine
and
transportation
markets
.

''
An
Owens-Corning
spokesman
said
the
company
still
expects
to
post
net
income
for
the
just-ended
third
quarter
but
he
declined
to
be
more
specific
.

He
also
declined
to
comment
on
expectations
for
the
fourth
quarter
.

Owens-Corning

a
share
,
down
$

,
in
New

Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
following
the
news
.

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
Owens-Corning
had
profit
from
continuing
operations
of
$
57
million
.

A
charge
of
$
6
million
,
or
15
cents
a
share
,
related
to
the
purchase
of
company
debt
made
net
$
51
million
,
or
$
1.21
a
share
.

Sales
in
the
1988
third
quarter
totaled
$
760
million
.

The
spokesman
said
the
problems
in
the
construction
market
relate
mainly
to
``
reduced
volume
in
insulation
and
roofing
,
especially
reroofing
and
commercial
roofing
products
.

''
He
said
roof
repairs
were
relatively
strong
in
Texas
and
should
be
strong
in
the
Southeast
during
the
fourth
quarter
as
home
and
building
owners
repair
property
damaged
by
Hurricane
Hugo
.

``
But
nationally
,
based
on
trends
so
far
this
year
,
we
expect
{
that
segment
}
to
remain
weak
over
all
,
''
he
said
.

The
spokesman
said
sales
of
reinforced-fiberglass
material
to
the
boat-building
industry
also
were
weak
,
largely
because
of
softening
in
the
marine
market
.

Weakness
in
the
auto
industry
also
is
expected
to
continue
through
the
rest
of
the
year
.

Car
and
truck
production
was
strong
earlier
this
year
,
but
expectations
of
slower
sales
in
the
fourth
quarter
have
cut
manufacturers
'
output
forecasts
.

However
,
Owens-Corning
was
able
to
offset
that
decline
somewhat
with
new
business
at
General
Motors
Corp.
,
which
recently
introduced
a
new
,
plastic-body
van
.

Owens-Corning
expects
to
post
third-quarter
results
by
the
end
of
next

the
spokesman
said
.

we

As
India
gears
up
for
general
elections
to
be
held
by
January
,
television
is
emerging
as
a
powerful
political
tool
--
and
a
highly
controversial
one
.

Television
is
beamed
into
74
%
of
the
country
's
villages
,
up
from
49
%
during
the
1984
general-election
campaign
.

The
government
hopes
to
get
broadcasts
into
all
of
India
's
57,500
villages
eventually
.

But
the
government
is
essentially
the
only
broadcaster
.

It
controls
the
sole
national
TV
network
,
Doordarshan
,
and
the
only
national
radio
system
,
All
India
Radio
.

TV
news
coverage
has
generally
favored
the
government
.

In
recent
months
,
however
,
critics
say
the
coverage
has
been
so
biased
toward
Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
and
his
ruling
Congress
(
I
)
Party
that
what
is
labeled
news
is
merely
propaganda
.

With
the
elections
approaching
,
critics
say
the
manipulation
of
such
an
influential
medium
poses
a
threat
to
India
's
democratic
traditions
.

``
In
a
country
with
our
measure
of
literacy
,
television
is
becoming
a
serious
impediment
in
the
way
of
free
and
fair
elections

''
says
Lal
Krishna
Advani
,
an
opposition-party
leader
and
a
former
minister
of

broadcasting

``
It
tilts
the
balance
totally
in

ruling
party

''
But
Kamal
Kant
Tewary

minister
for
information

broadcasting
,
says
:
``
We
are
the

,
and
we
will

whatever
we

There
is

agreement
on
one
point
:
The
elections
are
likely
to
be
the
most
uncertain
since
1967
.

Many
say
Mr.
Gandhi
and
Congress
(
I
)
,
with
seesawing
popularity
and
an
arms
scandal
that
has
tarnished
the
government
,
stand
a
chance
of
losing
power
.

The
arms
scandal
involves
a
report
by
India
's
comptroller
and
auditor
general
,
which
cited
lapses
in
the
government
's
evaluation
and
purchase
of
artillery
guns
from
a
Swedish
arms
company
.

Television
came
to
India
in
1965
,
when
black-and-white
broadcasts
began
in
New
Delhi
.

Broadcasts
to
other
cities
did
n't
start
until
1972
,
and
color
broadcasts
debuted
just
seven
years
ago
.

In
1980
,
the
country
had
1.6
million
TV
sets
;
today
there
are
20
million
.

That
's
a
small
number
for
a
nation
of
800
million
people
,
but
a
single
set
might
have
much
of
a
village
for
its
audience
.

A
sizable
portion
of
illiterate
Indians
now
rely
on
television
for
news
they
used
to
hear
third
or
fourth
hand
,
if
at
all
.

Doordarshan
is
controlled
by
the
Ministry
of
Information
and
Broadcasting
and
often
takes
orders
directly
from
the
prime
minister
's
office
,
some
Doordarshan
staff
members
contend
.

According
to
critics
,
the
shift
in
Doordarshan
's
news
coverage
from
generally
favoring
the
government
to
outright
bias
began
in
May
.

From
around
that
time
,
the
critics
say
,
items
on
Mr.
Gandhi
and
Congress
(
I
)
have
increasingly
dominated
the
nationwide
evening
news
and
have
been
overwhelmingly
positive
,
while
the
opposition
has
been
given
short
shrift
or
blatantly
abused
.

In
May
,
a
Doordarshan
news
bulletin
quoted
excerpts
from
a
newspaper
article
by
an
opposition
leader
.

The
article
criticized
both
the
government
and
the
opposition
,
but
Doordarshan
aired
only
the
parts
criticizing
the
opposition
.

This
was
merely
news
judgment
,
says
Mr.
Tewary
,
the
information
and
broadcasting
minister
.

In
the
same
month
,
a
group
of
politicians
circulated
a
photo
of
a
top
opposition
leader
,
Ajit
Singh
,
socializing
with
an
alleged
drug
smuggler
.

Newspapers
carried
the
photo
on
their
front
pages
.

Doordarshan
showed
it
on
the
nationwide
news
broadcast
.

The
next
day
,
a
different
group
of
politicians
produced
a
photo
of
Mr.
Gandhi
standing
next
to
the
same
alleged
drug
smuggler
.

Newspapers
again
gave
it
front-page
play
.

Doordarshan
ignored
it
.

Mr.
Tewary
says
the
prime
minister
is
photographed
with
many
people
and
that
therefore
the
photograph
was
n't
news
.

But
a
senior
reporter
at
All
India
Radio
,
who
declines
to
be
identified
,
says
:
``
We
get
orders
from
a
chain
of
people
.

We
are
a
government
news
agency
and
are
expected
to
project
the
government
.

''
For
all
the
criticism
of
what
is
seen
as
government
propaganda
,
many
media
experts
say
it
could
be
counterproductive
.

Says
Probhat
Chandra
Chatterji
,
one
of
the
pioneers
of
Indian
broadcasting
and
a
former
director-general
of
All
India
Radio
and
Doordarshan
:
``
It
is
debatable
whether
this
propaganda
will
bring
votes
to
the
government
.

By
and
large
,
people
think
that
it
will
turn
the
people
away
.

''
Troubled
British
defense
contractor
Ferranti
International
Signal
PLC
replaced
the
head
of
its
scandal-plagued
U.S.
division
.

Ferranti
said
Joseph
Zilligen
,
49
years
old
,
chairman
of
Ferranti
International
USA
,
is
``
relinquishing
''
his
post
.

Succeeding
him
as
chairman
of
the
large
,
Lancaster
,
Pa.-based
unit
,
is
a
longtime
Ferranti
executive
,
Albert
Dodd
.

Mr.
Dodd
,
a
53-year-old
Briton
,
is
a
Ferranti
board
member
and
managing
director
of
Ferranti
's
instrumentation
division
.

The
U.S.
unit
is
at
the
center
of
what
Ferranti
has
called
a
``
serious
fraud
''
that
has
rocked
the
British
company
for
the
past
month
.

Ferranti
acquired
the
U.S.
business
last
year
,
in
a
merger
with
the
then
International
Signal
&
Control
Group
An
International
Signal
unit
,
according
to
Ferranti
,
reported
on
its
books
#
215
million
(
$
332.5
million
)
of
weapons
contracts
that
did
n't
exist
.

The
falsified
figures
inflated
International
Signal
's
reported
assets
,
and
increased
the
price
Ferranti
paid
when
it
bought
the
company
,
according
to
Ferranti
officials
.

Mr.
Zilligen
's
departure
is
the
latest
fallout
from
the
scandal
.

Ferranti
has
said
it
expects
an
accounting
correction
that
would
eliminate
nearly
half
its
reported
net
worth
,
and
it
's
seeking
a
buyer
to
repair
its
finances
.

British
Aerospace
PLC
and
France
's
Thomson-CSF
S.A.
are
leading
contenders
for
a
joint
Ferranti
bid
.

Yesterday
,
a
London
brokerage
firm
,
Hoare
Govett
Ltd.
,
confirmed
that
it
purchased
on
Wednesday
5.7
million
Ferranti
shares
at
56
pence
(
87
cents
)
apiece
on
behalf
of
British
Aerospace
.

The
purchase
boosts
the
British
Aerospace-Thomson
stake
to
12.98
million
shares
,
or
1.7
%
of
the
stock
outstanding
.

A
Ferranti
spokesman
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
management
shuffle
is
related
to
the
financial
scandal
,
but
called
it
generally
part
of
the
``
integration
''
of
International
Signal
into
Ferranti
since
the
1988
merger
.

He
said
Mr.
Zilligen
remains
a
Ferranti
director
,
but
will
also
be
succeeded
by
Mr.
Dodd
as
chief
executive
of
Ferranti
Italia
.

Mr.
Zilligen
,
through
a
spokesman
in
Lancaster
,
declined
to
comment
.

The
executive
was
a
colleague
since
1980
of
International
Signal
founder
James
Guerin
,
who
left
International
Signal
and
Ferranti
last
spring
.

Roy
S.
MacDowell
Jr.
,
founder
of
MacDowell
Co.
,
a
construction
and
site-development
concern
,
was
named
a
director
of
this
bank
holding
company
,
expanding
the
board
to
seven
members
.

The
dollar
drifted
lower
in
indecisive
trading
,
its
strength
sapped
by
concern
that
the
Federal
Reserve
is
gently
easing
monetary
policy
.

Despite
reserve-draining
operations
by
the
Fed
yesterday
and
on
the
three
preceding
business
days
,
some
analysts
say
the
central
bank
is
subtly
relaxing
credit
.

They
say
the
Fed
's
draining
operations
have
been
necessary
to
address
a
seasonal
surfeit
of
reserves
,
but
note
that
the
actions
have
n't
been
tough
enough
to
prevent
the
federal
funds
rate
from
easing
to
about
8
%
from
its
recent
level
of
9
%
.

The
federal
funds
rate
is
the
overnight
rate
banks
charge
each
other
.

``
They
're
draining
in
a
consistently
less
aggressive
manner
and
at
a
lower
level
,
''
said
James
T.
McGroarty
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Greenwich
Capital
Markets
.

But
others
analysts
say
opinion
differs
markedly
on
whether
the
Fed
is
softening
its
credit
stance
,
noting
that
the
market
's
muted
reaction
reflects
this
division
.

``
We
just
do
n't
know
enough
yet
to
definitively
say
that
the
Fed
has
eased
...
the
fed
funds
rate
still
is
in
a
band
around
9
%
,
''
said
one
economist
.

Speculation
that
the
Fed
would
sharply
ease
its
credit
reins
was
damped
earlier
this
week
when
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
said
central
banks
should
n't
focus
too
much
on
intermediate
goals
for
exchange
rates
and
interest
rates
.

In
late
New
York
trading
Thursday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.9083
marks
,
down
from
1.9166
marks
late
Wednesday
,
and
at
144.17
yen
,
down
from
144.57
yen
late
Wednesday
.

Sterling
was
quoted
at
$
1.5523
,
up
from
$
1.5463
.

In
Tokyo
Friday
,
the
U.S.
currency
opened
for
trading
at
143.60
yen
,
down
from
Thursday
's
Tokyo
close
of
144.60
yen
.

Many
foreign
exchange
traders
remain
skeptical
that
a
credit-softening
is
in
the
offing
.

They
plan
to
look
for
clues
in
two
economic
indicators
due
out
today
,
one
on
the
producer-price
index
and
the
other
on
retail
sales
,
both
for
September
.

``
The
market
believes
PPI
will
confirm
Greenspan
's
concern
about
inflation
,
''
said
Francoise
Soares-Kemp
,
a
vice
president
with
Credit
Suisse
in
New
York
.

She
said
the
market
has
already
reacted
to
``
that
particular
prompting
''
and
is
unlikely
to
bid
the
dollar
significantly
higher
.

Higher
energy
and
auto
prices
are
expected
to
have
pushed
producer
prices
up
0.3
%
in
September
after
declining
in
August
and
July
.

Retail
sales
are
expected
to
have
remained
flat
in
September
,
according
to
economists
,
following
gains
of
0.7
%
in
August
and
0.5
%
in
July
.

A
long-awaited
speech
by
British
Chancellor
of
the
Exchequer
Nigel
Lawson
failed
to
bolster
the
flagging
pound
and
left
many
market
participants
with
a
decidedly
bearish
view
of
sterling
.

Vowing
to
continue
his
government
's
strategy
of
combating
inflation
with
high
interest
rates
,
Mr.
Lawson
told
the
Conservative
Party
conference
that
the
battle
to
rein
in
inflation
required
a
strong
currency
.

The
Tories
are
``
not
the
party
of
devaluation
,
''
he
said
.

But
Mr.
Lawson
failed
to
outline
specific
policy
changes
or
say
how
the
British
government
planned
to
support
the
beleaguered
pound
.

He
also
avoided
any
mention
of
when
London
would
bring
sterling
into
the
exchange
rate
mechanism
of
the
European
Monetary
System
,
and
warned
there
are
``
no
easy
answers
''
to
Britain
's
economic
problems
.

Some
market
analysts
see
early
entry
into
the
EMS
exchange
rate
mechanism
as
one
of
the
few
alternatives
left
for
stabilizing
the
pound
.

But
entry
has
been
opposed
by
Prime
Minister
Thatcher
,
who
insists
Britain
should
join
from
a
position
of
strength
.

Wednesday
's
discount
rate
increase
in
Japan
continued
to
dominate
trading
in
Tokyo
,
with
dealers
trying
to
guess
what
the
Bank
of
Japan
and
the
Fed
will
do
following
the
failure
of
the
rate
boost
to
depress
the
dollar
.

The
Bank
of
Japan
entered
the
market
several
times
in
the
morning
to
sell
dollars
for
yen
,
traders
said
.

European
dealings
were
dominated
by
cross
activity
,
highlighted
by
sterling
.

On
the
Commodity
Exchange
in
New
York
,
gold
for
current
delivery
settled
at
$
363.40
an
ounce
,
up
$
1.40
.

Estimated
volume
was
a
light
2.2
million
ounces
.

In
early
trading
in
Hong
Kong
Friday
,
gold
was
quoted
at
$
363.35
an
ounce
.

COASTAL
Corp.
said
it
completed
the
public
offering
of
9.2
million
common
shares
and
$
200
million
of
15-year
senior
debentures
.

The
diversified
Houston
energy
concern
said
combined
proceeds
of
about
$
580.6
million
will
be
used
to
retire
and
refinance
outstanding
debt
.

Underwriters
for
the
offerings
included
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
and
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc

Gordon
A.
Paris
,
36
years

was

director
in
charge

division

the
corporate
restructuring
group
,
at
this
investment
banking
and
brokerage

In
April
,
Mr.
Paris
joined
Kidder
from
General
Electric
Capital

,
where
he
was
a
vice

Kidder

Tokyo
stocks
fell
sharply
as
the
dollar
remained
strong
despite
Wednesday
's
half-point
discount
rate
increase
by
the
Bank
of
Japan
.

London
shares
recovered
some
lost
ground
,
largely
on
technical
factors
as
Chancellor
Nigel
Lawson
's
speech
to
the
Conservative
Party
conference
was
viewed
as
basically
neutral
for
the
market
.

Tokyo
's
Nikkei
Index
of
225
issues
,
which
fell
136.28
points
Wednesday
,
closed
at
34795.05
,
down
445.02
.

The
decline
of
nearly
1.3
%
left
the
index
below
35000
for
the
first
time
since
Sept.
25
.

In
the
first
hour
of
trading
in
Tokyo
Friday
,
the
Nikkei
Index
rose
145.96
points
to
34941.01
.

Thursday
's
volume
on
the
first
section
was
estimated
at
650
million
shares
,
compared
with
751
million
Wednesday
.

Declining
issues
outpaced
advancers
857-161
,
with
110
unchanged
.

The
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
of
all
issues
in
the
first
section
,
which
lost
13.07
Wednesday
,
was
down
36.89
,
or
1.4
%
,
to
2623.60
.

The
market
opened
at
what
proved
to
be
its
high
and
continued
to
slip
toward
the
end
of
the
day
.

Traders
said
the
reason
its
drop
was
larger
than
Wednesday
's
moderate
loss
was
that
investors
began
selling
their
holdings
when
they
saw
that
Wednesday
's
rise
to
3.75
%
in
the
discount
rate
--
the
central
bank
's
base
rate
on
loans
to
commercial
banks
--
failed
to
curb
the
dollar
's
rise
against
the
yen
.

A
stronger
dollar
concerns
Japanese
stock
investors
because
it
contributes
to
Japanese
inflation
,
particularly
by
raising
oil
and
other
energy
and
natural
resource
prices
,
which
are
denominated
in
dollars
.

In
addition
,
higher
prices
for
imports
allow
domestic
manufacturers
to
increase
their
own
prices
.

Moreover
,
the
current
high
level
of
the
U.S.
stock
market
,
and
the
possibility
of
U.S.
interest
rates
being
cut
or
Japanese
rates
being
raised
again
to
keep
the
dollar
down
,
might
draw
funds
currently
invested
in
Japanese
equities
into
the
U.S.
market
,
some
investors
fear
.

Masami
Okuma
,
senior
trader
at
UBS
Phillips
&
Drew
International
,
said
expectations
of
another
increase
in
the
discount
rate
already
are
causing
some
investors
not
only
to
stop
buying
but
also
to
dump
some
of
their
recently
acquired
shares
.

Yoshiaki
Mitsuoka
,
manager
of
the
investment
information
department
at
Daiwa
Investment
Trust
&
Management
Co.
,
said
the
market
had
been
sustained
recently
by
smaller
issues
with
relatively
low
price-earnings
ratios
.

Prices
of
such
shares
,
he
said
,
now
have
risen
an
average
of
57
%
in
the
past
six
months
,
making
them
less
attractive
for
fresh
buying
.

Yukio
Itagaki
,
director
of
the
fund
management
department
at
Kokusai
Investment
Trust
Management
Co.
,
said
the
discount
rate
increase
did
n't
have
much
effect
on
the
actual
market
environment
,
as
short-term
interest
rates
already
had
been
above
5
%
.

And
as
the
rate
on
newly
issued
three-month
certificates
of
deposit
went
up
to
6.2
%
Wednesday
,
institutions
and
corporations
had
little
incentive
to
invest
new
funds
in
stocks
.

The
higher
discount
rate
discouraged
institutions
from
holding
steel
and
construction
shares
,
traders
said
.

Nippon
Steel
fell
10
to
698
yen
(
$
4.83
)
a
share
,
Sumitomo
Metal
lost
19
to
677
,
and
Kobe
Steel
was
down
9
at
690
.

Kajima
was
down
100
at
1,900
,
while
Ohbayashi
lost
60
to
1,500
.

Shipbuilding
issues
also
were
sold
off
.

Kawasaki
Heavy
Industries
fell
37
to
903
,
and
Mitsubishi
Heavy
Industries
was
down
30
at
1,010
.

Among
housing
issues
,
Misawa
Homes
lost
140
to
2,830
,
Sekisui
House
declined
70
to
2,400
,
and
Daiwa
House
lost
100
to
2,470
.

Retail
issues
,
which
advanced
in
September
on
speculation
about
mergers
and
acquisitions
in
the
sector
,
were
sold
on
profit-taking
,
traders
said
.

Seiyu
was
down

Some
of

Among
the
few
winners
was
Sharp
,
which
attracted
investors
because
of
growing
demand

Chancellor
Lawson

who
has
been
under
political
fire
for
his
decision
a
week
ago
to
force
U.K.

'
base
lending
rates
up
to
15
%
,
an
eight-year
high
,
addressed
the
governing
Conservatives
'
annual
conference
on
current
economic
issues
,
and
dealers
said
the
speech
was
exactly
what
the
market
had
expected
.

``
It
was
a
good
party
political
conference
speech
,
''
a
dealer
with
a
large
U.K.
market-making
operation
said
.

``
He
did
n't
calm
any
fears
or
anxieties
,
but
at
least
he
did
n't
create
any
new
ones
.

''
Dealers
attributed
the
day
's
advances
largely
to
a
technical
rebound
from
the
sharp
declines
that
followed
last
week
's
base-rate
increase
.

They
also
cited
markdowns
by
market-makers
seeking
to
generate
some
business
and
a
general
absence
of
active
selling
.

There
was
also
some
speculative
energy
that
helped
to
support

FT-SE
100
later
in

,
when
Wall
Street
showed
signs
of
weakness
early
in
its
trading
day
.

That
energy
came
in
part
from
renewed
rumors
that
U.S.
takeover
specialists
Kohlberg
Kravis
Roberts
are
preparing
to
make
a
takeover
bid
for
industrial
concern
BTR
rather
than
simply
take
a
15
%
stake
in
it
.

Dealers
also
pointed
to
active
options
dealing
in
the
stock
recently
and
said
some
of
the
options
had
been
exercised
.

Here

price
trends
on

's
major
stock

as
calculated

.

To
make
them
directly
comparable
,
each
index
is
based
on
the
close
of
1969
equaling
100
.

The
percentage
change
is
since
year-end
.

The
nation
's
biggest
beverage
companies
are
expected
to
report
stronger
third-quarter
earnings
,
even
as
the
soft-drink
giants
take
their
lumps
from
higher
domestic
soda
prices
and
brewers
'
struggle
with
flat
industry
volume
.

Coca-Cola
Co.
,
the
first
of
the
group
to
report
,
said
yesterday
that
earnings
rose
10
%
,
excluding
a
gain
from
the
sale
of
a
bottled
water
business
.

PepsiCo
Inc.
and
Anheuser-Busch
Cos.
will
report
third-quarter
earnings
gains
of
at
least
9
%
and
14
%
,
respectively
,
while
results
for
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
Inc.
and
Adolph
Coors
Co.
will
decline
,
analysts
estimate
.

Since
the
summer
,
soft-drink
companies
have
been
trying
to
extract
themselves
from
a
price-slashing
war
designed
to
steal
market
share
from
each
other
.

The
battle
drove
up
volumes
for
several
years
,
but
the
discounted
prices
have
squeezed
bottlers
'
profit
margins
.

Because
raw
material
costs
have
been
escalating
and
because
Coke
and
Pepsi
have
become
bigger
owners
of
bottling
businesses
,
the
companies
have
been
raising
soda
pop
prices
in
recent
months
.

That
,
along
with
generally
cooler
,
rainier
weather
this
year
,
has
slowed
the
industry
's
volume
growth
.

Unlike
the
4
%
to
5
%
growth
rate
of
recent
years
,
the
soft-drink
industry
is
expected
to
report
third-quarter
volume
was
,
at
worst
,
flat
,
and
at
best
,
up
only
3
%
.

That
's
a
fairly
wide
range
,
given
the
sheer
size
of
the
$
42
billion
soft-drink
industry
.

But
analysts
,
and
indeed
,
some
of
the
soda
companies
,
have
had
difficulty
predicting
consumer
reaction
to
higher
prices
.

In
August
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
,
Coke
's
largest
bottling
operation
,
said
its
1989
earnings
would
fall
as
much
as
37
%
,
partly
because
it
misjudged
consumer
resistance
to
the
new
prices
,
which
were
2
%
to
3
%
higher
on
average
in
July
and
August
.

Blaming
higher
prices
in
part
,
Coca-Cola
said
its
third-quarter
unit
case
sales
were
flat
.

The
volume
in
the
summer
selling
season
suffered
,
too
,
from
the
lack
of
a
critical
,
yet
intangible
,
element
in
the
softdrink
industry
:
excitement
.

After
a
controversial
flap
involving
a
Madonna
music
video
,
Pepsi
dropped
its
plans
for
a
big
summer
advertising
promotion
featuring
the
pop
singer
.

And
there
have
been
no
major
new
product
introductions
,
such
as
cherry-flavored
soft
drinks
,
which
made
sales
sizzle
two
years
ago
.

``
What
's
been
hot
in
the
soft-drink
business
lately
?
''
asks
Emanuel
Goldman
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

``
Nothing
.

''
Still
,
the
beverage
industry
's
slower
results
in
the
latest
quarter
could
lead
to
some
positive
earnings
surprises
in
next
year
's
third
quarter
,
when
comparisons
will
be
easier
,
said
George
Thompson
,
an
analyst
with
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

``
This
year
's
ugly
ducklings
will
be
next
year
's
swans
,
''
he
said
.

Coca-Cola
's
earnings
were
stronger
primarily
because
of
sharply
improved
volume
from
the
company
's
international
operations
,
which
account
for
the
bulk
of
its
business
.

Volume
rose
14
%
,
well
ahead
of
analysts
'
10
%
to
11
%
projections
for
the
business
.

Analysts
are
looking
for
Pepsi
to
earn
as
much
as
$
1.04
a
share
,
with
most
estimates
settling
around
99
cents
,
compared
with
91
cents
in
the
year-ago
quarter
.

The
latest
quarter
results
,
are
expected
to
be
a
little
soft
compared
with
Pepsi
's
historical
earnings
growth
rate
,
reflecting
some
dilution
for
snack-food
and
soft-drink
bottling
acquisitions
.

Stronger
restaurant
and
snack-food
sales
helped
boost
Pepsi
's
profits
,
too
,
analysts
said
.

Anheuser-Busch
is
expected
to
report
third-quarter
earnings
between
89
cents
and
92
cents
a
share
,
compared
with
78
cents
a
year
earlier
.

On
the
strength
of
Bud
Light
,
Busch
and
Michelob
Dry
,
the
company
's
volume
in
the
quarter
is
estimated
to
increase
about
3
%
to
4
%
,
while
the
rest
of
the
industry
will
be
flat
,
or
up
slightly
.

Coors
earnings
are
expected
to
fall
,
as
its
volume
declines
perhaps
3
%
to
4
%
.

Coors
is
expected
to
achieve
greater
production
efficiencies
once
it
completes
its
plan
,
announced
last
month
,
to
acquire
most
of
the
beer-related
assets
of
Stroh
Brewery
Co
.

``
Time
,
''
says
Tamara
Geva
,
``
is
meaningless
.

My
youth
in
Petrograd
,
my
father
--
whom
I
never
saw
again
after
1924
,
when
I
left
Russia
for
the
West
--
the
whole
of
my
early
life
,
it
's
all
been
brought
back
to
me
by
the
arrival
,
out
of
a
clear
blue
sky
,
of
this
exhibition
.

The
years
between
Petrograd
and
New
York
are
the
dream
.

The
objects
I
grew
up
with
,
the
things
I
thought
I
had
said
goodbye
to
forever
--
that
is
the
reality
.

''
The
reality
to
which
Ms.
Geva
refers
is
the
hoard
of
dance
memorabilia
currently
on
view
at
Eduard
Nakhamkin
Fine
Arts
here
,
under
the
title
,
``
100
Years
of
Russian
Ballet
:
1830-1930
.

''
Consisting
of
roughly
400
items
from
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
,
the
show
offers
tantalizing
glimpses
of
a
rich
artistic
achievement
.

For
Ms.
Geva
,
an
actress
and
author
who
began
her
career
as
a
dancer
during
the
early
days
of
the
Soviet
state
under
her
original
name
of
Gevergeyeva
,
it
offers
something
more
:
a
sense
of
completion
,
the
lifting
of
a
curtain
on
the
past
.

A
great
deal
of
what
is
currently
on
display
in
New
York
belonged
to
her
father
.

These
lithographs
,
designs
,
programs
,
photographs
,
which
she
pored
over
day
after
day
,
fed
her
adolescent
yearning
to
join
the
ballet
.

Of
this
ambition
her
father
disapproved
,
because
,
he
said
,
dancers
were
n't
properly
educated
.

Levki
Gevergeyev
had
a
passion
for
learning
and
for
the
arts
,
especially
the
performing
arts
.

In
addition
to
his
holdings
of
theatrical
material
,
he
also
owned
50,000
books
,
among
them
a
great
cache
of
bibles
,
although
,
in
fact
,
he
was
an
atheist
.

That
did
n't
keep
him
from
making
a
great
deal
of
money
manufacturing
gold
vestments
for
the
Russian
Orthodox
Church
.

He
owned
a
26-room
house
,
in
which
,
according
to
his
daughter
,
four
enormous
rooms
were
filled
with
his
collection
.

After
the
Revolution
,
when
everything
he
owned
was
sequestered
by
the
Bolsheviks
,
he
was
put
in
charge
of
the
state
's
first
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
,
situated
in
Ostrovsky
Square
.

In
effect
,
he
became
the
official
curator
of
his
former
collection
,
which
grew
prodigiously
and
soon
included
several
thousand
costumes
.

Despite
the
deprivations
to
which
her
father
was
subject
in
those
years
,
Ms.
Geva
imagines
that
he
must
have
been
happy
to
be
allowed
to
remain
with
the
objects
he
had
assembled
so
devotedly
.

While
she
found
out
soon
after
the
war
that
he
had
perished
during
the
Siege
of
Leningrad
,
she
did
n't
know
until
the
curators
arrived
from
the
Soviet
Union
with
the
contents
of
this
exhibition
that
he
had
died
of
starvation
on
a
sofa
in
the
museum
.

Though
weakened
by
malnutrition
,
he
was
unwilling
to
budge
in
case
the
collection
was
bombed
and
needed
to
be
saved
.

As
it
happened
,
the
collection
survived
intact
.

Today
,
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
owns
some
400,000
items
.

For
Americans
,
the
most
interesting
of
the
400
items
on
display
in
New
York
include
designs
by
the
German-born
Andrei
Roller
(
1805-91
)
for
the
Russian
productions
of
important
early
19th-century
Paris
ballets
.

No
less
illuminating
are
the
designs
from
Petipa
's
``
Sleeping
Beauty
''
(
1890
)
,
``
Nutcracker
''
(
1892
)
and
``
Raymonda
''
(
1897
)
,
which
shed
light
on
the
role
played
by
spectacle
in
the
ballets
of
this
great
choreographer
.

There
also
is
much
to
be
learned
from
the
early
stage
photographs
of
Petipa
's
work
,
which
,
though
posed
,
extend
our
knowledge
of
its
theatrical
ambiance
.

Petipa
,
the
fountainhead
of
balletic
classicism
,
emerges
as
the
show
's
hero
,
whether
perceived
through
scenes
from
his
ballets
or
through
glimpses
of
the
dancers
whose
technique
and
artistry
his
choreography
played
a
decisive
role
in
shaping
.

Among
the
most
important
of
the
Petipa
ballerinas
is
Mathilde
Kchessinska
,
represented
in
a
series
of
fascinating
photographs
.

The
mistress
of
Nicholas
II
until
his
engagement
to
Alexandra
of
Hesse-Darmstadt
,
she
dominated
the
Imperial
Ballet
of
St.
Petersburg
as
much
through
her
dancing
as
through
her
connections
.

Even
Isadora
Duncan
,
the
self-professed
enemy
of
ballet
,
found
her
enchanting
.

A
1910
photograph
shows
Kchessinska
reclining
on
a
chaise
longue
in
her
St.
Petersburg
mansion
.

Clearly
visible
in
the
background
is
the
balcony
from
which
Lenin
was
to
proclaim
the
Revolution
.

The
Diaghilev
material
is
less
interesting
.

The
Ballets
Russes
never
appeared
in
Russia
and
most
of
the
important
artifacts
are
in
the
West
.

George
Balanchine
,
to
whom
Ms.
Geva
was
married
as
a
teenager
in
1923
and
who
began
his
career
as
an
artistic
revolutionary
,
also
gets
short
shrift
.

Better
by
far
is
the
representation
accorded
the
avant-garde
dance
that
flourished
in
the
U.S.S.R.
until
ruthlessly
repressed
during
the
Stalin
years
.

The
presence
of
so
much
material
concerning
Feodor
Lopukhov
,
the
leading
choreographer
of
the
post-Revolutionary
Leningrad
school
,
and
virtually
unknown
in
this
country
,
is
particularly
welcome
.

Less
welcome
is
the
random
nature
of
the
exhibition
,
which
has
no
point
to
make
beyond
the
indisputable
fact
that
there
are
treasures
in
the
Leningrad
State
Museum
of
Theater
and
Music
.

Miscellaneous
and
haphazard
--
did
we
really
need
to
see
Anna
Pavlova
's
tea
set
or
Marie
Petipa
's
slipper
?
--
the
show
invites
uninformed
,
and
thus
superficial
,
viewing
.

While
it
's
an
astonishing
achievement
for
the
Nakhamkin
gallery
to
have
organized
the
show
in
only
three
months
,
the
time
has
surely
come
to
present
this
kind
of
material
in
ways
that
reveal
a
context
and
a
point
of
view
.

Even
the
title
is
misleading
:
The
exhibition
covers
ballet
,
not
in
Russia
,
but
only
in
what
is
now
Leningrad
.

It
also
begins
before
1830
and
ends
after
1930
.

In
compiling
the
catalog
,
the
gallery
has
missed
a
great
opportunity
to
document
a
lot
of
rare
material
.

Though
well-illustrated
,
the
publication
is
uninformative
and
often
simply
untrustworthy
.

Clearly
,
no
dance
lover
should
skip
the
show
,
but
it
's
only
a
stopgap
for
the
serious
,
scholarly
endeavor
we
really
need
.

The
show
closes
in
New
York
on
Oct.
20
and
reopens
in
Saratoga
,
N.Y.
,
on
May
19
at
the
National
Museum
of
Dance
,
its
co-sponsor
.

``
In
our
business
,
''
says
Groupe
Bull
Chairman
Francis
Lorentz
,
``
one
and
one
sometimes
add
up
to
1.1
,
or
1.2
,
but
rarely
two
.

''
Mr.
Lorentz
is
talking
about
mergers
,
not
mathematics
.

Bull
,
the
French-government-owned
computer
maker
,
earlier
this
month
agreed
to
buy
the
computer
business
of
Zenith
Electronics
Corp.
for
as
much
as
$
635
million
,
but
denies
this
is
a
merger
.

Bull
says
it
intends
to
retain
existing
management
of
the
U.S.
unit
and
keep
the
Zenith
label
,
while
selling
Zenith
personal
computers
--
a
product
line
in
which
Bull
had
been
lagging
--
as
part
of
Bull
data-processing
systems
.

Merger
or
not
,
the
Zenith
acquisition
is
a
key
part
of
Mr.
Lorentz
's
plan
to
grow
Bull
--
the
world
's
11th
biggest
computer
company
last
year
--
into
a
profitable
member
of
the
top
five
or
six
computer
makers
.

It
wo
n't
be
easy
.

Bull
had
a
first-half
net
loss
of
537
million
francs
(
$
82.7
million
)
on
revenue
of
14
billion
francs
(
$
2.16
billion
)
.

Mr.
Lorentz
says
his
objective
remains
posting
a
small
profit
for
this
year
,
but
he
is
n't
certain
the
company
will
make
it
into
the
black
.

He
adds
that
any
full-year
loss
wo
n't
be
``
anywhere
as
big
''
as
the
first-half
loss
,
which
was
caused
in
part
by
production
problems
,
``
which
are
being
solved
,
''
at
the
company
's
Angers
,
France
,
circuit-board
plant
and
a
squeeze
on
profit
margins
because
of
growing
competition
.

In
any
event
,
Bull
thus
far
has
n't
had
any
trouble
finding
the
cash
to
fund
its
acquisitions
.

Bull
posted
a
profit
in
1988
of
303
million
francs
on
revenue
of
31.55
billion
francs
.

The
other
key
to
Bull
's
future
health
is
its
other
U.S.
leg
.

Bull
last
year
increased
to
69.4
%
its
controlling
interest
in
Honeywell
Bull
Inc
.

Honeywell
Inc.
retains
15.6
%
,
and
NEC
Corp.
of
Japan
owns
the
remaining
15
%
.

In
addition
,
Bull
renamed
the
U.S.
company
Bull
HN
Information
Services
Inc
.

Bull
HN
reports
to
Mr.
Lorentz
as
chairman
of
holding
company
Cie.
des
Machines
Bull
.

During
the
past
decade
or
so
,
Bull
and
Honeywell
tried
various
approaches
to
combining
their
businesses
,
none
of
which
really
jelled
.

``
We
were
spending
all
our
energies
internally
,
while
externally
the
world
was
changing
at
breakneck
speed
,
''
Mr.
Lorentz
says
.

But
now
,
with
Bull
in
firm
control
,
these
U.S.
operations
are
key
ingredients
in
Mr.
Lorentz
's
plans
to
ensure
that
Bull
remains
one
of
the
half-dozen
or
so
world-wide
,
full-range
computer
companies
likely
to
survive
the
1990s
.

To
do
so
,
Bull
is
planting
itself
firmly
in
the
U.S.
,
where
,
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
a
lot
of
the
best
people
and
research
are
.

The
Zenith
buy
means
Bull
will
derive
22
%
of
its
revenue
from
the
U.S.
--
up
from
18
%
previously
--
and
the
company
spends
30
%
of
its
3.64
billion-franc
research
and
development
budget
in
the
U.S
.

Keeping
Zenith
relatively
independant
,
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
makes
sense
because
``
they
are
completely
different
cultures
,
making
personal
computers
,
like
Zenith
,
and
making
mainframes
like
Bull
.

''
He
says
disarmingly
:
``
We
are
n't
fast
enough
.

We
{
mainframe
makers
}
live
in
cycles
of
four
or
five
years
of
development
and
product
life
.

They
{
PC
makers
}
get
six
months
of
development
and
maybe
12
months
of
shelf
life
.

They
can
afford
to
take
some
risks
and
fail
.

''
``
It
is
absolutely
essential
to
keep
Zenith
's
originality
,
its
extraordinary
force
,
''
the
47-year-old
Mr.
Lorentz
adds
.

``
Our
vocation
is
to
be
able
to
respond
to
any
question
our
clients
ask
,
''
says
Mr.
Lorentz
,
who
joined
Bull
seven
years
ago
after
stints
as
chief
financial
officer
of
a
water
company
and
various
posts
in
the
French
Treasury
.

``
We
want
to
be
able
to
offer
complete
systems
in
specialized
areas
,
like
banking
,
ranging
from
the
automated-teller
machines
to
the
front-desk
workstation
to
the
back-office
equipment
to
the
mainframe
computer
.

To
do
these
we
need
to
make
all
the
basic
building
blocks
.

''
Mr.
Lorentz
succeeded
Jacques
Stern
as
chairman
of
Bull
in
June
,
and
like
his
predecessor
,
he
is
a
crusader
for
``
open
software
''
--
that
is
standards
that
will
work
on
the
machines
of
various
makers
--
in
order
to
give
smaller
companies
like
Bull
a
chance
against
industry
giants
.

Mr.
Lorentz
,
Mr.
Stern
's
No.
2
since
1982
,
inherits
the
task
of
making
Bull
the
biggest
and
healthiest
European
soup-to-nuts
computer
company
,
competing
globally
with
the
likes
of
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
,
Unisys
Corp.
,
and
a
handful
of
Japanese
companies
.

Counting
only
sales
of
computer
equipment
,
Bull
is
already
the
biggest
in
Europe
,
ahead
of
Siemens
AG
of
West
Germany
and
Ing
.

C.
Olivetti
&
Co.
of
Italy
,
Mr.
Lorentz
says
.

Mr.
Lorentz
,
an
intense
,
cerebral
product
of
France
's
elite
``
Ecole
National
d'Administration
''
likes
to
go
rock
climbing
in
his
spare
time
,
and
used
to
practice
the
martial
art
of
aikido
.

He
will
discuss
frankly
Bull
's
past
problems
;
when
asked
if
the
company
has
suffered
from
an
unfocussed
image
,
he
readily
agrees
.

He
allows
that
the
products
of
all
computer
makers
are
getting
more
and
more
alike
--
``
a
certain
banalization
''
he
calls
it
--
and
that
specialized
service
will
make
the
difference
in
the
future
.

``
How
we
manage
the
problem
of
service
will
make
all
the
difference
between
now
and
1995
,
''
he
says
.

After
having
added
Zenith
PCs
to
the
Bull
stable
,
Mr.
Lorentz
says
,
the
company
will
be
better
armed
for
battle
especially
in
Europe
.

``
Our
biggest
asset
is
that
we
are
well
implanted
in
Europe
,
and
Europe
will
be
the
fastest
growing
market
in
the
world
over
the
next
10
years
.

''
But
the
conquest
of
Europe
will
happen
,
in
part
,
from
the
U.S
.

``
The
information
industry
is
global
,
''
says
Mr.
Lorenz
,
``
but
the
image
of
that
industry
is
created
in
the
U.S.
,
so
we
must
be
present
in
the
U.S.
in
order
to
be
known
everywhere
else
.

The
U.S.
represents
45
%
of
the
world
information
market
,
so
it
's
45
%
of
our
world
.

The
technology
and
the
human
resources
are
there
,
and
since
the
scarcest
resource
for
us
is
people
,
and
the
people
are
in
the
U.S.
,
so
are
we
.

That
's
the
whole
story
.

''
With
stock
prices
hovering
near
record
levels
,
a
number
of
companies
have
been
announcing
stock
splits
.

But
investors
trying
to
play
all
the
angles
may
find
that
stock
splits
are
a
lot
like
cotton
candy
:
They
look
tempting
,
but
there
's
hardly
any
substance
.

And
they
can
even
leave
a
sticky
problem
,
in
the
form
of
higher
brokerage
commissions
.

``
A
stock
split
unaccompanied
by
a
cash
dividend
increase
is
like
giving
somebody
five
singles
for
a
$
5
bill
.

You
've
got
a
thicker
billfold
,
but
it
has
no
economic
significance
whatsoever
,
''
says
Leon
Cooperman
,
a
partner
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

In
a
typical
split
,
a
company
increases
the
number
of
shares
it
has
outstanding
,
with
each
stockholder
participating
on
the
basis
of
existing
holdings
.

With
a
2-for-1
split
,
for
example
,
an
investor
who
owned
100
shares
before
the
split
would
have
200
shares
afterward
.

The
stock
's
price
usually
falls
to
reflect
the
greater
number
of
shares
,
assuming
no
other
changes
at
the
company
.

Companies
usually
split
their
shares
in
the
hope
that
a
lower
share
price
will
attract
more
individual
investors
,
increase
trading
volume
and
improve
the
stock
's
liquidity
.

The
theory
is
that
a
stock
selling
for
$
20
or
$
30
a
share
will
be
more
affordable
to
individuals
than
one
selling
for
more
than
$
100
--
especially
for
investors
who
like
to
buy
round
lots
of
100
shares
.

Take
L.A.
Gear
Inc.
,
a
fast-growing
designer
and
marketer
of
athletic
footwear
that
had
a
2-for-1
split
last
month
.

The
main
reason
for
the
split
was
``
to
make
the
stock
more
attractive
to
the
retail
buyer
,
''
says
Elliott
J.
Horowitz
,
the
company
's
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
.

But
if
a
stock
suddenly
becomes
more
attractive
to
the
masses
,
should
n't
that
boost
its
price
?
After
all
,
L.A.
Gear
was
selling
for
around
$
60
a
share
when
the
split
was
announced
on
Aug.
24
,
then
soared
to
more
than
$
75
a
share
before
splitting
in
late
September
.

Yesterday
,
the
stock
closed
at
$
41.75
.

Mr.
Horowitz
scoffs
at
the
idea
that
his
company
's
price
surge
was
caused
by
the
split
.

``
If
it
were
that
easy
to
take
a
stock
from
60
to
75
,
I
think
a
lot
of
other
companies
would
be
doing
it
,
''
he
says
.

While
a
split
``
does
create
more
demand
for
the
stock
,
''
he
says
,
``
I
just
do
n't
think
it
's
that
much
of
a
factor
.

''
Investment
managers
and
others
agree
.

While
a
stock
split
accompanied
by
a
dividend
increase
can
pack
a
powerful
punch
,
a
split
by
itself
``
has
no
lasting
impact
on
the
stock
price
,
''
says
Mr.
Cooperman
of
Goldman
Sachs
.

Adds
James
L.
Cochrane
,
senior
vice
president
at
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
:
``
We
've
done
research
on
this
,
and
it
shows
a
split
really
does
n't
to
seem
to
matter
significantly
.

''
Even
if
splits
did
affect
stock
prices
,
some
academics
argue
that
it
would
be
futile
for
investors
to
try
to
take
advantage
of
them
.

In
their
view
,
financial
markets
tend
to
anticipate
news
.

Thus
any
impact
from
a
split
would
already
be
incorporated
in
a
stock
's
price
by
the
time
the
split
was
announced
,
they
argue
.

``
Normally
,
the
investor
is
n't
able
to
benefit
''
by
buying
a
company
's
stock
immediately
after
news
of
a
split
,
says
Frank
K.
Reilly
,
a
Notre
Dame
professor
of
finance
and
co-author
of
a
1981
study
on
splits
.

``
By
the
time
the
average
investor
hears
the
news
,
traders
already
have
acted
and
the
stock
already
has
moved
.

''
A
few
money
managers
even
say
a
stock
split
sometimes
may
represent
a
sell
signal
.

``
Remember
the
old
Wall
Street
adage
:
Buy
on
the
rumor
and
sell
on
the
news
,
''
says
Samuel
Thorne
Jr.
,
a
managing
director
at
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
in
Boston
.

Splits
can
also
mean
a
bigger
expense
for
investors
when
they
buy
or
sell
shares
.

That
's
because
brokerage
houses
often
calculate
their
commission
rates
using
a
complex
formula
based
partly
on
the
number
of
shares
being
traded
.

For
example
,
a
Merrill
Lynch
official
says
that
firm
's
commission
on
100
shares
of
a
$
40
stock
would
be
about
$
97
.

But
the
commission
would
jump
to
about
$
115
to
trade
200
shares
of
a
$
20
stock
--
even
though
the
dollar
amount
of
the
trade
would
be
exactly
the
same
.

Another
large
firm
gave
similar
figures
:
The
standard
commission
on
100
shares
of
a
$
40
stock
would
be
$
91
,
but
the
commission
would
jump
to
$
112.50
to
trade
200
shares
of
a
$
20
stock
.

``
Stock
splits
are
the
biggest
ripoff
on
Wall
Street
,
''
contends
Hans
R.
Reinisch
,
a
New
York
investor
.

``
The
only
thing
that
changes
with
a
split
is
the
brokerage
commissions
,
and
they
often
go
up
sharply
.

If
you
're
an
active
investor
,
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
transaction
costs
.

''
Some
corporate
executives
also
question
the
idea
that
more
shares
are
better
.

Among
these
is
Warren
E.
Buffett
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Berkshire
Hathaway
Inc.
,
whose
stock
closed
yesterday
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
at
$
8,700
a
share
.

``
We
often
are
asked
why
Berkshire
does
not
split
its
stock
,
''
he
wrote
in
the
company
's
1983
annual
report
.

``
The
assumption
behind
this
question
usually
appears
to
be
that
a
split
would
be
a
pro-shareholder
action
.

We
disagree
.

''
In
the
lengthy
discussion
that
followed
,
Mr.
Buffett
said
:
``
We
want
{
shareholders
}
who
think
of
themselves
as
business
owners
with
the
intention
of
staying
a
long
time
.

And
,
we
want
those
who
keep
their
eyes
focused
on
business
results
,
not
market
prices
.

''
Underscoring
his
feelings
on
the
subject
,
Mr.
Buffett
once
sent
a
birthday
greeting
to
a
friend
,
wishing
him
good
health
and
saying
:
``
May
you
live
until
Berkshire
splits
.

''
Still
,
many
companies
like
splits
as
an
inexpensive
marketing
tool
that
generates
favorable
publicity
and
helps
broaden
their
shareholder
base
.

A
stock
split
is
``
a
nice
exercise
in
cosmetics
,
but
that
's
about
all
,
''
says
James
H.
Coxon
,
senior
vice
president
and
head
of
the
common-stock
division
at
Cigna
Investments
Inc
.

``
It
's
a
small
net
positive
because
it
can
improve
the
marketability
of
a
particular
stock
.

But
it
's
really
of
very
little
significance
.

''
A
split
's
impact
,
if
any
,
can
depend
on
the
company
involved
and
the
price
of
that
company
's
stock
,
says
John
P.
Rosenthal
,
senior
partner
of
Silberberg
,
Rosenthal
&
Co
.

But
he
adds
that
any
impact
from
a
split
``
really
is
very
short-term
.

''
Advises
Michael
Metz
,
a
managing
director
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co
:
``
Just
ignore
splits
.

''
In
his
view
,
``
They
're
irrelevant
for
the
long-term
investor
.

Look
only
at
the
fundamentals
of
a
company
,
not
whether
it
splits
its
stock
.

FEDERAL
INDUSTRIES
Ltd.
said
it
agreed
with
underwiters
led
by

Inc.

issue
75
million
Canadian
dollars

Federal

Your
Sept.

story
on
the
destroyer
DDG-51
,
the
Arleigh
Burke
,
inaccurately
asserts
,
``
several
aluminum-hulled
British
ships
were
destroyed
by
Argentine
missiles
.

''
Only
one
aluminum-hulled
British
vessel
was
so
destroyed
,
the
HMS
Sheffield
.

It
was
struck
by
an
Exocet
,
setting
off
fires
that
ignited
its
aluminum
superstructure
.

As
far
as
I
know
,
there
is
no
way
to
extinguish
such
a
fire
at
sea
,
which
is
why
the
U.S.
Navy
has
sensibly
built
the
Burke
of
steel
.

However
,
the
Navy
also
claims
that
its
mostly
aluminum
Aegis-class
cruisers
,
some
of
which
are
yet
to
be
built
,
could
never
meet
the
fate
of
the
Sheffield
because
no
enemy
missile
could
penetrate
their
defenses
.

``
Snoozing
''
through
the
Beijing
massacre
?
This
is
the
buzzword
Adi
Ignatius
chooses
to
characterize
in
his
review
of
my
book
``
Tiananmen
Diary
:
Thirteen
Days
in
June
''
(
Leisire
&
Arts
,
Sept.
8
)
.

I
doubt
that
many
readers
of
this
chronicle
of
the
blood
and
bullets
and
terror
of
the
Beijing
massacre
would
put
it
just
this
way
.

Nor
mistake
,
as
he
seems
to
have
done
,
a
raw
,
rough-cut
,
unretouched
,
genuine
diary
,
complete
with
blips
,
print
lice
and
all
the
confusions
of
real
time
with
high-gloss
footnoted
academic
scholarship
.

Such
works
will
be
forthcoming
,
but
I
doubt
if
they
will
convey
the
anguish
of
what
Mr.
Ignatius
calls
my
``
insta-book

Securities
analysts
are
using
terms
like
``
kitchen-sink
syndrome
''
and
``
clearing
the
decks
''
to
describe
the
generally
disappointing
results
that
commercial
banks
are
expected
to
report
in
the
coming
weeks
.

A
number
of
major
banks
have
chosen
to
make
huge
additions
to
their
loan-loss
reserves
in
the
third
quarter
,
either
for
troubled
loans
to
Latin
American
nations
,
soured
real-estate
loans
in
this
country
or
bad
loans
to
companies
involved
in
leveraged
buy-outs
.

The
banks
hope
to
get
the
bad
news
behind
them
now
,
so
that
their
earnings
--
and
their
stock
prices
--
can
rebound
in
the
coming
quarters
.

J.P.
Morgan
&
Co.
has
effectively
neutralized
any
problems
that
its
developing-country
loan
portfolio
could
pose
in
the
future
by
announcing
a
$
2
billion
addition
to
reserves
for
the
quarter
.

As
a
result
,
Morgan
will
post
a
loss
for
the
quarter
and
year
.

Similarly
,
Manufacturers
Hanover
Corp.
made
a
big
addition
to
reserves
for
developing-country
debt
that
will
cause
it
to
post
a
loss
.

Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
on
Wednesday
,
as
expected
,
reported
a
net
loss
for
the
third
quarter
of
$
1.11
billion
,
or
$
12.45
a
share
,
following
a
massive
addition
to
reserves
for
possible
losses
on
loans
primarily
to
developing
countries
.

And
several
regional
banks
,
including
Bank
of
Boston
Corp.
and
First
Bank
System
Inc.
,
are
expected
to
report
losses
stemming
from
major
additions
to
reserves
for
foundering
domestic
loans
.

With
all
this
disappointing
news
,
analysts
would
n't
be
surprised
to
see
other
banks
,
particularly
those
with
loans
to
developing
countries
,
use
the
spate
of
reserve-building
by
others
as
an
opportunity
to
clean
up
their
own
balance
sheets
.

The
nation
's
biggest
banking
company
,
Citicorp
,
is
n't
expected
to
follow
the
lead
of
Manufacturers
,
Chase
and
Morgan
with
a
massive
boost
in
reserves
.

Nevertheless
,
analysts
expect
Citicorp
's
third
quarter
will
be
near
its
level
for
the
same
period
a
year
ago
and
therefore
somewhat
disappointing
.

Many
analysts
were
expecting
generally
weak
third-quarter
results
anyway
due
to
continued
rises
in
non-performing
loans
and
pressure
on
interest-rate
margins
.

Keefe
,
Bruyette
&
Woods
Inc.
,
a
securities
firm
specializing
in
bank
stocks
,
estimates
that
third-quarter
results
will
rise
8
%
from
the
year-ago
figure
for
144
regional
banks
that
it
follows
.

That
's
the
smallest
increase
this
year
.

The
principal
reason
for
the
slower
growth
is
the
narrowing
difference
in
interest
rates
on
loans
and
the
cost
of
interest-bearing
consumer
deposits
.

Keefe
estimates
this
difference
will
shrink
to
4.39
percentage
points
in
the
third
quarter
,
the
lowest
level
in
a
year
.

Further
deterioration
in
domestic
loan
quality
is
adding
to
the
pressure
on
earnings
.

Nonperforming
real-estate
loans
in
New
England
continue
to
climb
,
and
the
number
of
highly
leveraged
commercial
loans
that
have
gotten
into
trouble
is
rising
.

International
,
Seaman
Furniture
Co.
,
Lomas
Financial
Group
Inc.
,
Integrated
Resources
Inc.
and

Inc.
are
some
of
the
more
prominent
troubled
concerns
