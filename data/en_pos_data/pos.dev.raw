The
Arizona
Corporations
Commission
authorized
an
11.5
%
rate
increase
at
Tucson
Electric
Power
Co.
,
substantially
lower
than
recommended
last
month
by
a
commission
hearing
officer
and
barely
half
the
rise
sought
by
the
utility
.

The
ruling
follows
a
host
of
problems
at
Tucson
Electric
,
including
major
write-downs
,
a
60
%
slash
in
the
common
stock
dividend
and
the
departure
of
former
Chairman
Einar
Greve
during
a
company
investigation
of
his
stock
sales
.

The
Arizona
regulatory
ruling
calls
for
$
42
million
in
added
revenue
yearly
,
compared
with
a
$
57
million
boost
proposed
by
the
commission
hearing
officer
.

The
company
had
sought
increases
totaling
$
80.3
million
,
or
22
%
.

The
decision
was
announced
after
trading
ended
.

Tucson
Electric
closed
at
$
20.875
a
share
,
down
25
cents
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
.

A
Tucson
Electric
spokesman
said
the
utility
was
disappointed
by
the
commission
's
decision
and
``
concerned
about
the
financial
integrity
of
the
company
.

''
South
Korean
President
Roh
Tae
Woo
,
brushing
aside
suggestions
that
the
won
be
revalued
again
,
said
the
currency
's
current
level
against
the
dollar
is
``
appropriate
.

''
His
comments
,
made
in
response
to
reporters
'
questions
at
the
National
Press
Club
here
,
signaled
that
Seoul
is
resisting
U.S.
pressure
for
a
further
rise
in
the
currency
's
value
.

The
U.S.
wants
a
higher
won
to
make
South
Korea
's
exports
more
expensive
and
help
trim
Seoul
's
trade
surplus
.

Many
South
Korean
business
people
want
a
devaluation
instead
,
arguing
that
the
won
's
recent
gains
already
have
weakened
the
country
's
export
performance
.

Mr.
Roh
also
said
South
Korea
is
taking
steps
that
would
free
the
won
to
respond
to
market
forces
.

Seoul
has
pointed
to
its
lack
of
a
foreign
exchange
market
as
one
reason
the
won
's
value
remains
heavily
controlled
.

Mr.
Roh
said
a
U.S.
demand
for
the
removal
of
South
Korean
import
quotas
on
beef
will
be
resolved
``
satisfactorily
''
but
gave
no
hint
when
that
will
happen
.

Speaking
to
a
joint
meeting
of
Congress
earlier
,
he
said
South
Korea
ca
n't
move
quickly
on
such
agricultural
trade
issues
``
without
causing
political
and
social
trauma
.

''
Great
American
Bank
said
its
board
approved
the
formation
of
a
holding
company
enabling
the
savings
bank
to
pursue
nontraditional
banking
activities
under
a
new
federal
law
.

The
proposed
holding
company
's
primary
purpose
would
be
to
allow
Great
American
to
continue
engaging
in
real
estate
development
activities
,
it
said
.

Those
activities
generated
$
26.1
million
in
operating
profit
last
year
.

But
according
to
Great
American
,
such
profits
do
n't
count
toward
meeting
the
San
Diego
savings
bank
's
new
capitalization
requirements
under
1989
federal
law
.

The
new
real
estate
unit
would
have
a
separate
capital
structure
to
comply
with
the
law
.

The
proposed
holding
company
would
also
consolidate
Great
American
Bank
in
San
Diego
and
its
Tucson
,
Ariz.
,
savings
bank
into
a
single
,
federally
chartered
institution
in
San
Diego
.

The
consolidation
is
expected
to
save
$
1
million
a
year
in
administrative
costs
,
a
Great
American
spokesman
said
.

Dale
Lang
,
who
this
week
completed
the
acquisition
of
the
publisher
of
Ms.
and
Sassy
,
is
candid
about
the
challenge
he
is
taking
on
.

Mr.
Lang
admits
that
Ms.
is
``
in
dire
straits
''
and
that
Sassy
needs
big
promotional
dollars
to
keep
it
alive
.

But
the
57-year-old
publisher
has
moved
quickly
and
boldly
to
deal
with
the
magazines
'
problems
.

Last
Friday
,
he
told
the
staff
of
Ms.
that
the
magazine
in
January
would
begin
publishing
without
advertising
.

Mr.
Lang
will
do
away
with
expensive
circulation
drives
,
not
to
mention
sales
staff
,
and
attempt
to
publish
the
17-year-old
magazine
supported
by
circulation
revenue
alone
.

``
Any
fool
can
publish
a
money-losing
magazine
.

I
want
to
publish
one
that
succeeds
,
''
said
Mr.
Lang
.

``
For
Ms.
,
it
's
time
to
publish
for
the
reader
,
not
the
advertiser
.

''
As
for
Sassy
,
which
competes
directly
with
News
Corp.
's
Seventeen
magazine
,
Mr.
Lang
says
that
in
the
next
two
years
he
will
spend
$
6
million
promoting
and
improving
the
magazine
.

Though
Sassy
has
grown
quickly
since
its
debut
in
March
1988
,
it
has
been
the
target
of
conservative
lobbyists
and
skittish
advertisers
who
bristled
at
its
frank
editorial
matter
on
teen-age
problems
.

Mr.
Lang
said
the
former
Australian
owners
of
Sassy
were
``
blind-sided
by
the
Moral
Majority
...
.

Their
reaction
was
to
do
nothing
and
ride
it
out
.

''
He
said
Sassy
will
keep
its
irreverent
tone
,
but
added
,
``
We
will
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
editorial
content
of
the
magazine
.

''
Sassy
already
has
recovered
;
circulation
has
quickly
passed
the
500,000
mark
and
advertising
pages
have
stabilized
this
year
at
more
than
300
.

What
's
more
,
Mr.
Lang
says
he
has
what
all
publishers
wish
for
:
a
bona
fide
niche
.

``
Seventeen
is
written
more
for
mothers
,
not
their
daughters
,
''
said
Mr.
Lang
.

``
But
Sassy
has
a
different
spirit
.

It
gets
more
mail
in
a
month
than
McCall
's
got
in
a
year
,
and
it
's
not
from
mothers
.

I
feel
about
Sassy
like
I
did
about
Working
Woman
10
years
ago
.

''
Mr.
Lang
took
on
Ms.
and
Sassy
with
the
acquisition
of
Matilda
Publications
Inc.
by
his
newly
formed
Lang
Communications
.

Lang
owns
70
%
of
Matilda
,
while
Citicorp
owns
the
rest
through
its
Citicorp
Venture
Capital
Partners
.

Two
weeks
ago
,
Citicorp
and
Mr.
Lang
pumped
$
800,000
into
Matilda
just
to
keep
the
doors
open
.

Industry
observers
have
congratulated
Mr.
Lang
on
what
some
call
his
``
courageous
''
handling
of
Ms.
,
but
his
track
record
in
magazine
publishing
in
general
has
gotten
mixed
reviews
.

Besides
Ms.
and
Sassy
,
closely
held
Lang
Communications
includes
Success
,
a
magazine
for
entrepreneurs
and
small
businesses
,
and
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
,
two
monthly
magazines
.

Working
Woman
,
with
circulation
near
one
million
,
and
Working
Mother
,
with
625,000
circulation
,
are
legitimate
magazine
success
stories
.

The
magazine
Success
,
however
,
was
for
years
lackluster
and
unfocused
.

Only
recently
has
it
been
attractively
redesigned
and
its
editorial
product
improved
.

Success
is
expected
to
gain
at
least
because
of
the
recent
folding
of
rival
Venture
,
another
magazine
for
growing
companies
.

Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
have
operated
as
part
of
Working
's
Group
,
a
less-than-successful
joint
venture
between
Mr.
Lang
and
Time
Warner
Inc
.

The
joint
venture
is
being
undone
,
with
McCall
's
magazine
being
sold
last
summer
to
the
New
York
Times
Co.
's
Magazine
Group
for
about
$
80
million
,
and
Time
Warner
agreeing
to
sell
back
its
50
%
interest
in
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
to
Mr.
Lang
.

Executives
at
Time
Inc
.

Magazine
Co.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Time
Warner
,
have
said
the
joint
venture
with
Mr.
Lang
was
n't
a
good
one
.

The
venture
,
formed
in
1986
,
was
supposed
to
be
Time
's
low-cost
,
safe
entry
into
women
's
magazines
.

Mr.
Lang
surprised
Time
soon
after
joining
forces
when
he
said
he
would
negotiate
rates
individually
with
advertisers
,
a
practice
common
in
broadcasting
but
considered
taboo
by
magazine
publishers
.

In
addition
,
McCall
's
put
in
a
less
than
stellar
performance
.

Until
a
recent
comeback
,
it
saw
steep
losses
in
ad
pages
and
circulation
.

Time
executives
complained
about
the
shoddy
editorial
quality
,
and
in
the
end
,
one
Time
executive
who
asked
not
to
be
identified
said
,
``
Frankly
,
McCall
's
and
the
joint
venture
were
an
embarrassment
.

''
Mr.
Lang
feels
that
Time
's
priorities
changed
.

``
Their
management
changed
right
after
{
the
venture
was
formed
}
,
and
I
do
n't
think
they
were
comfortable
getting
into
the
competitive
wars
of
women
's
service
magazines
.

''
Today
,
Mr.
Lang
believes
his
magazines
will
offer
what
many
women
's
magazines
do
n't
.

``
We
write
straight
for
women
on
their
level
,
''
he
said
.

``
We
do
n't
have
passive
readers
.

''
Mr.
Lang
points
out
that
even
Success
,
in
part
,
fits
the
company
's
image
,
since
about
30
%
of
its
readership
is
female
.

Mr.
Lang
has
named
Carol
Taber
,
43
,
as
group
publisher
of
New
York-based
Lang
Communications
.

She
will
oversee
Working
Woman
,
Working
Mother
and
Success
magazines
,
and
retain
her
post
as
publisher
of
Working
Woman
.

The
sale
price
of
McCall
's
--
twice
what
Mr.
Lang
originally
paid
for
it
--
will
finance
Lang
Communications
'
buy-back
of
Time
Warner
's
50
%
interest
in
Working
Woman
and
Working
Mother
.

Mr.
Lang
says
he
is
n't
scouting
new
acquisitions
,
at
least
for
now
.

``
We
would
have
to
go
outside
to
banks
to
get
the
money
and
I
am
not
ready
to
do
that
,
''
he
said
.

``
Besides
,
we
have
enough
on
our
plate
.

There
is
plenty
of
work
to
be
done
on
what
we
have
.

Britain
's
Monopolies
and
Mergers
Commission
Wednesday
cleared
Rhone-Poulenc
S.A.
's
purchase
of
a
specialty
bulk-chemical
unit
from
Monsanto
Co.
,
saying
the
purchase
was
unlikely
to
have
any
lasting
impact
on
U.K.
industrial
consumers
.

The
commission
,
which
was
asked
to
study
the
deal
by
the
Department
of
Trade
and
Industry
after
its
announcement
in
February
,
said
the
diversity
of
global
supply
of
chemicals
used
in
making
analgesic
drugs
was
great
enough
to
offset
the
dominant
U.K.
market
share
Rhone-Poulenc
would
gain
through
the
acquisition
.

The
French
chemical
giant
would
hold
an
80
%
share
of
the
U.K.
market
for
salicylic
acid
,
methyl
salicylate
and
bulk
aspirin
.

The
commission
found
that
if
the
British
government
attempted
to
block
the
merger
,
Rhone-Poulenc
would
likely
respond
by
closing
the
salicylates
plant
Monsanto
operates
in
Wales
,
removing
the
matter
from
U.K.
jurisdiction
.

Morrison

7.9
million
,

concern
posted
a

of
$
51.2

In

Morrison
said
the

performed
well
,
with

operations
making
important

Boise

Idaho-based
Morrison
had
losses
totaling
$
186
million
over
the
two
years
ended
in
December
,
but
it
has
surged
back
to
profitability
as
a
result
of
cost-cutting
and
shedding
of
unprofitable
operations
.

In
the
nine

,
the

's
net
income
was
$
21.5

The
House
Ethics
Committee
officially
cited
Rep.
Jim
Bates
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
for
sexually
harassing
two
female
employees
,
but
did
n't
recommend
formal
disciplinary
action
.

Rep.
Bates
said
he
accepted
the
finding
,
but
one
of
the
victims
,
Dorena
Bertussi
,
denounced
the
ethics
panel
's
action
as
``
absurd
.

''
Acting
more
than
a
year
after
Ms.
Bertussi
filed
a
complaint
,
the
panel
issued
a
``
letter
of
reproval
''
saying
Rep.
Bates
had
admitted
conduct
that
violated
a
House
rule
forbidding
discrimination
against
employees
on
account
of
their
sex
.

It
ordered
Rep.
Bates
to
write
letters
of
apology
to
Ms.
Bertussi
and
to
a
second
complainant
,
Karen
Dryden
.

Rep.

letters
as
ordered
.

``
I
accept
the
resolution

warned

that
any
further
violations
``
may
result
in
a
recommendation

But
Ms.

Rep.

Mesa
Airlines
said
the
takeover
offer
it
received
earlier
this
week
from
StatesWest
Airlines
is
for
a
combination
of
cash
and
securities
valued
by
StatesWest
at
$
10
a
Mesa
share
.

Both
companies
are
regional
carriers
in
the
Southwest
.

When
it
made
the
offer
,
StatesWest
declined
to
disclose
details
and
asked
Mesa
to
do
the
same
.

But
Farmington
,
N.M.-based
Mesa
said
the
offer
was
for
$
7
in
cash
and
unspecified
StatesWest
securities
valued
at
$
3
a
share
.

Based
on
the
number
of
Mesa
shares
outstanding
not
already
owned
by
StatesWest
,
the
proposed
takeover
would
have
a
value
of
about
$
15.3
million

StatesWest
owns
7.25
%
of
Mesa
.

Last
week

rejected

two

combine

In

to
the
specific
offer
,
Gary
Risley
,
Mesa
vice
president
,
said
management
will
ask
directors
to
employ
a
financial
consultant
to
advise
them
.

it

been
only

hurt

Franklin
Federal
Savings
&
Loan
Association
said
it
expects
to
post
a
third-quarter
net
loss
of
about
$
8
million
,
or
$
1.04
a
share
,
as
a
result
of
adding
$
11
million
in
loan-loss
reserves
.

The
Portland
,
Ore.
,
thrift
,
which
has
$
5.2
billion
of
assets
,
had
net
income
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
of
$
1.8
million
,
or
23
cents
a
share
.

Franklin
said
it
expects
to
report
earnings
for
the
latest
quarter
next
week
.

The
additional
reserves
relate
to
possible
write-downs
of
certain
assets
held
by
Franklin
and
its
subsidiaries
and
the
default
of
a
bond
in
its
investment
portfolio
,
the
thrift
said
.

According
to
a
spokeswoman
,
they
also
relate
to
changes
Franklin
will
have
to
make
in
its
accounting
procedures
to
comply
with
new
federal
capitalization
requirements
for
thrifts
.

The

Arkla
Inc.
said
that
as
part
of
a
program
to
improve
profitability
it
will
take
a
total
of
$
189
million
in
after-tax
charges
by
year
end
.

It
also
announced
an
initial
public
offering
of
18
%
of
its
gas
exploration
and
production
subsidiary
.

The
Shreveport
,
La.
,
natural
gas
company
said
the
charges
,
though
partially
offset
by
a
one-time
gain
from
the
offering
,
will
result
in
a
full-year
after-tax
loss
.

Last
year
,
the
company
had
net
income
of
$
117.3
million
,
or
$
1.30
a
share
.

Arkla
said
it
will
report
$
179
milllion
in
one-time
charges
against
continuing
operations
for
the
third
quarter
,
reflecting
settlement
of
certain
natural
gas
contracts
.

It
said
it
will
take
a
$
10
million
fourth-quarter
charge
against
discontinued
operations
,
reflecting
certain
write-downs
and
the
planned
sale
of
a
unit
.

Arkla
said
its
initial
offering
of
18
%
of
Arkla
Exploration
Co.
is
expected
to
result
in
a
net
gain
of
about
$
90
million
,
which
will
be
used
to
pay
down
Arkla
debt
.

Arkla
Exploration
owns
sizable
gas
and
crude-oil
reserves
in
the
South
and
Southwest

South
Africa
negotiated
a
new
debt
agreement
with
its
major
foreign
creditors
for
about
$
8
billion
of
its
foreign
debt
outstanding
,
said
Chris
Stals
,
governor
of
the
Reserve
Bank
and
the
country
's
chief
debt
negotiator
.

The
new
agreement
will
last
for
3
years
starting
July
1
,
1990
,
when
the
current
agreement
expires
.

The
announcement
coincides
with
the
start
of
the
Commonwealth
Ministers
Conference
in
Kuala
Lumpur
,
where
proposals
for
renewed
sanctions
against
South
Africa
,
including
moves
to
block
settling
of
a
new
debt
agreement
,
were
scheduled
to
be
discussed
.

As
with
the
previous
pact
,
the
new
agreement
covers
the
country
's
debt
``
inside
the
net
,
''
which
applies
mainly
to
repayments
due
to
overseas
creditor
banks
by
the
private
sector
.

The
agreement
calls
for
South
African
debtors
to
make
repayments
in
eight
installments
,
starting
in
December
of
next
year
.

The
redemption
then
would
be
at
1.5
%
of
the
total
debt
,
increasing
to
2.5
%
in
February
1991
,
and
to
3
%
at
six-month
intervals
thereafter
.

A
revised
provision
would
be
included
for
the
conversion
of
short-term
claims
inside
the
net
to
long-term
loans
outside
the
net
.

These
claims
would
be
repayable
over
a
10-year
period
.

Foreign
debt
falling
outside
the
net
of
affected
indebtedness
--
which
Mr.
Stahl
estimated
at
$
12
billion
--
would
remain
not
subject
to
the
debt
arrangements
.

New
York
Times
Co.
said
net
income
rose
in
the
third
quarter
because
of
a
one-time
gain
on
the
sale
of
the
company
's
cable-TV
system
.

Net
surged
to
$
210.8
million
,
or
$
2.68
a
share
,
from
$
26.7
million
,
or
33
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
193.3
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
,
from
the
sale
of
New
York
Times
Cable
,
completed
in
August
.

Exclusive
of
the
gain
,
operating
profit
declined
35
%
to
$
16.4
million
,
or
21
cents
a
share
,
from
$
25.2
million
,
or
31
cents
a
share
.

The
decline
primarily
reflected
the
dilution
from
acquiring
McCall
's
,
Golf
World
(
U.S.
)
and
Sailing
World
magazines
;
lower
equity
earnings
from
the
forest-products
group
because
of
price
discounting
and
an
unfavorable
exchange
rate
,
and
an
8.7
%
decline
in
advertising
linage
at
the
New
York
Times
,
the
company
's
flagship
newspaper
.

Advertising
volume
at
the
company
's
35
regional
newspapers
decreased
1.1
%
.

The
company
said
the
negative
factors
are
expected
to
continue
into
next
year
.

Revenue
rose
6.4
%
to
$
415.3
million
from
$
390.5
million
.

Democrat
Gene
Taylor
won
a
special
election
to
fill
the
congressional
seat
vacated
by
the
death
of
Republican
Larkin
Smith
,
taking
back
the
GOP
's
lone
redoubt
in
Mississippi
's
House
delegation
.

Mr.
Taylor
's
overwhelming
victory
against
Republican
Tom
Anderson
reclaims
a
seat
the
Republicans
had
held
for
17
years
and
gives
the
Democrats
their
fifth
victory
in
the
seven
special
House
elections
held
this
year
.

Mr.
Taylor
,
a
36-year-old
state
senator
from
Bay
St.
Louis
,
won
65
%
of
the
vote
in
a
district
that
has
voted
Republican
in
the
past
five
presidential
elections
and
that
was
once
represented
by
Republican
U.S.
Sen.
Trent
Lott
.

Mr.
Taylor
's
victory
was
an
embarrassment
for
both
state
and
national
Republicans
.

Mr.
Anderson
,
a
former
Lott
aide
,
received
campaign
assistance
from
the
senator
and
from
President
Bush
,
who
visited
the
district
last
week
.

Even
so
,
Mr.
Taylor
carried
all
but
one
of
the
district
's
dozen
counties
.

Rep.
Smith
died
in
a

Could
the
collapse
of
I-880
have
been
prevented
?
That
was
the
question
structural
engineers
and
California
transportation
officials
were
asking
themselves
yesterday
as
rescue
workers
began
the
gruesome
task
of
trying
to
extract
as
many
as
250
victims
from
beneath
the
concrete
slabs
of
the
double-deck
Nimitz
Freeway
in
Oakland
that
caved
in
during
Tuesday
's
temblor
.

After
touring
the
area
,
California
Gov.
George
Deukmejian
late
yesterday
called
for
an
inquiry
into
the
freeway
's
collapse
,
blaming
the
disaster
on
substandard
construction
,
the
Associated
Press
reported
.

The
impact
of
the
destruction
of
this
2.5-mile
stretch
of
highway
was
tragically
measured
in
lost
lives
.

But
there
are
other
long-term
effects
that
raise
serious
questions
about
the
ability
of
California
's
infrastructure
to
withstand
a
major
temblor
.

It
could
easily
be
two
years
before
the
well-traveled
artery
that
helps
connect
Oakland
with
San
Francisco
is
reopened
,
and
the
cost
to
build
a
new
stretch
of
highway
could
soar
to
more
than
$
250
million
,
said
Charles
J.
O'Connell
,
deputy
district
director
in
Los
Angeles
of
the
California
Department
of
Transportation
,
nicknamed
Caltrans
.

Caltrans
in
Sacramento
said
total
damage
from
the
collapsed
highway
is
estimated
at
around
$
500
million
.

The
aftershocks
of
the
highway
tragedy
are
reverberating
in
Los
Angeles
as
well
,
as
local
politicians
spoke
yesterday
against
plans
to
bring
double-decking
to
Los
Angeles
freeways
by
1994
.

Caltrans
plans
to
add
a
second
deck
for
buses
and
car
pools
above
the
median
of
a
2.5-mile
stretch
of
the
Harbor
Freeway
just
south
of
Los
Angeles
,
near
the
Memorial
Coliseum
.

Los
Angeles
County
Supervisor
Kenneth
Hahn
yesterday
vowed
to
fight
the
introduction
of
double-decking
in
the
area
.

Caltrans
abandoned
double-decking
in
the
early
1970s
,
following
the
1971
Sylmar
earthquake
that
destroyed
freeway
sections
just
north
of
Los
Angeles
,
Mr.
O'Connell
explained
.

That
temblor
measured
6.1
on
the
Richter
scale
;
Tuesday
's
was
So
why
even
consider
stacking
freeways
now
?
``
We
've
run
out
of
places
to
build
freeways
in
L.A.
,
and
the
only
place
to
go
is
up
,
''
Mr.
O'Connell
said
,
although
he
acknowledges
there
are
many
obstacles
,
including
cost
.

But
as
for
safety
,
he
says
double-deck
freeways
built
today
with
the
heavily
reinforced
concrete
and
thicker
columns
required
after
the
Sylmar
quake
should
withstand
a
calamitous
temblor
of
7.5
to
8
on
the
Richter
scale
.

Reasons
for
the
collapse
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
were
sketchy
yesterday
.

But
most
structural
engineers
attributed
the
destruction
to
improper
reinforcement
of
the
columns
that
supported
the
decks
,
and
the
fact
that
the
ground
beneath
the
highway
is
largely
landfill
and
can
become
unstable
,
or
``
liquefy
,
''
in
a
major
quake
.

The
two-story
roadway
,
designed
in
the
mid-1940s
and
completed
in
1957
,
was
supported
by
columns
that
apparently
lacked
the
kind
of
steel
reinforcement
used
in
highways
today
.

While
the
pillars
did
have
long
metal
bars
running
vertically
through
them
for
reinforcement
,
they
apparently
lacked
an
adequate
number
of
metal
``
ties
''
that
run
horizontally
through
the
column
,
said
Leo
Parker
,
a
structural
engineer
in
Los
Angeles
.

Caltrans
today
uses
a
variation
of
the
design
Mr.
Parker
describes
,
with
spiraling
steel
rods
inside
.

But
in
the
case
of
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
the
lack
of
such
support
caused
the
core
of
the
columns
to
crumble
and
buckle
under
the
weight
of
the
second
deck
,
crushing
motorists
who
were
lined
up
in
bumper-to-bumper
rush-hour
traffic
on
the
lower
deck
nearly
15
feet
below
.

Officials
of
the
state
agency
did
n't
have
any
immediate
explanation
why
the
reinforcement
did
n't
hold
up
.

Caltrans
reinforced
the
highway
in
1977
as
part
of
a
$
55
million
statewide
project
,
using
steel
cables
to
tie
the
decks
of
the
freeway
to
the
columns
and
prevent
the
structure
from
swaying
in
a
quake
.

Caltrans
spokesman
Jim
Drago
in
Sacramento
declined
to
identify
the
engineering
firm
that
did
the
reinforcement
work
.

Liability
in
the
bridge
and
road
collapses
will
revolve
around
whether
government
took
``
reasonable
care
''
to
build
and
maintain
the
structures
,
says
John
Messina
,
a
Tacoma
,
Wash.
,
personal-injury
attorney
who
specializes
in
highway
design
and
maintenance
cases
.

The
firm
brought
in
to
strengthen
the
structure
could
be
liable
as
well
.

The
results
of
the
quake
certainly
raise
questions
about
whether
reasonable
care
was
taken
,
Mr.
Messina
says
.

Given
the
seismic
history
of
the
Bay
Area
,
``
it
seems
to
me
that
a
6.9
earthquake
is
a
foreseeable
event
.

''
Caltrans
'
Mr.
Drago
defended
the
agency
's
work
on
the
Nimitz
Freeway
.

``
The
work
was
done
properly
,
''
he
said
.

``
Basically
,
we
had
a
severe
earthquake
of
significant
duration
and
it
was
just
something
the
structure
could
n't
withstand
.

''
Ironically
,
Caltrans
this
year
began
working
on
a
second
round
of
seismic
reinforcements
of
freeways
around
the
state
,
this
time
wrapping
freeway
columns
in
``
steel
blankets
''
to
reinforce
them
.

But
only
bridges
supported
with
single
rows
of
columns
were
top
priority
,
and
the
Nimitz
Freeway
,
supported
by
double
rows
,
was
left
out
,
Mr.
Drago
explained
.

``
The
reason
is
that
the
technology
is
such
that
we
're
not
able
to
retrofit
multi-column
structures
,

he
said
.

Lionel
Corp.
's
board
unanimously
rejected
a
tender
offer
of
$
8
a
share
,
or
$
95.4
million
,
for
as
much
as
90
%
of
Lionel
by
a
group
with
a
9.9
%
stake
in
the
toy
retailer
.

Lionel
also
urged
holders
of
its
stock
and
debt
not
to
tender
their
securities
,
saying
it
wants
to
remain
independent
to
pursue
its
business
strategy
.

Lionel
also
said
the
offer
by
Robert
I.
Toussie
Limited
Partnership
is
inadequate
,
and
full
of
conditions
that
leave
it
``
subject
to
substantial
uncertainty
.

''
In
addition
,
Lionel
began
a
lawsuit
in
federal
District
Court
in
New
York
seeking
to
enjoin
the
offer
,
alleging
,
among
other
things
,
violations
of
federal
securities
law
and
fraudulent
manipulation
of
the
market
for
Lionel
's
securities
.

Robert
I.
Toussie
,
general
partner
of
the
investment
group
,
said
the
Lionel
response
reflected
management
's
entrenched
position
,
saying
officials
had
failed
to
come
up
with
a
better
alternative
to
his
group
's
offer
.

Mr.
Toussie
said
he
would
respond
to
Lionel
's
suit
after
his
lawyers
review
it
.

Efforts
by
a
federal
mediator
to
reignite
talks
between
Boeing
Co.
and
the
Machinists
union
apparently
failed
,
and
no
further
meetings
are
scheduled
.

Company
officials
and
union
representatives
did
n't
meet
face
to
face
,
but
the
mediator
shuttled
between
the
two
groups
.

In
a
statement
issued
after
the
meeting
,
the
aerospace
giant
said
it
wo
n't
increase
its
offer
although
adjustments
within
the
proposed
pay-and-benefit
mix
are
possible
.

Machinists
already
have
rejected
a
proposal
that
called
for
a
4
%
pay
increase
and
8
%
bonus
in
the
first
year
.

In
the
second
year
,
workers
would
receive
a
3
%
wage
boost
and
a
3
%
bonus
,
followed
by
a
3
%
increase
without
a
bonus
in
the
third
year
.

``
The
company
will
not
budge
on
anything
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
the
union
.

As
the
strike
enters
its
15th
day
today
,
some
members
are
getting
nervous
,
the
spokesman
conceded
,
but
the
majority
of
the
55,000
Machinists
are
prepared
to
``
wait
it
out
as
long
as
it
takes
.

''
United
Merchants
&
Manufacturers
Inc.
said
its
president
,
Uzi
Ruskin
,
withdrew
his
proposal
to
acquire
control
of
the
New
York
textile
and
clothing
company
.

Last
month
,
Mr.
Ruskin
proposed
,
among
other
things
,
to
buy
3.5
million
shares
,
or
38
%
,
for
$
4
apiece
.

Coupled
with
his
current
1.2
million
shares
and
4
%
held
by
an
associate
,
the
stake
would
have
given
him
control
of
55
%
of
the
concern
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
Mr.
Ruskin
had
said
that
holders
of
the
other
45
%
of
United
Merchants
would
receive
one-half
share
of
a
new
preferred
stock
for
each
of
their
shares
.

A
special
committee
of
United
Merchants
directors
said
that
in
view
of
uncertainties
regarding
various
legal
and
financial
considerations
,
it
could
n't
recommend
the
plan
to
the
full
board
.

The
company
is
exploring
,
with
a
major
financial
institution
,
the
development
of
a
plan
to
boost
the
value
of
the
company
for
its
holders
,
Mr.
Ruskin
said
.

In
a
separate
SEC
filing
,
Albert
Safer
,
who
holds
6.46
%
of
United
Merchants
,
said
he
retained
investment
bank
Lazard
Freres
&
Co.
for
advice
as
he
evaluates
the
possibility
of
making
a
bid
for
the
textile
maker
.

On
Friday
,
Mr.
Safer
,
a
Newark
,
N.J.
,
textile
businessman
,
signed
a
confidentiality
agreement
under
which
United
Merchants
would
provide
him
with
nonpublic
information
.

The
White
House
is
making
sure
nobody
will
accuse
it
of
taking
this
crisis
lightly
.

In
the
aftermath
of
the
California
earthquake
,
President
Bush
and
his
aides
flew
into
a
whirlwind
of
earthquake-related
activity
yesterday
morning
.

Some
of
it
was
necessary
to
get
federal
help
flowing
to
victims
,
but
some
seemed
designed
mostly
to
project
an
image
of
a
White
House
in
action
.

Mr.
Bush
and
his
aides
were
accused
of
responding
too
slowly
after
the
Exxon
Valdez
oil
tanker
split
open
in
Alaskan
waters
and
Hurricane
Hugo
struck
the
Carolina
coast
,
and
they
clearly
do
n't
want
a
repeat
of
those
charges
now
.

So
the
White
House
announced
that
Mr.
Bush
got
his
first
earthquake
briefing
of
the
day
at
6:30
a.m.
from
chief
of
staff
John
Sununu
.

By
noon
,
Mr.
Bush
had
taken
two
phone
calls
from
Vice
President
Dan
Quayle
,
who
was
in
California
;
made
a
televised
statement
of
concern
;
signed
a
disaster
proclamation
;
received
a
written
report
from
the
Federal
Emergency
Management
Agency
;
and
visited
FEMA
headquarters
.

Mr.
Bush
himself
essentially
acknowledged
that
he
and
his
aides
were
trying
to
head
off
criticism
.

On
his
FEMA
visit
,
Mr.
Bush
said
that
he
hoped
there
would
be
``
less
carping
''
about
the
emergency
office
's
performance
this
time
,
adding
that
the
agency
``
took
a
hit
''
for
its
reaction
to
Hurricane
Hugo
.

The
White
House
already
is
talking
of
Mr.
Bush
visiting
the
California
earthquake
site
this
weekend
.

He
visited
the
Hugo
devastation
but
not
until
after
local
leaders
urged
him
to
do
so
.

Beazer
PLC
,
a
major
British
building
materials
and
construction
concern
,
reported
a
24
%
jump
in
pretax
profit
for
its
latest
financial
year
,
helped
largely
by
contributions
from
its
U.S.
unit
,
Koppers
Co
.

Pretax
profit
for
the
year
to
June
30
rose
to
#
142.5
million
(
$
224.5
million
)
from
#
114.7
million
(
$
180.7
million
)
,
broadly
matching
analysts
'
expectations
.

Profit
after
taxes
and
minority
interests
but
before
extraordinary
items
increased
22
%
to
#
92.6
million
from
#
75.6
million
a
year
earlier
,
while
fully
diluted
earnings
per
share
rose
to
29.90
pence
(
47
cents
)
from
24.68
pence
(
39
cents
)
.

The
lethal
shudders
that
wracked
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
--
rated
a
6.9
on
the
Richter
scale
--
did
n't
match
the
great
earthquake
of
1906
,
rated
at
8.25
.

The
difference
of
just
1.35
points
on
the
scale
,
designed
by
Charles
Richter
of
CalTech
in
the
1930s
,
means
the
older
quake
was
``
10
to
20
times
stronger
,
''
says
Lane
Johnson
,
director
of
the
University
of
California
Berkeley
Seismographic
Station
.

The
ground
ruptured
along
a
20-to-30-mile
stretch
of
the
San
Andreas
Fault
on
Tuesday
,
Mr.
Johnson
added
.

In
1906
,
the
rupture
was
300
miles
long
and
a
couple
feet
wide
.

Though
the
epicenter
of
Tuesday
's
temblor
was
located
10
miles
north
of
the
town
of
Santa
Cruz
,
and
50
miles
south
of
San
Francisco
,
its
havoc
hopscotched
up
the
coast
in
seemingly
random
fashion
.

But
the
greatest
damage
was
visited
on
buildings
and
roadways
perched
upon
landfill
,
as
were
the
Marina
District
of
San
Francisco
and
the
Bay
Bridge
--
two
areas
of
maximum
devastation
.

``
Landfill
--
loose
and
unconsolidated
earth
--
may
feel
like
rock
but
it
behaves
like
liquid
when
you
shake
it
,
''
said
Douglas
Segar
,
professor
of
geosciences
at
San
Francisco
State
University
in
a
televised
interview
.

``
It
liquefies
in
a
patchwork
quilt
pattern
.

Our
quake
behaved
much
like
the
Mexico
City
earthquake
,
where
great
damage
was
miles
from
the
epicenter
.

''
Mr.
Johnson
,
of
the
Berkeley
seismographic
station
,
said
:
``
Landfill
can
be
done
if
it
's
properly
compacted
.

You
can
drive
piles
on
it
and
build
on
it
.

''
He
cited
the
example
of
San
Francisco
's
financial
district
,
where
many
new
glass
towers
survived
almost
unscathed
.

But
the
public
policy
issues
raised
by
earthquake
damage
will
be
difficult
to
address
,
Mr.
Johnson
predicted
.

``
The
attention
span
of
the
public
is
short
,
''
he
said
.

``
We
've
known
for
years
and
years
we
've
got
lots
of
old
{
pre-1950s
}
unreinforced
brick
and
masonry
buildings
.

''
One
old
building
,
the
Golden
State
Bank
Building
on
Front
Street
,
had
its
yellow
brick
facade
sheared
off
by
the
shock
of
the
quake
,
leaving
a
wedge
of
its
third
floor
open
to
the
air
,
while
piles
of
dusty
bricks
tumbled
to
the
street
below
narrowly
missing
rush-hour
pedestrians
and
cars
.

Reinforcing
such
old
building
stock
,
Mr.
Johnson
said
,
``
comes
down
to
money
.

It
's
a
danger
.

We
know
it
's
there
.

And
sooner
or
later
,
we
have
to
do
something
about
it
.

''
The
urgency
is
heightened
because
this
week
's
earthquake
--
while
major
and
followed
by
hundreds
of
aftershocks
--
did
n't
release
enough
pent-up
energy
tension
along
the
faultlines
to
preclude
more
and
bigger
quakes
soon
.

``
The
big
one
is
still
due
,
''
Mr.
Johnson
predicted
in
an
interview
.

``
The
Bay
Area
has
three
very
dangerous
faults
,
the
San
Andreas
,
the
Hayward
fault
and
the
Calaveras
fault
.

It
{
Tuesday
's
quake
}
has
n't
solved
our
problem
.

In
California
,
this
is
the
reality
.

''
Coca-Cola
Co.
may
be
about
to
intensify
the
cola
wars
.

Coke
said
it
will
test
market
a
caffeine-free
version
of
its
flagship
brand
,
Coca-Cola
Classic
,
beginning
next
week
in
Charlotte
,
N.C
.

Other
,
as
yet
unnamed
,
cities
will
follow
.

If
all
goes
well
,
the
product
will
be
rolled
out
for
national
sales
sometime
next
year
,
a
Coke
spokesman
said
.

After
the
confusion
surrounding
the
change
of
the
Coke
formula
in
1985
,
Coca-Cola
was
reluctant
to
clutter
the
Classic
name
with
a
brand
extension
.

But
now
,
the
soft-drink
giant
appears
willing
to
take
the
risk
.

``
The
name
Classic
Coke
has
tremendous
value
,
and
they
have
n't
merchandised
that
name
before
,
''
says
Jesse
Meyers
,
publisher
of
the
trade
journal
Beverage
Digest
.

The
Coke
spokesman
said
a
caffeine-free
Classic
should
help
increase
volume
of
the
original
brand
.

Indeed
,
analysts
have
said
that
the
absence
of
new
products
,
among
other
factors
,
has
limited
sales
growth
throughout
the
industry
.

Coke
now
leads
Pepsi
in
market
share
in
caffeine-free
diet
colas
but
trails
Pepsi
in
sales
of
caffeine-free
sugared
colas
,
according
to
Beverage
Digest
.

Coke
introduced
a
caffeine-free
sugared
cola
based
on
its
original
formula
in
1983
.

It
switched
to
a
caffeine-free
formula
using
its
new
Coke
in
1985
.

Coke
has
been
studying
the
possibility
of
introducing
a
caffeine-free
Classic
for
a
year
,
a
company
spokesman
said
.

He
said
large
increases
in
sales
of
other
non-caffeine
soft
drinks
make
the
timing
right
now
.

CALIFORNIA
STRUGGLED
with
the
aftermath
of
a
Bay
area
earthquake
.

As
aftershocks
shook
the
San
Francisco
Bay
area
,
rescuers
searched
through
rubble
for
survivors
of
Tuesday
's
temblor
,
and
residents
picked
their
way
through
glass-strewn
streets
.

In
Oakland
,
hopes
faded
for
finding
any
more
survivors
within
the
concrete
and
steel
from
the
collapse
of
an
interstate
highway
.

At
least
270
people
were
reported
killed
and
1,400
injured
in
the
rush-hour
tremor
that
caused
billions
of
dollars
of
damage
along
100
miles
of
the
San
Andreas
fault
.

Bush
declared
the
region
a
major
disaster
area
and
the
military
was
mobilized
to
prevent
looting
.

The
baseball
commissioner
said
the
third
game
of
the
World
Series
between
the
Giants
and
the
Athletics
would
be
played
Tuesday
in
Candlestick
Park
.

HONECKER
WAS
OUSTED
as
leader
of
East
Germany
amid
growing
unrest
.

The
77-year-old
official
,
who
oversaw
the
building
of
the
Berlin
Wall
,
was
removed
during
a
meeting
of
the
163-member
Communist
Party
Central
Committee
in
East
Berlin
.

Honecker
,
who
was
reported
ill
following
gall-bladder
surgery
in
August
,
said
he
was
resigning
for
health
reasons
.

He
was
succeeded
by
internal-security
chief
Egon
Krenz
,
52
,
a
hard-liner
who
quickly
ruled
out
any
sharing
of
power
with
pro-democracy
groups
.

Honecker
's
departure
came
after
weeks
of
street
protests
and
an
exodus
to
the
West
of
East
Germans
who
had
become
disenchanted
with
his
rule
.

HUNGARY
ADOPTED
constitutional
changes
to
form
a
democratic

At
a
nationally
televised
legislative
session
in
Budapest
,
the
Parliament
overwhelmingly
approved
changes
formally
ending
one-party
domination
in
the
country
,
regulating
free
elections
by
next
summer
and
establishing
the
office
of
state
president
to
replace
a
21-member
council
.

The
country
was
renamed
the
Republic
of
Hungary
.

Like
other
Soviet
bloc
nations
,
it
had
been
known
as
a
``
people

since
The
voting
for
new
laws
followed
dissolution
of
Hungary
's
Communist
Party
this
month
and
its
replacement
by
a
Western-style
Socialist
Party

Dow
Chemical
Co.
said
third-quarter
net
income
slipped
6.8
%
from
a
record
year-ago
quarter
.

The
decline
broke
a
streak
of
10
quarters
in
which
Dow
posted
earnings
increases
.

Dow
's
third-quarter
net
fell
to
$
589
million
,
or
$
3.29
a
share
,
from
$
632
million
,
or
$
3.36
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

Sales
in
the
latest
quarter
rose
2
%
to
$
4.25
billion
from
$
4.15
billion
a
year
earlier
.

Dow
closed
at
$
94.625
a
share
,
up
75
cents
,
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
.

A
spokeswoman
said
Dow
is
comfortable
with
Wall
Street
expectations
that
full-year
earnings
will
total
about
$
14.60
a
share
,
compared
with
last
year
's
record
net
of
$
2.4
billion
,
or
$
12.76
a
share
.

But
that
signal
on
full-year
profit
casts
doubt
on
whether
Dow
will
improve
on
its
year-ago
fourth-quarter
net
of
$
3.44
a
share
,
or
$
635
million
.

Dow
would
earn
$
14.85
a
share
for
the
year
if
it
equaled
that
year-ago
fourth-quarter
performance
.

Dow
officials
were
signaling
that
the
company
would
earn
less
than
$
15
a
share
this
year
even
before
they
announced
in
July
a
plan
to
acquire
67
%
of
Marion
Laboratories
Inc
.

That
acquisition
could
further
dilute
earnings
per
share
this
year
,
the
company
spokeswoman
said
.

Dow
has
n't
said
exactly
what
impact
the
Marion
acquisition
will
have
on
1989
earnings
.

Dow
blamed
the
third-quarter
earnings
drop
on
several
factors
,
including
softer
prices
for
polyethylene
and
other
basic
chemicals
,
a
slower
U.S.
economy
and
a
stronger
dollar
,
which
made
Dow
's
exports
from
the
U.S.
more
expensive
to
overseas
customers
.

Another
problem
was
a
7
%
increase
in
operating
costs
at
a
time
when
revenue
was
rising
by
only
2
%
.

For
the
first
nine
months
of
the
year
,
Dow
earned
$
2.06
billion
,
or
$
11.41
a
share
,
up
17
%
from
$
1.76
billion
,
or
$
9.32
a
share
,
a
year
ago
.

Sales
for
the
latest
nine
months
rose
7.7
%
to
$
13.34
billion
from
$
12.38
billion
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Whether
or
not
``
great
cases
make
bad-law
''
--
as
Justice
Holmes
asserted
--
who
can
doubt
that
when
great
confirmation
hearings
turn
on
the
nominee
's
response
to
these
great
cases
they
make
bad
judicial
history
?
Ethan
Bronner
's
``
Battle
for
Justice
:
How
the
Bork
Nomination
Shook
America
''
(
Norton
,
399
pages
,
$
22.50
)
is
a
spirited
narrative
of
the
nastiest
of
these
hearings
,
done
with
journalistic
verve
,
but
with
a
flawed
legal
philosophy
.

While
the
book
amply
justifies
its
subtitle
,
the
title
itself
is
dubious
.

What
shook
America
was
not
a
battle
for
justice
but
for
naked
power
,
in
which
an
army
of
judicial
activists
rolled
over
a
judge
they
had
demonized
.

In
its
basic
structure
and
style
the
book
is
novelistic
,
with
piquant
character
portrayal
,
hard-wire
action
and
devious
intrigue
of
the
sort
more
likely
to
be
encountered
in
a
Washington
docudrama
than
in
a
constitutional
history
.

Mr.
Bronner
seems
to
believe
that
the
hearings
could
have
gone
either
way
.

I
doubt
that
.

Given
Democratic
frustration
with
the
Reagan
victories
and
Court
appointments
,
the
contingency
plans
in
place
,
and
Mr.
Bork
's
paper
trail
of
vulnerable
writings
,
it
was
pretty
clear
that
Judge
Bork
never
stood
much
chance
of
being
confirmed
.

As
Mr.
Bronner
himself
says
,
the
smell
of
``
raw
meat
''
was
in
the
air
.

Perhaps
because
they
won
,
Mr.
Bork
's
attackers
come
through
more
vividly
than
his
defenders
.

Ralph
Neas
was
the
organizing
genius
,
whipping
a
conglomerate
of
pressure
groups
into
an
irresistible
attacking
force
.

Harvard
's
Laurence
Tribe
was
the
constitutional
heavy
,
laying
out
legal
strategies
for
the
senators
and
witnesses
to
follow
.

But
it
was
Ted
Kennedy
who
scored
most
effectively
with
his
searing
portrayal
of
``
Robert
Bork
's
America
''
--
the
parade
of
imaginary
horribles
that
would
follow
logically
,
he
claimed
,
from
the
positions
Mr.
Bork
had
taken
over
the
space
of
two
decades
.

Sen.
Kennedy
,
never
mind
his
dubious
credentials
for
the
moral
high
ground
,
emoted
brilliantly
.

I
add
two
others
.

Republican
Sen.
Arlen
Specter
of
Pennsylvania
engaged
the
nominee
in
a
verbal
contest
aimed
at
showing
that
Mr.
Bork
was
willing
to
stretch
the
Constitution
in
one
area
(
free
speech
)
while
remaining
rigid
in
all
the
others
.

It
achieved
a
good
media
play
,
and
enabled
Sen.
Specter
and
others
to
vote
against
Mr.
Bork
out
of
``
conscience
.

''
Further
ammunition
came
from
left
legal
theorist
Ronald
Dworkin
,
who
in
the
New
York
Review
of
Books
painted
a
picture
of
a
constitutional
zombie
willfully
reading
his
personal
prejudices
into
the
Constitution
,
particularly
in
the
area
of
``
original
intent
.

''
The
charge
of
being
``
outside
the
mainstream
''
of
legal
thought
gravely
undercut
Mr.
Bork
's
scholarly
standing
,
leaving
him
bleeding
on
the
platform
.

The
nomination
still
might
have
been
salvaged
if
a
number
of
Democratic
moderates
in
the
South
and
Southwest
had
broken
party
lines
.

But
Democratic
Sen.
Bennett
Johnson
of
Louisiana
reminded
the
little
band
that
anti-Bork
blacks
and
women
could
furnish
the
margin
to
punish
them
in
their
next
Senate
elections
.

Demographics
converged
with
``
mainstream
''
and
demonizing
to
seal
Robert
Bork
's
fate
.

The
upshot
?
Mr.
Bork
's
opponents
chose
the
battlefield
,
held
it
and
kept
it
.

Yet
with
the
smooth
confirmation
of
Anthony
Kennedy
,
an
``
80
percenter
''
only
slightly
less
supportive
of
judicial
restraint
than
Mr.
Bork
,
the
Democrats
may
have
won
the
battle
but
lost
the
war
.

Another
upshot
,
however
,
was
the
chilling
message
the
Bork
hearings
sent
into
the
judicial
culture
from
which
the
Supreme
Court
draws
its
talent
.

The
word
went
forth
to
every
law
school
that
those
with
federal
court
ambitions
must
travel
a
safe
constitutional
journey
,
with
no
paper
trail
and
no
bite
to
their
tongue
or
pen
.

Unfortunately
,
the
author
simply
does
n't
supply
the
philosophical
frame
to
sustain
his
reportorial
talents
.

He
has
too
readily
swallowed
the
case
for
the
activist
law
school
culture
.

Probing
more
deeply
into
the
doctrine
of
``
judicial
restraint
,
''
he
would
have
found
a
long
history
going
back
to
the
great
decisions
of
Justice
Holmes
.

He
would
discover
it
also
in
Alexander
Bickel
,
a
subtle
constitutional
scholar
,
Mr.
Bork
's
closest
friend
at
Yale
,
whose
influence
on
the
judge
goes
well
beyond
Mr.
Bronner
's
reporting
.

Still
,
the
long
view
of
Robert
Bork
as
constitutional
thinker
must
be
a
spotty
one
.

His
strength
lies
in
his
majoritarian
doctrine
,
which
keeps
the
Court
clear
of
transient
group
pressures
and
leaves
most
decisions
in
a
democracy
to
elected
legislatures
and
executives
.

Unfortunately
,
Mr.
Bork
failed
to
distinguish
between
such
pressures
and
the
emergence
of
great
issues
critical
to
a
society
that
must
be
settled
judicially
if
it
is
to
cohere
.

The
question
of
segregated
schools
,
in
Brown
vs.
Board
of
Education
,
was
such
an
issue
.

In
our
time
abortion
has
become
another
,
best
left
to
a
line
of
Supreme
Court
decisions
rather
than
to
the
chaos
of
50
state
legislatures
.

A
reflective
and
growing
consensus
of
Americans
clearly
wishes
to
apply
the
right
to
privacy
in
contraceptive
matters
(
decided
in
the
Griswold
case
)
to
abortion
as
well
.

One
can
understand
Mr.
Bork
's
fear
that
the
new
right
to
privacy
will
become
intolerably
stretched
,
though
a
Supreme
Court
composed
of
men
and
women
with
realism
,
guts
and
a
sense
of
limits
should
be
able
to
manage
it
.

What
is
certain
is
that
if
Americans
allow
another
happening
like
the
degrading
Bork
confirmation
circus
,
it
will
be
at
their
peril
.

Mr.

Sotheby
's
Inc.
,
the
world
's
biggest
auction
house
,
is
taking
a
huge
Wall
Street-style
risk
on
the
outcome
of
the
sale
of
art
from
the
estate
of
John
T.
Dorrance
Jr.
,
the
Campbell
Soup
Co.
heir
.

The
Financial
Services
division
has
guaranteed
the
Dorrance
family
that
it
will
receive
a
minimum
of
$
100
million
for
the
collection
,
regardless
of
what
the
bids
for
the
art
works
total
,
people
close
to
the
transaction
say
.

The
collection
,
which
includes
two
early
Picassos
,
a
van
Gogh
,
a
Monet
,
other
paintings
,
furniture
and
porcelains
,
went
on
sale
last
night
in
the
first
of
six
auctions
.

What
Sotheby
's
is
doing
closely
resembles
an
underwriting
by
an
investment
bank
.

A
corporation
that
wants
to
sell
stock
or
bonds
goes
to
a
Wall
Street
firm
,
which
purchases
the
securities
outright
,
accepting
the
financial
risk
of
finding
buyers
.

If
the
investment
bank
can
sell
the
securities
at
a
higher
price
than
it
paid
the
issuer
,
it
makes
a
profit
.

At
the
initial
sale
last
night
,
for
example
--
the
sale
featuring
the
Impressionists
masters
--
bids
totaled
$
116
million
.

That
was
slightly
above
Sotheby
's
presale
estimate
of
$
111
million
.

Normally
,
Sotheby
's
would
have
earned
20
%
of
the
total
in
commissions
.

Instead
,
people
familiar
with
the
transaction
said
,
the
auction
house
opted
to
forgo
that
percentage
in
order
to
obtain
the
collection
and
in
exchange
for
taking
a
bigger
chunk
of
proceeds
exceeding
$
100
million
.

Art
dealers
say
that
while
auction
houses
occasionally
guarantee
the
seller
of
a
highly
desirable
work
of
art
a
minimum
price
,
a
financial
commitment
of
this
size
is
unprecedented
.

Diana
D.
Brooks
,
president
of
Sotheby
's
North
America
division
,
vehemently
denies
it
offered
the
Dorrance
heirs
a
money-back
guarantee
,
calling
such
reports
``
inaccurate
.

''
Buried
in
the
glossy
hardbound
catalog
for
the
sale
,
however
,
appears
the
statement
,
``
Sotheby
's
has
an
interest
in
the
property
in
this
catalog
.

''
Explains
a
Sotheby
's
spokeswoman
,
the
statement
``
means
exactly
what
it
says
.

We
have
some
level
of
financial
interest
''
in
the
collection
.

``
We
do
n't
disclose
specifics

declines
to
comment
on
the
financial
arrangements
.

Sotheby
's
made
the
$
100
million
guarantee
to
keep
the
Dorrance
collection
away
from
its
archrival
,
auction
house
Christie
's
International
PLC
;
Christie
's
has
handled
smaller
sales
for
the
Dorrance
family
over
the
years
.

When
Christie
's
officials
asked
why
the
firm
was
n't
picked
to
sell
the
Dorrance
collection
,
representatives
of
the
Dorrance
family
``
told
us
it
was
a
question
of
financial
considerations
,
''
said
Michael
Findlay
,
Christie
's
head
of
impressionist
and
modern
paintings
.

Collectors
who
have
made
their
money
on
Wall
Street
have
become
an
increasingly
important
part
of
the
art
business
and
their
money
has
helped
fuel
the
art
boom
,
but
recently
it
appears
Sotheby
's
has
been
returning
the
compliment
.

In
November
1987
,
Sotheby
's
essentially
offered
a
Wall
Street-style
``
bridge
loan
''
of
about
$
27
million
to
Australian
businessman
Alan
Bond
to
enable
him
to
purchase
Vincent
van
Gogh
's
``
Irises
''
for
$
53.9
million
.

It
was
the
highest
bid
in
history
for
a
work
of
art
.

But
two
weeks
ago
,
Sotheby
's
said
that
it
has
the
painting
under
lock
and
key
because
the
loan
had
not
been
fully
repaid
.

Sotheby
's
is
offering
such
deals
because
it
's
an
art
sellers
'
market
,
at
least
where
the
best
works
are
concerned
,
says
Ralph
Lerner
,
an
attorney
and
author
of
the
book
``
Art
Law
.

''
``
There
seems
to
be
a
lot
of
art
for
sale
,
but
there
's
more
competition
.

The
competition
gives
the
seller
the
ability
to
cut
a
better
deal
,
''
he
says
.

The
Dorrance
family
will
still
receive
a
substantial
portion
of
the
auction
proceeds
above
$
100
million
,
people
familiar
with
the
transaction
said
.

But
it
's
likely
that
Sotheby
's
will
take
a
higher
than
usual
commission
,
called
an
override
,
on
the
amount
exceeding
the
guarantee
.

Sotheby
's
has
been
aggressively
promoting
the
Dorrance
sale
.

At
a
news
conference
last
May
announcing
plans
for
the
auction
,
Sotheby
's
estimated
its
value
in
excess
of
$
100
million
.

More
recently
,
Sotheby
's
has
predicted
the
collection
will
fetch
$
140
million
.

That
's
the
highest
estimate
for
a
single
collection
in
auction
history
.

The
decision
to
put
the
entire
collection
on
the
block
stunned
many
,
since
Mr.
Dorrance
had
served
as
chairman
of
the
Philadelphia
Museum
of
Art
,
and
it
had
been
assumed
many
of
the
works
would
be
donated
to
the
institution
.

At
last
night
's
sale
,
13
of
44
works
that
sold
were
purchased
by
Aska
International
Gallery
,
the
art-acquisition
unit
of
Aichi
Financial
,
a
Japanese
conglomerate
that
owns
7.5
%
of
Christie
's
.

Meanwhile
,
Sotheby
's
guarantee
is
raising
eyebrows
in
the
art
world
.

``
The
consumer
has
to
throw
out
the
idea
that
the
auction
house
is
a
disinterested
middleman
,
''
says
New
York
art
dealer
David
Tunick
.

While
he
adds
that
he
has
no
problem
with
auction
houses
who
sell
works
in
which
they
have
a
financial
interest
,
``
It
ought
not
to
be
hidden
in
some
small
print
.

''
In
such
situations
,
he
says
,
the
house
``
is
going
to
put
the
best
light
on
things
.

''
For
example
,
an
auction
house
's
comments
on
the
condition
of
a
work
of
art
that
is
up
for
sale
should
be
looked
at
with
``
very
open
eyes
,
''
he
says
.

``
There
's
more
and
more
of
this
cash-up-front
going
on
at
every
level
,
''
says
Bruce
Miller
,
president
of
Art
Funding
Corp.
,
an
art
lender
.

Dealers
and
auction
houses
``
know
if
they
do
n't
lay
out
a
half
a
million
for
this
,
another
one
will
;
it
's
that
competitive
.

''
In
January
,
two
small
New
York
galleries
,
the
Coe
Kerr
Gallery
and
Beadleston
Fine
Arts
,
snatched
a
major
art
collection
owned
by
the
Askin
family
away
from
rival
auction-house
bidders
with
an
up-front
payment
of
about
$
25
million
.

A
Christie
's
spokeswoman
said
that
while
the
auction
house
sometimes
waives
its
seller
's
commission
to
attract
art
works
--
it
still
gets
a
commission
from
the
buyer
--
Christie
's
wo
n't
offer
financial
guarantees
because
``
Christie
's
believes
its
primary
role
is
as
an
auction
house
,
and
therefore
as
an
agent
{
for
buyer
and
seller
}
,
not
as
a
bank
.

''
Egon
Krenz
,
the
man
tapped
yesterday
to
become
East
Germany
's
new
leader
,
faces
the
same
task
that
has
fallen
to
neighboring
socialist
colleagues
:
reforming
a
country
in
crisis
.

But
unlike
the
other
new
leaders
in
the
East
Bloc
,
Mr.
Krenz
will
face
an
immediate
threat
to
his
nation
's
very
existence
:
German
reunification
.

Mr.
Krenz
,
age
52
,
is
known
as
an
old-guard
ironfist
,
one
likely
to
continue
the
method
of
running
a
country
that
the
Berlin
Wall
made
famous
.

Even
if
he
were
to
change
his
stripes
and
become
another
Milton
Friedman
,
however
,
he
would
still
stand
a
good
chance
of
losing
a
country
.

Mr.
Krenz
almost
certainly
will
be
a
younger
version
of
Erich
Honecker
,
his
rigid
predecessor
as
dictator
.

Mr.
Krenz
has
followed
much
the
same
career
path
as
Mr.
Honecker
:
Both
spent
years
overseeing
the
Freie
Deutsche
Jugend
,
the
youth
group
that
is
the
communist
regime
's
principal
tool
for
stamping
young
Germans
into
socialist
citizens
.

More
recently
,
Mr.
Krenz
has
been
in
charge
of
East
German
security
,
and
is
the
youngest
member
of
the
ruling
Politburo
.

Faced
with
another
Mr.
Honecker
,
so
many
despairing
East
Germans
are
likely
to
flee
that
the
two
German
peoples
will
get
their
reunification
,
de
facto
,
on
West
German
ground
.

But
if
East
Germany
's
arthritic
Politburo
does
loosen
up
enough
to
permit
Mr.
Krenz
to
make
serious
efforts
at
reform
,
he
will
face
a
challenge
just
as
fundamental
.

Abandoning
socialism
means
abandoning
the
East
German
state
's
reason
for
existence
,
and
with
it
the
justification
for
its
watchdogs
and
its
Wall
.

In
this
scenario
it
's
hard
to
imagine
that
a
pale
imitation
of
the
Federal
Republic
could
avoid
being
pulled
into
some
kind
of
tie
--
economic
,
federal
or
stronger
--
with
West
Germany
.

Mr.
Krenz
may
need
a
bit
of
time
to
consolidate
his
empire
,
which
would
do
a
lot
to
promote
Reunification
Scenario
One
.

Cartoonists
in
West
Germany
have
already
mocked
the
exodus
by
imagining
an
advertisement
placed
by
Mr.
Honecker
:
``
Wanted
:
one
people
.

''
The
West
German
embassies
in
Prague
,
Budapest
and
Warsaw
are
continuing
to
find
refugees
at
their
gates
.

Of
course
East
Germany
,
true
to
its
tradition
,
could
tighten
its
borders
yet
further
.

Two
of
the
last
gestures
of
the
Honecker
regime
were
to
close
the
border
to
Czechoslovakia
and
install
halogen
lights
in
some
spots
along
the
frontier
.

But
with
world-wide
opinion
--
even
,
apparently
in
Moscow
--
against
East
Germany
,
the
country
would
have
to
turn
itself
into
an
Albania
to
clamp
down
further
on
refugees
.

There
have
been
some
reports
that
Mr.
Krenz
is
moving
to
``
soften
''
his
reputation
,
notably
rumors
that
it
was
he
who
kept
East
Germany
's
state
police
off
protesters
'
backs
at
the
country
's
dismal
40th
anniversary
celebrations
earlier
this
month
.

But
even
if
he
effects
a
Hyde-to-Jekyll
transformation
,
he
will
face
a
serious
ideological
crisis
and
Reunification
Scenario
Two
.

The
problem
is
one
that
East
Germany
shares
with
other
half-states
,
such
as
North
Korea
,
but
one
it
must
shoulder
alone
in
the
East
Bloc
.

When
Poland
moves
to
reform
,
it
can
at
least
lean
on
its
past
:
However
flawed
and
short-lived
Joseph
Pilsudski
's
interwar
republic
,
it
was
a
nonsocialist
democracy
.

Czech
reformers
can
recall
the
Wilsonian
ideals
of
the
same
period
in
their
country
.

Even
the
Soviet
Union
has
Peter
the
Great
to
rediscover
,
should
it
choose
to
.

But
East
Germany
is
merely
``
the
land
of
truly
existing
socialism
.

''
Beyond
that
,
it
has
to
compete
with
West
Germany
for
a
claim
to
the
German
identity
.

Up
to
now
,
the
main
weapon
of
the
``
worker
and
peasant
state
''
has
been
the
ideology
of
socialism
.

With
talk
today
of
a
second
economic
miracle
in
West
Germany
,
East
Germany
no
longer
can
content
itself
with
being
the
economic
star
in
a
loser
league
.

Without
Moscow
's
military
and
party
behind
it
,
East
Germany
runs
the
risk
of
disintegrating
.

If
it
goes
capitalist
,
and
increases
trade
with
West
Germany
,
it
will
convert
itself
,
willy-nilly
,
into
an
economic
annex
of
the
Federal
Republic
.

There
's
a
certain
cruel
logic
at
work
here
:
It
's
particularly
appropriate
--
and
tragic
--
that
the
land
that
produced
Karl
Marx
should
prove
socialism
's
failure
in
an
experiment
that
uses
its
own
people
as
controls
.

There
may
be
forces
that
would
delay
this
scenario
.

Ideologues
are
the
last
to
surrender
,
and
Germans
are
an
ideological
people
.

The
protesters
who
greeted
Mikhail
Gorbachev
at
East
Berlin
's
airport
earlier
this
month
were
n't
shouting
``
Go
U.S.A
''
--
they
were
chanting
``
Gorby
,
Help
Us
.

''
Ideologues
on
the
other
side
of
the
border
can
also
slow
the
process
.

Helmut
Kohl
's
governing
conservative
coalition
is
proving
admirably
true
to
the
West
German
constitution
by
making
more
than
500,000
people
of
German
descent
automatic
citizens
this
year
alone
.

But
within
the
government
and
in
the
think
tanks
outside
it
,
many
West
Germans
maintain
that
they
do
n't
want
immediate
reunification
.

Politically
,
this
currently
is
wisdom
--
particularly
given
a
nervous
neighboring
France
.

But
it
would
be
ironic
if
Germany
's
reunification
,
just
like
its
division
,
eventually
were
the
result
of
actions
in
centers
of
power
other
than
Bonn
and
Berlin
.

In
a
statement
that
was
as
close
as
East
Germany
gets
to
practicing
``
glasnost
''
,
Otto
Reinhold
,
an
East
German
party
theorist
,
actually
acknowledged
the
reunification
dilemma
.

``
The
main
problem
,
''
Mr.
Reinhold
said
in
an
East
German
radio
interview
monitored
by
Radio
Free
Europe
in
Munich
,
stems
from
the
fact
that
``
the
GDR
is
different
''
from
other
East
European
states
.

``
What
kind
of
right
to
exist
,
''
he
asked
,
``
would
a
capitalist
German
Democratic
Republic
have
alongside
a
capitalist
Federal
Republic
?
''
That
's
a
question
East
Germany
ca
n't
answer
easily
,
no
matter
what
its
new
leader
does
.

News
of
the
major
earthquake
in
California
Tuesday
triggered
a
round
of
dollar
sales
in
early
Asian
trade
,
but
most
foreign-exchange
dealers
said
they
expect
the
impact
of
the
quake
on
financial
markets
to
be
short-lived
.

Despite
the
dollar
's
lackluster
performance
,
some
foreign-exchange
traders
maintain
that

unit
remains
relatively
well
bid

Harris
Trust
's
Mr.
Woodland
noted
that

continues
to
show
resilience
in
the
face
of
a
barrage
of
``
headline
negatives
''
in

weeks
,
including
rate
increases
in

,
aggressive
central

intervention
,
a

,
an
unexpectedly
poor
U.S.

and
action
by

does

predict

significant
climb
for

unit

of
recent
moves

interest
rates
around

noted
that
``

potential
is
surprisingly

``
impressively

limited

Since
Friday
's
dive
in

market
prices
,
the

has
injected
reserves

system

an
effort
to
calm
the

avert
a
repeat
of

's

earthquake
,
it
's
hard
to
gauge
where
the

wants
the
key

funds
rate
.

They
say
that
the
earthquake
,
by
preventing
many
banks
from
operating
at
full
capacity
,
has
given
the
Fed
an
additional
reason
to
keep
liquidity
at
a
high
level

should
tend
to
reduce
the
federal
funds
rate
.

For
now
,
traders
say
the
foreign
exchange
market
is
scrutinizing
both
federal
funds
and
events
on
Wall
Street
.

They
note
that
the
dollar
remains
extremely
vulnerable
to
the
slightest
bad
news
from
the
stock
exchange
.

Indeed
,
the
U.S.
unit
edged
lower
as
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
dropped
about
13
points
in
early
trading
.

A
slight
recovery
in
the
stock
market
gave
currency
traders
confidence
to
push
the
dollar
higher
before
the
unit
dropped
back
by
day
's
end
.

Some
dealers
noted
that
nervousness
over
the
recent
sharp
dive
in
stock
prices
could
intensify
following
suggestions
by
Bank
of
Japan
Governor
Satoshi
Sumita
that
appeared
to
advise
Japanese
investors
to
be
very
careful
in
investing
in
U.S.
leveraged
buy-outs
.

Dealers
suggest
that
the
only
positive
news
on
the
horizon
that
could
detract
attention
from
equities
transactions
is
September
's
U.S.
consumer
price
data
.

The
figures
,
due
for
release
Friday
,
are
expected
to
show
an
uptick
in
inflation
to
4.8
%
from
4.7
%
in
August
.

If
the
figures
show
a
hefty
rise
in
inflation
,
they
could
militate
against
easing
by
the
Fed
.

On
the
Commodity
Exchange
in
New
York
,
gold
for
current

rose
$
1.30
to
$
368.70
an
ounce
in
moderate
trading
.

Estimated
volume
was
three
million

.

In

Hong
Kong
Thursday
,
gold
was
at
$
368.15

Crude
prices
spurted
upward
in
brisk
trading
on
the
assumption
that
heavy
earthquake
damage
occurred
to
San
Francisco
area
refinery
complexes
,
but
the
rise
quickly
fizzled
when
it
became
apparent
that
oil
operations
were
n't
severely
curtailed
.

Trading
on
little
specific
information
,
market
players
overnight
in
Tokyo
began
bidding
up
oil
prices
.

The
rally
spread
into
European
markets
,
where
traders
were
still
betting
that
the
earthquake
disrupted
the
San
Francisco
area
's
large
oil
refining
plants
.

By
yesterday
morning
,
much
of
the
world
was
still
unable
to
reach
San
Francisco
by
telephone
.

West
Texas
Intermediate
was
bid
up
more
than
20
cents
a
barrel
in
many
overseas
markets
.

At
the
opening
of
the
New
York
Mercantile
Exchange
,
West
Texas
Intermediate
for
November
delivery
shot
up
10
cents
a
barrel
,
to
$
20.85
,
still
on
the
belief
that
the
refineries
were
damaged
.

In
the
San
Francisco
area
,
roughly
800,000
barrels
a
day
of
crude
,
about
a
third
of
all
the
refining
capacity
in
California
,
is
processed
daily
,
according
to
industry
data
.

For
more
than
the
past
year
,
even
the
rumor
of
a
major
West
Coast
refinery
shutdown
has
been
enough
to
spark
a
futures
rally
because
the
gasoline
market
is
so
tight
.

But
yesterday
,
as
the
morning
wore
on
,
some
major
West
Coast
refinery
operators
--
including
Chevron
Corp.
,
Exxon
Corp.
and
the
Shell
Oil
Co.
unit
of
Royal
Group
--
said
their
refineries
were
n't
damaged
and
were
continuing
to
operate
normally
.

Most
said
they
shut
down
their
petroleum
pipeline
operations
as
a
precaution
but
did
n't
see
any
immediate
damage
.

Gasoline
terminals
were
also
largely
unhurt
,
they
said
.

``
It
's
hard
to
imagine
how
the
markets
were
speculating
,
given
that
nobody
could
get
through
to
San
Francisco
,
''
said
one
amazed
oil
company
executive
.

As
the
news
spread
that
the
refineries
were
intact
,
crude
prices
plunged
,
ending
the
day
at
$
20.56
a
barrel
,
down
19
cents
.

Gasoline
for
November
delivery
was
off
1.26
cents
a
gallon
to
54.58
cents
.

Heating
oil
finished
at
60.6
cents
,
down
0.45
cent
.

``
The
market
was
basically
acting
on
two
contradictory
forces
,
''
said
Nauman
Barakat
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
One
is
the
panic
,
the
earthquake
in
San
Francisco
,
which
is
positive
.

''
But
once
that
factor
was
eliminated
,
traders
took
profits
and
focused
on
crude
oil
inventories
,
Mr.
Barakat
said
.

After
the
market
closed
Tuesday
,
the
American
Petroleum
Institute
had
reported
that
crude
stocks
increased
by
5.7
million
barrels
in
the
week
ended
Friday
,
which
traders
viewed
as
bearish
.

But
some
market
players
still
think
earthquake
speculation
could
have
more
impact
on
the
oil
markets
.

``
The
problem
is
that
while
on
the
surface
everything
is
all
right
,
the
question
is
,
''
said
Mr.
Barakat
,
``
was
there
any
structural
damage
to
the
pipelines
or
anything
else
.

''
In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
:
COPPER
:
Futures
prices
eased
on
indications
of
improvement
in
the
industry
's
labor
situation
.

The
December
contract
declined
1.85
cents
a
pound
to
$
1.2645
.

According
to
one
analyst
,
workers
at
the
Cananea
copper
mine
in
Mexico
,
which
has
n't
been
operating
since
it
was
declared
bankrupt
by
the
Mexican
government
in
late
August
,
are
set
to
return
to
work
.

The
analyst
said
it
will
take
about
two
to
three
months
before
the
mine
begins
to
produce
copper
in
significant
quantities
.

He
added
that
,
while
there
has
n't
been
any
official
announcement
as
yet
,
the
Highland
Valley
mine
strike
in
British
Columbia
,
which
has
lasted
more
than
three
months
,
is
regarded
as
settled
.

Another
analyst
said
the
Cananea
return
to
operation
may
not
be
as
near
as
some
expect
.

``
There
are
still
negotiations
taking
place
on
whether
there
will
be
a
loss
of
jobs
,
which
has
been
a
critical
issue
all
along
,
''
he
said
.

Nevertheless
,
the
increasing
likelihood
that
these
two
major
supply
disruptions
will
be
resolved
weighed
on
the
market
,
the
analysts
agreed
.

Both
of
these
mines
are
normally
major
suppliers
of
copper
to
Japan
,
which
has
been
buying
copper
on
the
world
market
.

The
first
analyst
said
that
the
Japanese
,
as
well
as
the
Chinese
,
bought
copper
earlier
in
the
week
in
London
,
but
that
this
purchasing
has
since
slackened
as
the
supply
situation
,
at
least
over
the
long
term
,
appears
to
have
improved
.

``
The
focus
for
some
time
has
been
on
the
copper
supply
,
and
good
demand
has
been
taken
for
granted
,
''
he
said
.

``
Now
that
the
supply
situation
seems
to
be
improving
,
it
would
be
best
for
traders
to
switch
their
concentration
to
the
demand
side
.

''
He
noted
the
Commerce
Department
report
yesterday
that
housing
starts
in
September
dropped
5.2
%
from
August
to
1.26
million
units
on
an
annualized
basis
,
the
lowest
level
in
seven
years
.

``
Along
with
these
factors
,
other
economic
reports
suggest
a
slowing
of
the
economy
,
which
could
mean
reduced
copper
usage
,
''
he
said
.

SUGAR
:
Futures
prices
extended
Tuesday
's
gains
.

The
March
delivery
ended
with
an
advance
of
0.16
cent
a
pound
to
14.27
cents
,
for
a
two-day
gain
of
0.3
cent
.

According
to
one
dealer
,
Japan
said
it
has
only
40,000
tons
of
sugar
remaining
to
be
shipped
to
it
this
year
by
Cuba
under
current
commitments
.

The
announcement
was
made
because
of
reports
Tuesday
that
Cuba
would
delay
shipments
to
Japan
scheduled
for
later
this
year
,
into
early
next
year
.

The
dealer
said
the
quantity
mentioned
in
the
Japanese
announcement
is
so
small
that
it
's
meaningless
.

One
analyst
said
he
thought
the
market
continued
to
be
supported
to
some
degree
by
a
delay
in
the
Cuban
sugar
harvest
caused
by
adverse
weather
.

The
dealer
said
India
might
be
the
real
factor
that
is
keeping
futures
prices
firm
.

That
country
recently
bought
200,000
tons
of
sugar
and
had
been
expected
to
seek
a
like
quantity
last
week
but
did
n't
.

``
It
's
known
they
need
the
sugar
,
and
the
expectation
that
they
will
come
in
is
apparently
giving
the
market
its
principal
support
,
''
the
dealer
said
.

LIVESTOCK
AND
MEATS
:
The
Agriculture
Department
is
expected
to
announce
tomorrow
that
the
number
of
cattle
in
the
13
major
ranch
states
slipped
4
%
to
8.21
million
on
Oct.
1
compared
with
the
level
a
year
earlier
,
said
Tom
Morgan
,
president
of
Sterling
Research
Corp.
,
Arlington
Heights
,
Ill
.

Cattle
prices
have
risen
in
recent
weeks
on
speculation
that
the
government
's
quarterly
report
will
signal
tighter
supplies
of
beef
.

Among
other
things
,
the
government
is
expected
to
report
that
the
number
of
young
cattle
placed
on
feedlots
during
the
quarter
slipped
3
%
.

Feedlots
fatten
cattle
for
slaughter
,
so
a
drop
indicates
that
the
production
of
beef
will
dip
this
winter
.

Indeed
,
some
analysts
expect
the
government
to
report
that
the
movement
of
young
cattle
onto
feedlots
in
the
month
of
September
in
seven
big
ranch
states
dropped
8
%
compared
with
the
level
for
September
1988

A
new
drug
to
prevent
the
rejection
of
transplanted
organs
has
been
successfully
used
on
more
than
100
patients
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
,
according
to
researchers
.

The
drug
,
which
is
still
in
the
experimental
phase
,
has
n't
been
approved
yet
by
the
Food
and
Drug
Admistration
,
and
its
long-term
effects
are
unknown
.

But
researchers
say
the
drug
,
called
FK-506
,
could
revolutionize
the
transplantation
field
by
reducing
harmful
side
effects
and
by
lowering
rejection
rates
.

Rejection
has
been
the
major
obstacle
in
the
approximately
30,000
organ
transplants
performed
world-wide
each
year
.

Researchers
began
using
the
drug
in
February
on
patients
who
had
received
kidney
,
liver
,
heart
and
pancreas
transplants
.

Only
two
of
111
transplants
have
been
rejected
.

The
drug
,
discovered
in
1984
,
is
metabolized
from
soil
fungus
found
in
Japan
.

The
Pittsburgh
patients
are
the
first
humans
to
be
given
the
drug
,
which
is
made
by
Fujisawa
Pharmaceutical
Co
.

``
We
're
shocked
by
it
,
because
it
's
worked
so
fast
,
''
said
Dr.
Thomas
E.
Starzl
,
director
of
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
Transplantation
Program
,
at
a
news
conference
here
yesterday
.

``
We
consider
it
a
life-saving
drug
,
like
one
for
AIDS
,
''
said
Dr.
John
Fung
,
an
immunologist
at
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
.

Researchers
say
they
believe
FK-506
is
100
times
more
effective
than
the
traditional
anti-rejection
drug
,
cyclosporine
,
made
by
Swiss
pharmaceutical
giant
Sandoz
Ltd
.

They
are
also
encouraged
by
the
relatively
mild
side
effects
of
FK-506
,
compared
with
cyclosporine
,
which
can
cause
renal
failure
,
morbidity
,
nausea
and
other
problems
.

``
The
side
effects
{
of
cyclosporine
}
have
made
the
penalty
for
its
success
rather
high
,
''
Dr.
Starzl
said
.

Dr.
Fung
said
that
FK-506
would
not
be
available
in
the
market
for
at
least
a
year
,
and
that
the
FDA
approval
process
usually
takes
three
years
to
five
years
.

There
are
no
firm
plans
to
expand
the
experimental
program
beyond
the
University
of
Pittsburgh
,
whose
hospital
performs
the
most
transplants
in
the
world
.

Researchers
could
n't
estimate
the
cost
of
the
drug
when
it
reaches
the
market
,
but
they
said
FK-506
will
enable
patients
to
cut
hospital
stays
by
50
%
and
reduce
the
number
of
blood
tests
used
to
monitor
the
dosage
of
cyclosporine
and
other
drugs
among
transplant
recipients
.

Dr.
Starzl
said
the
research
has
been
largely
financed
by
the
National
Institute
of
Health
and
by
university
funds
,
and
that
Fujisawa
did
n't
give
the
hospital
any
grants
.

He
said
that
the
research
team
had
no
financial
stake
in
the
drug
.

``
We
've
known
for
six
months
the
effect
of
this
drug
,
and
our
advice
to
our
people
has
been
not
to
buy
the
company
's
stock
,
''
Dr.
Starzl
said
,
adding
that
profiting
from
FK-506
would
n't
be
ethical
.

Economist
David
N.
Laband
's
Sept.
27
editorial-page
article
,
``
In
Hugo
's
Path
,
a
Man-Made
Disaster
,
''
decries
the
control
of
price
gouging
,
swiftly
ordered
by
South
Carolina
's
governor
after
Hurricane
Hugo
.

According
to
Mr.
Laband
,
``
screaming
''
for
price
controls
occurs
when
income
redistribution
``
threatens
to
hit
home
.

''
To
be
sure
,
the
threat
has
hit
home
down
here
.

Yet
in
Mr.
Laband
's
rehash
of
free-market
logic
,
human
greed
and
self-interest
are
the
only
permissible
psychological
reactions
.

Allowing
uncontrolled
prices
for
necessities
would
indeed
shorten
the
lines
at
stores
,
as
he
contends
.

But
not
because
resources
are
going
to
their
most
efficient
use
,
leaving
scarce
goods
``
allocated
to
those
buyers
who
place
the
highest
value
on
them
.

''
Rather
,
lines
would
diminish
because
at
higher
prices
many
victims
could
not
afford
necessities
such
as
food
and
medical
supplies
.

It
is
inhumane
to
imply
that
a
poor
,
unemployed
woman
can
not
receive
immediate
relief
for
her
family
at
fair
prices
because
she
does
not
have
as
much
to
protect
as
a
rich
family
.

Moreover
,
essential
relief
supplies
such
as
ice
must
be
distributed
throughout
the
population
because
of
potential
health
problems
from
spoiled
food
and
possible
outbreak
of
disease
.

Such
spillover
effects
give
the
state
a
right
to
intervene
in
the
marketplace
and
temporarily
coordinate
allocation
of
resources
.

Fortunately
,
volunteers
and
charities
are
not
motivated
by
self-interest
,
but
by
altruism
.

Why
should
they
have
to
co-exist
with
opportunists
rushing
in
to
turn
a
quick
profit
?
These
latter-day
scalawags
would
be
ill-advised
to
take
advantage
of
the
situation
,
if
they
ever
expect
to
face
the
people
of
South
Carolina
again
.

The
government
is
actually
protecting
avaricious
ice-baggers
and
other
profiteers
who
can
not
see
beyond
their
own
short-term
gain
.

South
Carolina
deserves
an
A
for
its
quick
and
timely
relief
efforts
.

Mr.
Laband
,
meanwhile
,
gets
an
A
for
his
rote
recital
of
economic-efficiency
arguments
.

Give
him
an
F
for
his
failure
to
understand
the
ethics
of
economic
equity

Mr.
Laband

us
an
idea
why
economists

predictions
are
usually
wrong
.

They
set
up
absurd
situations
,
detached
from
reality
,
and
then
try
to
reason
from
them
.

I
'm
surprised
he
did
n't
advocate
letting
people
loot
,
since
that
behavior
can
also
be
foreseen
in
a
disaster
and
``
every
individual
has
an
incentive
to
alter
the
distribution
of
income
in
his
favor
.

''
Price
controls
were
``
so
fervently

face
when
dealing
with
disasters
such
as
Hugo
--
anti-profiteering
ordinances
such
as
that
by
the
Charleston
City
Council
as
it
thrashed
about
trying
to
Do
Something
.

Since
he
concentrated
on
the
economic
folly
of
such
ordinances
,
he
did
n't
mention
certain
other
of
their
effects
.

They
divert
law-enforcement
resources
at
a
time
they
are
most
needed
for
protecting
lives
and
property
.

Also
,
rather
than
increase
supplies
,
they
reduce
them
and
encourage
hoarding
.

And
they
,
or
even
the
prospect
of
them
,
discourage
disaster
preparedness
in
the
form
of
speculative
advance
stocking
of
supplies
by
merchants
.

Would
Mr.
Laband
also
suggest
that
the
Red
Cross
,
Salvation
Army
,
military
units
,
police
,
fire
departments
,
rescue
units
and
individual
citizens
cease
their
efforts
to
assist
Hugo
's
victims
because
they
interfere
with
his
concept
of
the
``
free
market
''
?
What
about
those
caring
people
all
over
the
country
who
are
donating
food
,
water
and
other
necessities
of
life
to
these
people
who
could
be
any
of
us
?
Should
they
,
too
,
stop
``
messing
with
''
his
free
market
?
Maybe
he
thinks
they
should
also
sell
to
the
highest
bidder
.

And
what
about
insurance
firms
?
Should
they
be
required
to
pay
claims
based
on
exorbitant
costs
for
labor
and
materials
?
Mr.
Laband
should
beware
,
since
he
lives
in
South
Carolina
.

In
a
free
market
,
his
insurance
rates
can
be
raised
to
recover
insurance-company
losses
.

Having
been
through
several
tornadoes
and
hurricanes
,
I
have
a
different
perspective
.

Mine
comes
from
seeing
thriving
communities
devastated
--
but
only
temporarily
.

Their
recovery
came
surprisingly
fast
,
and
always
with
the
help
of
neighbors
.

The
shock
of
seeing
homes
destroyed
and
city
services
disrupted
may
cause
some
to
confuse
priorities
such
as
the
true
economic
value
of
a
freezer
full
of
meat
.

In
Texas
after
Hurricane
Alicia
,
major
grocery
chains
used
their
truck
fleets
to
ship
essential
goods
to
Houston
,
no
gouging
,
just
good
will
.

Tom
Mongan
Victoria
,
Texas
We
here
in
the
affected
areas
were
dazzled
by
Mr.
Laband
's
analysis
of
time
values
and
his
comparisons
of
effectiveness
concerning
research
and
development
.

His
theoretical
approach
and
its
publication
in
this
venerable
paper
are
no
doubt
a
noteworthy
accomplishment
for
him
.

Too
bad
theory
fails
in
practice
.

We
consumers
tend
to
have
long
memories
.

The
businesses
subscribing
to
Mr.
Laband
's
effective
price
system
will
be
remembered
when
normalcy
returns
.

Perhaps
,
considering
the
value
of
our
time
,
we
will
be
unable
to
patronize
their
establishments
in
the
post-Hugo
era
.

I
have
a
question
for
Mr.
Laband
:
How
do
I
explain
to
the
single
mother
of
three
standing
in
line
next
to
me
for
the
past
three
hours
that
the
two
bags
of
ice
she
needs
to
keep
her
children
's
food
edible
will
take
her
last
$
20
?
I
'm
sure
she
'll
appreciate
what
an
efficient
reaction
to
her
problems
the
price
system
has
created

This
seems
to
be
the
season
for
revivals
in
Chicago
.

Though
the
Cubs
'
championship
season
ended
with
the
National
League
playoffs
,
a
revival
of
the
Organic
Theater
's
production
of
``
Bleacher
Bums
,
''
a
play
in
nine
innings
set
in
the
Wrigley
Field
bleachers
,
continues
within
spitting
distance
of
the
ballpark
.

Revivals
of
a
different
sort
also
are
being
offered
by
our
two
major
theater
troupes
,
the
Goodman
and
Steppenwolf
.

Each
is
more
problematic
than
an
unexpected
divisional
baseball
championship
,
but
both
help
explain
why
Chicago
remains
a
vital
center
of
this
country
's
regional
theater
movement
.

The
Goodman
is
offering
a
modernized
version
of
Moliere
's
``
The
Misanthrope
''
through
Nov.
4
.

The
original
is
a
comedy
about
Alceste
,
a
man
who
sees
falseness
and
vanity
in
everyone
except
himself
.

He
is
the
jealous
friend
of
Philinte
,
and
the
jealous
lover
of
Celimene
.

The
play
is
filled
with
intrigue
,
dishonesty
and
injustice
.

Twenty-five
years
ago
the
poet
Richard
Wilbur
modernized
this
17th-century
comedy
merely
by
avoiding
``
the
zounds
sort
of
thing
,
''
as
he
wrote
in
his
introduction
.

Otherwise
,
the
scene
remained
Celimene
's
house
in
1666
.

Assuming
modern
audiences
readily
understand
that
Moliere
's
social
indictment
covers
their
world
as
well
as
17th-century
Paris
,
Mr.
Wilbur
concentrated
his
formidable
artistry
on
rendering
the
Alexandrine
French
verse
into
sprightly
and
theatrical
English
iambic
pentameter
.

The
Wilbur
translation
is
remarkable
--
well
worth
a
read
and
even
better
seen
in
the
theater
if
you
ever
have
the
opportunity
.

But
if
you
happen
to
be
coming
to
Chicago
in
the
next
few
weeks
,
do
n't
fail
to
have
a
look
at
Robert
Falls
's
``
The
Misanthrope
''
at
the
Goodman
.

If
Mr.
Wilbur
's
translation
is
a
finely
ground
lens
through
which
we
see
the
pettiness
and
corruption
of
17th-century
Paris
,
Mr.
Falls
's
production
is
a
mirror
in
which
we
see
ourselves
.

Mr.
Falls
,
the
Goodman
's
artistic
director
,
took
a
recent
adaptation
by
Neil
Bartlett
and
significantly
adapted
it
.

Mr.
Bartlett
had
slimmed
Moliere
's
cast
of
characters
to
six
and
set
them
in
the
London
media
world
of
Thatcherite
Britain
.

Mr.
Falls
transfers
the
setting
to
Hollywood
,
and
transforms
the
characters
into
what
passes
for
aristocracy
there
--
agents
,
producers
,
actors
,
writers
and
sycophants
.

It
works
.

Mr.
Bartlett
managed
to
more
or
less
maintain
Moliere
's
Alexandrine
verse
form
,
12
syllable
lines
in
rhyming
couplets
.

Mr.
Falls
kept
the
form
,
but
Americanized
it
with
Mr.
Bartlett
's
further
help
.

With
a
splendid
cast
led
by
David
Darlow
as
Alceste
,
Christina
Haag
as
Celimene
and
,
especially
,
William
Brown
as
a
Philinte
who
plays
the
Hollywood
game
but
harbors
authentic
values
and
feelings
,
the
Goodman
production
barrels
through
an
all-night
Hollywood
party
with
exuberance
and
wit
.

If
this
version
,
with
its
references
to
Steven
Spielberg
,
Spago
and
``
thirtysomething
''
attracts
younger
audiences
who
might
stay
away
from
the
classical
version
,
then
Messrs.
Bartlett
and
Falls
are
justified
in
abandoning
Mr.
Wilbur
.

A
300-year-old
play
may
be
easier
to
revive
than
one
merely
25
.

The
Steppenwolf
Theatre
Company
,
back
from
a
critical
and
box
office
success
in
London
with
its
adaptation
of
Steinbeck
's
``
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
,
''
opened
the
new
season
with
Harold
Pinter
's
``
The
Homecoming
,
''
first
produced
by
the
Royal
Shakespeare
Company
in
1965
.

Back
then
,
Mr.
Pinter
was
not
only
the
angry
young
British
playwright
,
but
also
the
first
to
use
silences
and
sentence
fragments
and
menacing
stares
,
almost
to
the
exclusion
of
what
we
previously
understood
to
be
theatrical
dialogue
.

When
``
The
Homecoming
''
was
first
produced
on
this
side
of
the
Atlantic
,
actors
and
directors
were
reverential
.

Silences
were
lengthy
--
nobody
moved
or
gestured
.

Nobody
smiled
onstage
,
and
nobody
in
the
audience
was
encouraged
to
laugh
.

This
kind
of
theater
was
new
to
us
.

Also
,
it
was
not
a
funny
time
over
here
,
what
with
the
Vietnam
War
,
the
'68
Democratic
convention
,
assassinations
and
riots
.

But
under
Jerry
Perry
's
direction
the
current
Steppenwolf
production
,
scheduled
to
play
through
Nov.
19
,
breaks
through
the
flat
and
boring
ritual
that
``
The
Homecoming
''
had
become
.

Led
by
a
near-perfect
performance
by
Alan
Wilder
as
Max
,
the
father
,
the
play
is
at
once
an
appalling
and
hilarious
dissection
of
a
family
's
rage
,
bitterness
,
fear
and
isolation
.

Encouraged
by
Mr.
Wilder
's
sly
grins
,
embarrassed
grimaces
and
sputtering
rages
,
the
audience
gets
the
joke
and
begins
to
laugh
before
the
end
of
the
first
act
.

Three
of
the
family
members
,
Max
and
his
two
sons
,
Lenny
and
Joey
,
live
off
the
flesh
:
Max
is
a
retired
butcher
,
Lenny
a
pimp
and
Joey
an
aspiring
boxer
.

Sam
,
Max
's
brother
,
has
escaped
the
flesh
by
working
as
a
liveried
chauffeur
and
never
seeking
a
wife
.

Teddy
,
the
eldest
of
Max
's
sons
,
has
made
the
most
dramatic
escape
by
becoming
a
professor
of
philosophy
at
an
American
university
.

Though
it
's
clearly
Max
's
wife
who
held
sway
here
until
her
death
,
now
none
of
the
other
male
residents
of
this
misbegotten
household
can
challenge
Max
.

The
play
concerns
Teddy
's
homecoming
with
his
wife
of
six
years
,
Ruth
.

Curiously
,
Randall
Arney
as
Teddy
seems
the
only
cast
member
unable
to
get
beyond
the
zombie
approach
to
a
Pinter
character
.

As
Ruth
,
Moira
Harris
,
a
large
and
beautiful
woman
who
may
be
our
next
Colleen
Dewhurst
,
begins
almost
immediately
to
overpower
each
of
the
men
.

In
the
end
,
Teddy
returns
alone
to
America
,
leaving
Ruth
in
Max
's
chair
.

We
have
seen
her
develop
within
a
few
hours
from
a
shy
and
unknown
in-law
to
a
goddess
of
the
flesh
who
will
replace
the
dead
mother
,
and
then
some
.

While
Steppenwolf
was
in
London
with
``
The
Grapes
of
Wrath
,
''
Bruce
Sagan
,
the
president
of
its
board
of
directors
,
quietly
returned
to
Chicago
to
buy
a
piece
of
real
estate
in
the
city
's
rapidly
reviving
North
Halsted
Street
restaurant
and
theater
district
.

Within
a
year
he
hopes
Steppenwolf
will
move
into
a
new
500-seat
theater
on
that
site
.

The
troupe
currently
performs
in
a
converted
dairy
that
seats
211
and
provides
little
capacity
for
staging
anything
beyond
a
simple
one-set
production
.

``
If
we
wanted
to
stage
`
Death
of
a
Salesman
,
'
``
Mr.
Sagan
says
,
``
Willie
Loman
would
have
to
live
in
a
ranch
house
because
of
the
low
ceiling
.

''
Steppenwolf
needs
the
extra
seats
even
more
than
the
fly
space
.

It
's
currently
forced
to
turn
away
many
potential
subscribers
beyond
the
13,000
who
can
be
accommodated
in
its
present
digs
.

For
all
the
attention
that
Chicago
theater
has
received
during
the
past
decade
,
not
one
new
building
has
been
devoted
to
it
.

Mr.
Sagan
,
a
former
publisher
and
real
estate
developer
,
has
put
together
an
$
8
million
financial
package
that
includes
approximately
$
4
million
of
tax
exempt
bonds
issued
by
the
State
of
Illinois
(
the
first
time
that
a
state
has
used
its
educational
facilities
authority
to
support
construction
of
a
theater
)
,
and
approximately
$
1
million
in
grants
from
the
National
Endowment
for
the
Arts
,
the
MacArthur
Foundation
,
and
a
few
other
deep
pockets
.

The
rest
,
he
is
confident
,
can
be
raised
.

His
board
members
alone
have
pledged
$
800,000
and
he
is
just
beginning
to
massage
local
foundations
and
corporations
.

Mr.
Sagan
compares
the
importance
of
Steppenwolf
with
Orson
Welles
's
Mercury
Theater
in
the
'30s
.

But
Welles
's
theater
company
turned
out
to
have
a
brief
--
one
might
say
a
mercurial
--
existence
.

What
will
Mr.
Sagan
do
with
his
new
theater
building
if
the
allure
of
Hollywood
and
Broadway
proves
too
much
for
such
Steppenwolf
stalwarts
as
John
Malkovich
(
``
Dangerous
Liaisons
''
)
,
Joan
Allen
(
``
The
Heidi
Chronicles
''
)
,
and
Glenne
Headly
(
``
Lonesome
Dove
''
)
,
and
the
company
crumbles
?
``
That
's
OK
,
''
Mr.
Sagan
replies
.

``
Let
this
building
be
Steppenwolf
's
legacy
to
Chicago
theater
.

After
enduring
three
days
of
heavy
selling
,
the
beleaguered
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
finally
rebounded
,
rising
sharply

hearty
trading
.

The
Nasdaq

jumped
0.7

,
said
the
OTC
market
has
a
habit
of
lagging
big
moves
on
the
New

Stock

.

While
the
industrial
average
rallied
on
Monday
following
last
Friday
's
collapse
,
the
OTC
market
,
which
did
n't
suffer
too
badly
during
the
correction
,
tumbled
.

``
Our
market
got
hit
a
lot
harder
on
Monday
than
the
listed
market
,
''
Mr.
Bruno
said
.

``
We
're
just
recovering
and
getting
back
to
business
as
usual
.

I
'm
encouraged
by
the
action
.

''
The
trading
pace
was
busy
,
with
4,343
issues
and
147.6
million
shares
changing
hands
.

Advancing
issues
beat
declining
ones
,
1,271
to
811
.

Much
of
the
jockeying
by
OTC
traders
and
investors
centered
on
shares
of
companies
that
might
be
financially
affected
by
damage
from
the
devastating
earthquake
in
northern
California
.

As
investors
speculated
about
the
long
-
and
short-term
implications
,
shares
of
a
number
of
companies
that
might
either
profit
or
face
problems
because
of
the
disaster
were
actively
traded
.

Heading
the
list
:
insurance
,
construction
and
technology
companies
located
in
the
San
Francisco
Bay
Area
.

Insurance-related
stocks
were
mixed
as
investors
tried
to
figure
out
how
to
assess
the
impact
of
the
property
damage
and
deaths
on
those
concerns
.

Traders
said
property-casualty
companies
with
the
heaviest
exposure
in
the
San
Francisco
area
include
the
OTC
's
Safeco
and
Ohio
Casualty
.

Frank
Gilmartin
,
a
trader
who
follows
insurance
stocks
for
Fox-Pitt
Kelton
,
said
his
strategy
was
to
sell
early
.

Then
,
if
the
stocks
fell
sharply
,
he
planned
to
begin
buying
them
aggressively
,
on
the
theory
that
the
companies
that
insure
against
property
damage
and
accidents
will
have
to
raise
rates
eventually
to
compensate
for
the
claims
they
will
pay
to
earthquake
victims
and
victims
of
last
month
's
Hurricane
Hugo
.

As
well
,
reinsurers
and
insurance
brokerage
companies
will
have
improved
profits
.

Many
investors
expected
damage
from
the
hurricane
to
be
the
catalyst
for
higher
rates
in
the
industry
,
which
has
been
depressed
because
of
low
rates
arising
from
intense
competition
.

But
Mr.
Gilmartin
said
the
hurricane
damage
was
n't
extensive
enough
to
prompt
premium
boosts
.

``
The
companies
just
gave
back
what
they
had
reserved
for
,
''
he
said
.

``
Now
,
they
'll
have
to
increase
their
coffers
to
protect
for
the
future
and
that
means
rate
increases
.

''
Overall
OTC
insurance
issues
were
mixed
.

Safeco
fell
to
32
on
462,900
shares
.

Ohio
Casualty
rose
to
51
on
137,200

to

million
Canadian
dollars
(
US$

the

,
which
was
due
to
expire
Monday
,
may
still
be
extended
or
varied
.

Institut
Merieux
's
bid
for
Toronto-based
Connaught
has
run
into
problems
with
the
Canadian
government
,
which
told
Merieux
last
week
that
it
was
n't
convinced
that
the
proposed
acquisition
would
be
of
``
net
benefit
''
to
Canada
.

Merieux
officials
are
expected
to
meet
with
federal
officials
in
Ottawa
today
to
discuss
the
decision
.

Within
minutes
after
the
stock
market
closed
Friday
,
I
called
Sen.
Bill
Bradley
of
New
Jersey
,
advised
him
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
had
declined
by
190
points
late
that
afternoon
,
and
cheerfully
informed
him
that
he
and
his
fellow
Democrats
were
to
blame
.

They
had
dealt
a
major
setback
that
afternoon
to
President
Bush
's
capital-gains
tax
cut
proposal
,
which
had
seemed
in
the
bag
after
it
passed
the
House
overwhelmingly
earlier
in
the
month
.

Sen.
Bradley
has
it
in
his
mind
that
such
a
tax
cut
would
unravel
the
tax
reform
he
helped
engineer
in
1986
.

But
he
knows
that
as
many
as
20
of
his
fellow
Democrats
are
disposed
to
vote
for
the
cut
,
popular
among
their
constituents
.

As
a
result
,
he
took
the
lead
in
arguing
that
the
cut
should
be
blocked
on
procedural
grounds
.

He
helped
persuade
10
of
these
senators
to
support
him
and
Majority
Leader
George
Mitchell
on
these
grounds
.

The
budget
reconciliation
had
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
Oct.
15
deadline
,
and
these
Senate
Democrats
refused
to
agree
to
allow
a
vote
to
append
capital
gains
to
the
budget
bill
,
knowing
it
would
pass
.

Denied
a
vote
on
substance
,
the
GOP
leadership
in
the
Senate
on
Friday
morning
was
confronted
with
a
hard
choice
.

It
could
throw
in
the
towel
and
hope
to
win
on
capital
gains
late
this
month
,
or
it
could
follow
the
White
House
strategy
,
to
veto
reconciliation
unless
capital
gains
was
appended
.

The
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
has
been
in
the
forefront
in
supporting
the
Bush
proposal
.

It
endorsed
the
White
House
strategy
,
believing
it
to
be
the
surest
way
to
victory
.

At
noon
Friday
,
a
senior
White
House
official
advised
Richard
Rahn
,
the
Chamber
's
chief
economist
,
that
the
White
House
would
not
agree
to
a
budget
reconciliation
bill
unless
it
had
firm
assurances
that
a
vote
on
substance
would
be
permitted
in
the
Senate
.

Two
hours
later
,
the
first
word
emerged
on
Capitol
Hill
that
the
administration
had
agreed
to
reconciliation
with
no
such
assurances
from
Senate
Democrats
.

Mr.
Rahn
was
shocked
,
telephoning
the
office
of
Richard
Darman
,
director
of
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
,
and
the
administration
's
chief
strategist
on
this
issue
.

He
left
a
message
accusing
Mr.
Darman
of
selling
out
.

It
was
the
Senate
Republicans
,
though
,
who
had
edged
away
from
the
veto
strategy
.

The
stock
market
reacted
as
Mr.
Rahn
did
,
crumbling
as
it
absorbed
the
news
that
Mr.
Darman
's
strategy
had
been
abandoned
.

The
stock
market
,
after
all
,
represents
the
collective
expectations
about
the
value
of
the
future
income
stream
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
,
discounted
to
present
value
.

Why
should
it
be
so
surprising
that
a
30
%
cut
in
the
capital-gains
tax
would
have
such
an
enormous
impact
on
the
value
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
?
The
total
value
of
privately
held
assets
is
easily
more
than
$
15
trillion
.

The
value
traded
on
the
exchanges
is
close
to
$
3
trillion
.

If
the
tax
on
any
gain
to
those
assets
was
doubled
,
would
n't
the
value
fall
to
the
owners
of
the
assets
?
Is
n't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
asset
you
own
would
be
worth
more
if
the
government
suddenly
announced
that
if
you
sold
it
,
you
would
be
able
to
keep
30
%
more
of
its
gain
than
you
previously
believed
?
Indeed
,
the
stock
market
's
steady
advance
this
year
tracked
with
President
Bush
's
success
in
advancing
his
capital-gains
proposal
.

A
30
%
cut
in
this
year
's
capital
gains
alone
amounts
to
roughly
$
50
billion
.

We
're
talking
real
money
.

When
Richard
Rahn
advised
the
financial
press
that
the
market
crash
was
caused
by
the
setback
to
capital
gains
,
he
was
generally
ignored
and
mildly
ridiculed
.

Instead
,
the
press
corps
readily
accepted
the
notion
that
a
snag
in
the
takeover
financing
of
United
Airlines
instantly
knocked
7
%
off
the
value
of
the
nation
's
capital
stock
and
caused
convulsions
around
the
world
.

Mr.
Rahn
was
pointing
out
an
elephant
rumbling
through
Wall
Street
while
conventional
wisdom
had
fastened
on
the
UAL
flea
.

Why
is
this
happening
?
For
one
thing
,
quite
a
number
of
the
leading
spokesmen
on
Wall
Street
are
not
portfolio
managers
,
who
understand
that
the
value
of
assets
is
greatly
affected
by
how
government
taxes
those
assets
.

They
are
economists
and
financial
reporters
who
sympathize
with
the
view
that
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
benefits
the
rich
.

Yet
they
somehow
think
that
Wall
Street
is
indifferent
to
losing
the
tax
cut
that
seemed
so
close
Friday
morning
and
is
now
problematic
.

The
market
rebound
Monday
followed
weekend
assurances
from
Mr.
Darman
that
the
administration
has
other
plans
to
win
the
cut
,
which
is
alive
and
well
.

Sen.
Bradley
's
argument
is
that
a
capital-gains
tax
cut
would
be
bad
for
the
economy
in
the
longer
run
.

It
would
inevitably
lead
to
an
increase
in
marginal
income-tax
rates
in
1990
,
he
thinks
,
when
the
White
House
is
forced
to
ask
for
higher
taxes
to
meet
budget
targets
.

That
is
,
with
capital
gains
cut
,
the
glue
of
the
1986
accord
will
be
gone
,
and
political
realities
will
push
up
income-tax
rates
.

The
counter-argument
,
which
he
has
heard
,
is
that
if
he
and
his
fellow
Democrats
are
successful
in
killing
the
president
's
proposal
,
the
revenue
gap
will
open
up
tremendously
in
1990
because
of
the
weakened
economy
.

In
this
atmosphere
,
there
would
be
no
serious
consideration
of
tax
increases
.

If
Sen.
Bradley
would
permit
a
vote
on
capital
gains
,
though
,
it
would
pass
,
Christmas
retail
sales
would
be
strong
instead
of
burdened
by
a
falling
stock
market
,
the
1990
economy
would
be
robust
,
and
the
revenue
gains
at
every
level
of
government
,
including
New
Jersey
's
,
would
be
surprisingly
high
.

No
tax
increases
would
be
necessary
.

The
struggle
over
capital
gains
is
the
most
important
game
in
town
.

In
Washington
and
on
Wall
Street
.

Mr.

Federal
prosecutors
said
they
have
obtained
a
guilty
plea
from
another
person
in
the
government
's
ongoing
probe
of
illegal
payments
in
the
record
industry
.

William
Craig
,
an
independent
record
promoter
,
pleaded
guilty
to
payola
and
criminal
tax
charges
,
according
to
a
statement
issued
by
Gary
Feess
,
the
U.S.
attorney
here
.

Payola
is
the
practice
of
making
illegal
,
undisclosed
payments
to
radio
station
personnel
in
return
for
getting
the
stations
to
play
certain
songs
over
the
air
.

As
part
of
his
plea
agreement
with
the
government
,
the
44-year-old
Mr.
Craig
faces
a
maximum
of
three
years
in
prison
.

In
return
,
Mr.
Craig
agreed
to
cooperate
in
the
government
's
continuing
payola
probe
,
says
a
spokeswoman
for
the
U.S.
attorney
's
office
.

Mr.
Craig
and
three
others
were
indicted
last
year
as
part
of
that
payola
probe
.

Two
other
defendants
previously
pleaded
guilty
,
and
charges
against
the
third
were
dropped
.

The
TVA
said
the
refinancing
should
save
$
75
million
a
year
in
interest
payments
.

The
refinancing
is
part
of
the
TVA
's
strategy
of
dealing
with
what
has
been
an
intractable
problem
:
its
staggering
$
18.5
billion
debt
,
most
of
which
is
owed
to
the
Treasury
Department
's
Federal
Financing
Bank
.

The
TVA
currently
plans
to
issue
a
total
of
$
6.7
billion
in
bonds
to
refinance
its
high-interest
debt
.

The
$
4
billion
bond
issue
also
will
help
the
TVA
meet
its
goal
of
not
raising
rates
for
another
year
,
said
William
F.
Malec
,
the
agency
's
chief
financial
officer
.

The
bond
issue
is
TVA
's
first
public
offering
since
the
Financing
Bank
was
created
in
1974
,
primarily
to
finance
the
TVA
.

But
the
offering
almost
did
n't
happen
.

The
TVA
,
in
fact
,
decided
to
proceed
with
the
bond
offering
following
an
agreement
last
week
with
the
Financing
Bank
,
which
allows
TVA
to
keep
borrowing
short
term
from
the
bank
for
two
years
after
it
goes
to
the
public
market
.

The
Treasury
contended
that
TVA
could
n't
borrow
from
both
it
and
the
public
debt
market
.

The
$
4
billion
in
bonds
break
down
as
follows
:
$
1
billion
in
five-year
bonds
with
a
coupon
rate
of
8.25
%
and
a
yield
to
maturity
of
8.33
%
;
$
1
billion
in
10-year
bonds
with
a
coupon
rate
of
8.375
%
and
a
yield
to
maturity
of
8.42
%
;
$
2

Mutual-fund
czar
John
M.
Templeton
has
put
his
money
where
his
moniker
is
,
pouring
$
1.4
million
into
one
of
his
own
funds
,
the
Templeton
Value
Fund
.

Mr.
Templeton
owns
shares
in
several
of
the

his

only
in

of

and
now
the
Value

Why
did

add

Because
he
's
very
bullish
on
the
emerging
growth

that
make
up

's

Mr.

In
one
of
the
first
indoor
air-pollution
cases
to
go
to
trial
,
a
state-court
jury
decided
in
favor
of
the
defendant
,
Burlington
Industries
Inc
.

The
verdict
,
reached
late
last
week
in
Cincinnati
,
may
end
an
eight-year
legal
battle
for
the
Greensboro
,
N.C.
,
carpet
maker
.

Glenn
and
Sharon
Beebe
of
Cincinnati
had
sued
the
com
-
pany
in
1981
after
installing
Burlington
carpets
in
their
office
.

The
Beebes
alleged
that
toxic
fumes
from
the
carpets
made
them
sick
.

As
a
result
of
their
illness
,
the
Beebes
said
,
they
lost
$
1.8
million
in
wages
and
earnings
.

In
addition
,
they
said
that
months
of
exposure
to
the
chemicals
has
left
them
sensitive
to
a
wide
range
of
commonly
used
substances
.

The
case
had
been
closely
watched
because
attorneys
anticipate
increasing
litigation
nationally
over
the
so-called
sick-building
syndrome
.

Plaintiffs
'
lawyers
say
that
buildings
become
``
sick
''
when
inadequate
fresh
air
and
poor
ventilation
systems
lead
pollutants
to
build
up
inside
.

Anthony
J.
Iaciofano
,
a
lawyer
for
Burlington
,
said
the
company
believes
the
Beebes
'
symptoms
were
not
related
to
the
carpeting
.

He
said
that
ill
effects
from
new
carpets
manifest
themselves
immediately
but
that
the
Beebes
'
symptoms
appeared
months
later
.

Catherine
Adams
,
the
Beebes
'
lawyer
,
said
the
verdict
would
not
discourage
other
plaintiffs
from
filing
such
suits
.

Scientists
are
only
beginning
to
understand
what
causes
sick-building
syndrome
and
much
of
that
research
was
unavailable
when
the
Beebes
filed
the
case
,
she
said
.

The
Beebes
now
believe
that
a
prime
culprit
for
their
injuries
was
fumes
from
an
adhesive
used
in
the
carpeting
.

But
the
Beebes
did
n't
come
to
that
conclusion
until
time
limits
had
elapsed
for
adding
the
adhesives
maker
as
a
defendant
in
the
case
,
Ms.
Adams
said
.

The
Beebes
have
not
yet
decided
whether
to
appeal
.

TIMES
SQUARE
development
opponents
are
dealt
setback
.

The
Appellate
Division
of
New
York
State
Supreme
Court
dismissed
six
lawsuits
attempting
to
block
a
$
2.5
billion
project
planned
for
42nd
Street
in
Manhattan
.

Opponents
of
the
project
had
claimed
that
the
city
and
the
state
of
New
York
,
which
are
co-sponsoring
the
project
,
had
failed
to
adhere
to
environmental
guidelines
.

All
but
two
of
the
40
or
so
lawsuits
that
have
been
filed
since
the
project
's
1984
approval
have
been
dismissed
before
the
trial
stage
.

The
two
that
remain
have
n't
yet
reached
the
pre-trial
fact-finding
stage
.

State
officials
said
the
court
's
ruling
clears
the
way
for
proceedings
to
condemn
buildings
in
the
area
.

``
This
project
is
ready
to
move
,
''
said
State
Urban
Development
Corp.
Chairman
Vincent
Tese
.

But
developers
of
four
planned
office
towers
cautioned
that
obstacles
still
remain
.

As
part
of
the
agreement
with
the
state
,
the
developers
--
a
partnership
of
Park
Tower
Realty
and
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
--
said
they
would
not
proceed
with
condemnation
proceedings
while
there
was
``
significant
litigation
''
pending
.

Park
Tower
General
Counsel
Matthew
Mayer
said
the
development
team
will
have
to
review
two
additional
lawsuits
before
putting
up
a
$
155
million
letter
of
credit
to
cover
condemnation
costs
.

Also
,
he
said
,
the
partnership
is
waiting
to
see
whether
the
appellate
division
's
ruling
will
be
appealed
.

The
plan
,
which
has
been
plagued
with
delays
and
business-related
setbacks
,
seeks
to
transform
the
area
from
a
seedy
thoroughfare
to
a
more
wholesome
office
and
theater
district
.

State
and
city
officials
are
still
negotiating
with
developers
to
renovate
historic
theaters
and
build
and
operate
a
merchandise
mart
and
hotel
.

FEDERAL
JUDGE
EXPANDS
role
of
U.S.
courts
in
extradition
decisions
.

U.S.
District
Judge
Jack
B.
Weinstein
of
Brooklyn
,
N.Y.
,
ruled
that
a
man
implicated
in
an
attack
on
an
Israeli
passenger
bus
in
1986
can
be
extradited
to
Israel
for
trial
.

A
magistrate
had
initially
refused
the
request
,
ruling
that
the
attack
had
been
a
political
act
for
which
the
man
,
Mahmoud
El-Abed
Ahmad
,
would
be
exempt
from
extradition
.

However
,
Judge
Weinstein
wrote
in
his
opinion
late
last
month
that
terrorism
and
acts
of
war
against
civilians
can
not
be
defined
as
political
acts
.

Judge
Weinstein
also
ruled
that
judges
must
consider
prior
to
extradition
whether
the
defendant
will
be
treated
fairly
in
a
foreign
court
.

To
do
so
,
the
judge
said
,
the
U.S.
courts
must
review
the
judicial
process
in
the
foreign
country
independently
of
the
State
Department
's
assessment
.

He
said
that
in
this
case
he
concurred
with
the
State
Department
's
decision
that
Mr.
Ahmad
should
be
extradited
.

Mr.
Ahmad
's
lawyer
said
he
would
appeal
.

Lawyers
close
to
the
case
said
they
believed
the
ruling
was
unprecedented
.

``
Up
until
now
the
courts
have
said
it
is
not
their
role
to
supervise
the
foreign
country
's
courts
,
''
said
Jacques
Semmelman
,
the
assistant
U.S.
attorney
on
the
case
.

QUOTABLE
:
In
a
speech
prepared
for
delivery
in
New
York
yesterday
,
retired
Justice
Lewis
Powell
contested
the
notion
that
the
last
Supreme
Court
term
marked
a
turn
toward
conservatism
:
``
Commentators
who
agreed
on
little
else
unanimously
proclaimed
a
`
shift
in
direction
'
on
the
court
...
.

I
take
these
pronouncements
,
like
many
that
have
preceded
them
in
past
years
,
with
a
grain
of
salt
.

In
an
era
of
`
sound
bites
'
and
instant
opinion
polls
it
is
dangerous
to
apply
broad
labels
to
a
single
term
.

''
(
During
its
centennial
year
,
The
Wall
Street
Journal
will
report
events
of
the
past
century
that
stand
as
milestones
of
American
business
history
.

)
THE
YOM
KIPPUR
WAR
,
WHEN
EGYPT
CRASHED
into
Israel
on
Oct.
6
,
1973
,
the
holiest
day
in
the
Jewish
calendar
,
lasted
barely
a
month
.

But
one
far-afield
effect
is
still
with
us
.

The
Arab
states
,
always
bitterly
resentful
of
U.S.
support
toward
Israel
,
realized
they
held
an
irresistable
weapon
--
oil
.

Early
in
October
,
six
Arab
nations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
jacked
up
prices
sharply
.

On
Oct.
22
,
led
by
Saudi
Arabia
,
the
world
's
largest
exporter
,
they
embargoed
oil
shipments
to
the
U.S.
and
to
the
Netherlands
,
Israel
's
staunchest
European
ally
.

The
timing
was
perfect
.

The
Arabs
had
tried
embargos
before
.

In
1956
,
when
Britain
,
France
and
Israel
invaded
Egypt
to
seize
the
Suez
Canal
,
Arab
producers
cut
off
supplies
to
Europe
.

Texas
simply
pumped
harder
.

U.S.
oil
supplies
,
however
,
had
peaked
in
1970
and
1971
and
by
1973
were
declining
.

Imports
,
then
six
million
barrels
a
day
,
came
primarily
from
Venezuela
and
Canada
.

But
Middle
East
supplies
were
growing
in
importance
.

By
1973
,
the
U.S.
was
bringing
in
two
million
barrels
of
Arab
oil
a
day
,
more
than
10
%
of
the
17.3
million
barrels
consumed
daily
.

Politics
and
economics
conspired
.

Japan
and
Europe
,
far
more
dependent
on
Mideast
oil
than
the
U.S.
,
would
n't
offend
the
Arabs
or
trade
off
their
precious
supplies
.

The
U.S.
did
manage
to
supply
the
Dutch
with
oil
by
relabeling
supplies
;
once
oil
is
shipped
,
no
one
can
tell
its
source
.

But
car-happy
Americans
panicked
,
and
so
did
the
U.S.
and
other
oil-consuming
governments
.

``
Shortage
''
and
``
crisis
''
became
buzz
words
,
although
neither
really
applied
.

The
spot
dislocations
that
showed
up
were
largely
the
result
of
confusion
(
much
of
it
in
Washington
)
,
though
that
was
cold
comfort
for
drivers
waiting
in
mile-long
lines
at
the
gas
pumps
.

The
embargo
lasted
only
six
months
,
but
the
price
hikes
became
a
fact
of
life
.

What
the
Arabs
started
,
inflation
finished
.

Once
and
for
all
,
$
5-a-barrel
crude
oil
and
35-cents-a-gallon
gasoline
were
history
.

Times
may
be
tough
on
Wall
Street
for
some
,
but
a
few
bosses
are
making
as
much
as
ever
--
or
more
.

At
Bear
Stearns
Cos.
,
for
example
,
the
15
executive
officers
led
by
Chairman
Alan
``
Ace
''
Greenberg
got
a
pay
increase
to
$
35.9
million
for
the
14-month
period
ended
June
30
from
$
22.9
million
for
the
12
months
ended
April
30
,
1988
.

The
figures
do
n't
include
substantial
dividends
on
holdings
of
Bear
Stearns
stock
.

Mr.
Greenberg
himself
was
paid
$
4.5
million
,
before
an
estimated
$
1.5
million
in
dividends
,
up
from
$
2.4
million
the
year
before
.

The
increase
is
noted
in
the
brokerage
firm
's
latest
proxy
statement
filed
with
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

Because
it
operates
on
a
fiscal
year
,
Bear
Stearns
's
yearly
filings
are
available
much
earlier
than
those
of
other
firms
.

The
latest
period
includes
14
months
instead
of
12
because
Bear
Stearns
changed
to
a
fiscal
year
ending
in
June
instead
of
April
.

Meanwhile
,
Bear
Stearns
's
650
stock
and
bond
salesmen
saw
thinner
paychecks
over
the
past
year
,
which
the
company
says
reflected
lower
commission
revenue
caused
by
a
decline
in
investor
activity
in
the
markets
.

However
,
Bear
Stearns
on
Monday
reported
improved
earnings
for
its
first
quarter
,
ended
Sept.
29
,
partly
because
of
a
31
%
increase
in
commissions
during
the
quarter
.

William
J.
Montgoris
,
chief
financial
officer
,
defended
the
lofty
salaries
at
Bear
Stearns
.

``
All
of
us
are
on
a
base
salary
of
$
200,000
if
the
firm
makes
nothing
--
and
that
's
pretty
low
as
far
as
Wall
Street
goes
,
''
Mr.
Montgoris
said
.

However
,
Bear
Stearns
has
never
had
an
unprofitable
year
since
its
founding
65
years
ago
.

Four
Bear
Stearns
executives
besides
the
62-year-old
Mr.
Greenberg
were
paid
$
3
million
or
more
before
dividends
for
the
14
months
ended
in
June
.

According
to
the
proxy
statement
,
James
E.
Cayne
,
55
,
Bear
Stearns
's
president
,
made
$
3.9
million
;
an
executive
vice
president
,
Michael
L.
Tarnopol
,
53
,
made
nearly
$
3.4
million
;
and
two
executive
vice
presidents
,
Vincent
J.
Mattone
,
44
,
and
William
J.
Michaelcheck
,
42
,
made
about
$
3.3
million
each
.

Mr.
Montgoris
said
the
firm
has
a
``
straight
mathematical
formula
''
for
determining
compensation
,
based
on
the
firm
's
earnings
.

``
Just
because
a
particular
element
of
the
firm
is
down
,
''
such
as
stockbrokerage
,
``
does
n't
mean
the
executive
committee
should
be
paid
less
,
''
he
said
.

Morgan
Grenfell
Group
PLC
said
John
Craven
,
group
chief
executive
officer
,
is
taking
over
the
chairmanship
of
the
merchant
banking
group
from
Sir
Peter
Carey
,
who
is
retiring
.

Mr.
Carey
will
remain
a
member
of
the
merchant
bank
's
board
.

Mr.
Craven
is
widely
credited
with
refocusing
Morgan
Grenfell
's
energies
on
its
core
corporate
finance
,
fund
management
and
banking
activities
over
the
past
year
.

Last
year
,
Morgan
Grenfell
shut
down
its
ailing
U.K.
securities
operations
.

Mr.
Craven
said
his
move
to
the
chairmanship
means
he
will
take
a
less
active
role
in
the
day-to-day
management
of
the
group
,
but
he
added
that
the
merchant
bank
's
strategic
focus
remains
unchanged
.

Mr.
Craven
joined
Morgan
Grenfell
as
group
chief
executive
in
May
1987
,
a
few
months
after
the
resignations
of
former
Chief
Executive
Christopher
Reeves
and
other
top
officials
because
of
the
merchant
bank
's
role
in
Guinness
PLC
's
controversial
takeover
of
Distiller
's
Co.
in
1986
.

Morgan
Grenfell
had
advised
Guinness
on
the
bid
,
which
was
surrounded
by
allegations
that
Guinness
used
artificial
means
to
support
the
bid
's
value
.

Morgan
Grenfell
said
Michael
Dobson
,
currently
group
deputy
chief
executive
,
will
assume
the
chief
executive
position
.

The
merchant
bank
also
announced
that
finance
director
David
Eward
is
taking
early
retirement
for
personal
reasons
.

His
duties
will
be
taken
over
by
Anthony
Richmond-Watson
,
who
has
been
elected
deputy
chairman
.

News
of
Mr.
Eward
's
retirement
comes
one
day
after
Morgan
said
that
Christopher
Whittington
resigned
as
chairman
of
Morgan
's
banking
subsidiary
to
join
a
financial
services
firm
.

Mr.
Craven
said
both
Messrs.
Eward
and
Whittington
had
planned
to
leave
the
bank
earlier
,
but
Mr.
Craven
had
persuaded
them
to
remain
until
the
bank
was
in
a
healthy
position
.

``
If
there
's
any
coincidence
about
the
departures
it
's
that
they
are
leaving
at
a
time
when
the
business
is
in
reasonably
good
shape
and
going
forward
very
well
.

Par
Pharmaceutical
Inc.
said
it
named
its
interim
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
Kenneth
I.
Sawyer
,
to
those
posts
permanently
,
and
elected
him
to
the
board
.

Par
also
said
it
was
advised
by
the
U.S.
attorney
for
Maryland
that
it
is
one
of
a
number
of
companies
being
investigated
by
a
federal
grand
jury
for
alleged
violations
of
the
federal
Food
,
Drug
and
Cosmetic
Act
.

Par
,
a
generic-drug
maker
that
has
been
plagued
by
management
problems
,
was
already
the
subject
of
a
federal
criminal
inquiry
into
the
drug-approval
process
and
a
Food
and
Drug
Administration
investigation
.

A
Par
spokesman
said
he
understood
the
criminal
investigation
in
Maryland
relates
to
matters
Par
disclosed
in
July
,
when
Par
said
it
filed
false
drug
information
with
the
FDA
.

At
the
time
,
the
company
said
it
was
recalling
one
of
its
drugs
and
had
stopped
selling
two
others
.

The
spokesman
said
he
also
understood
that
the
inquiry
related
to
the
existence
of
an
``
off-the-record
''
production
book
.

The
book
noted
changes
made
at
the
manufacturing
level
that
were
n't
disclosed
to
the
FDA
.

Par
said
it
is
cooperating
in
the
investigation
.

Also
yesterday
,
Ashok
Patel
,
a
former
Par
official
who
pleaded
guilty
to
providing
an
FDA
employee
an
illegal
gratuity
of
$
3,000
,
was
sentenced
by
a
federal
judge
in
Baltimore
to
one
year
of
community
service
and
a
$
150,000
fine
.

Mr.
Patel
also
was
placed
on
three
years
'
probation
.

Mr.
Patel
resigned
as
senior
vice
president
of
Par
in
April
.

In
July
,
Par
and
a
60%-owned
unit
agreed
to
plead
guilty
in
that
inquiry
,
as
did
another
former
Par
official
.

Mr.
Sawyer
began
running
the
company
on
an
interim
basis
in
late
September
.

Par
said
it
selected
him
for
the
posts
of
president
and
chief
executive
on
a
permanent
basis
because
of
his
experience
in
the
industry
and
his
performance
at
Par
.

Perry
Levine
,
chairman
,
said
Mr.
Sawyer
had
``
taken
significant
steps
''
to
restore
the
company
's
credibility
and
sense
of
professionalism
and
integrity
.

Just
after
midnight
Monday
,
federal
spending
started
to
drop
by
$
16
billion
.

What
do
you
say
we
all
close
down
the
poker
game
,
go
home
and
bank
the
$
16
billion
?
That
's
essentially
what
budget
director
Richard
Darman
is
suggesting
,
and
we
think
he
deserves
as
much
support
as
he
can
get
.

If
human
beings
ca
n't
cut
federal
spending
honestly
--
and
they
ca
n't
--
let
the
computers
do
it
.

Congress
,
with
a
measure
of
White
House
complicity
,
has
been
manipulating
the
spending
accounts
for
years
under
the
cover
of
omnibus
appropriations
bills
.

(
Indeed
without
earlier
manipulations
,
the
current
sequester
of
$
16
billion
would
have
been
even
larger
.

)
We
suspect
voters
are
fed
up
with
the
finagling
.

Consider
,
for
instance
,
that
even
yesterday
's
widely
publicized
sequester
is
likely
to
be
traduced
if
business
as
usual
is
allowed
to
prevail
.

Under
the
law
,
Gramm-Rudman
's
across-the-board-cuts
in
federal
programs
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
.

Social
Security
and
spending
for
poor
people
are
exempted
.

However
,
the
Associated
Press
's
account
of
the
Monday
sequester
order
signed
by
President
Bush
neatly
captured
the
contempt
Congress
shows
toward
the
notion
of
a
legally
binding
commitment
:
``
Lawmakers
have
been
saying
for
weeks
that
they
plan
to
roll
back
the
cuts
as
soon
as
they
agree
to
a
compromise
on
a
deficit-cutting
bill
.

''
Mr.
Darman
's
inclination
to
save
the
sequester
was
backed
up
yesterday
by
White
House
Press
Secretary
Marlin
Fitzwater
:
``
There
is
some
feeling
here
that
the
cuts
are
the
way
to
go
.

It
will
reduce
spending
in
a
very
effective
fashion
.

''
This
attitude
is
being
waved
away
by
sophisticates
around
Washington
as
little
more
than
tough
talk
.

It
looks
to
us
like
a
golden
opportunity
for
George
Bush
to
chop
off
at
the
knees
all
this
talk
about
a
timid
,
unserious
presidency
.

Mr.
Bush
would
be
acting
in
the
public
interest
if
he
let
the
Washington
elites
who
manipulate
these
budgets
--
the
bureaucrats
,
the
lobbyists
,
the
congressional
staffers
--
live
for
just
one
year
on
a
restricted
diet
.

Ask
Tommy
Lasorda
;
thin
is
in
.

Senator
Phil
Gramm
pointed
out
Monday
that
in
the
20
years
before
Gramm-Rudman
was
enacted
in
1985
,
federal
spending
grew
by
about
11
%
a
year
;
since
the
law
,
it
's
grown
at
under
5
%
annually
.

Another
major
factor
in
this
positive
trend
was
Ronald
Reagan
's
decision
early
in
his
presidency
to
fight
the
budget
war
on
the
expenditure
side
rather
than
raising
taxes
.

George
Bush
's
continued
support
of
the
tax
dam
sustains
this
strategy
of
pressuring
Congress
to
make
choices
among
competing
priorities
,
rather
than
just
saying
yes
to
all
the
grateful
special-interest
constituencies
that
fill
the
PAC
trough

If
Washington
's
elites
ever
succeed
in
bursting
the
tax
dam
,
Americans
will
be
engulfed
in
a
red
sea
of
new
spending
programs
,
such
as
federalized
child
care
.

Child
care
was
one
of
the
many
``
extraneous
''
bills
pulled
out
of
the
Senate
's
reconciliation
bill
last
Friday
.

Others
were
the
capital-gains
cut
,
Section
89
repeal
,
the
disabled
workers
bill
,
and
the
unprecedented
reconsideration
of
the
catastrophic
health
act
.

All
this
stuff
still
is
in
the
House
's
1,878-page
reconciliation
bill
,
and
many
Members
say
they
're
reluctant
to
pull
out
cherished
bills
,
just
to
see
them
die
.

Republicans
especially
want
a
guarantee
from
the
House
leadership
that
they
'll
get
an
up-or-down
vote
on
the
bills
.

House
Speaker
Foley
ought
to
deliver
that
promise
.

This
is
the
way
government
is
supposed
to
work
,
with
politicians
taking
responsibility
for
votes
that
their
constituents
can
identify
,
instead
of
concealing
them
in
the
great
reconciliation
garbage
truck
.

We
have
as
much
nostalgia
as
anyone
for
those
leafy
,
breezy
days
in
Washington
when
honorable
men
and
women
dickered
over
budgets
and
even
log-rolled
a
bit
to
see
that
the
bridges
got
build
,
roads
paved
,
soldiers
paid
or
that
the
desperately
poor
were
cared
for
.

Those
days
are
gone
.

Nor
do
we
see
any
reason
to
believe
that
a
metropolitan
Washington
that
has
gotten
fat
and
rich
and
lazy
in
the
shadow
of
the
federal
colossus
will
change
much
on
its
own
initiative
.

Save
the
sequester
,
and
let
Washington
scream
.

The

The

earlier
this

was
the
lowest

three
years

The

Northern
Trust
Corp.
said
its
board
adopted
a
shareholder
rights
plan
aimed
at
deterring
unwanted
takeover
bids
,
but
said
it
's
not
aware
of
any
plan
to
acquire
the
banking
concern
.

Under
Northern
Trust
's
plan
,
shareholders
were
issued
rights
that
,
in
the
event
of
certain
attempted
takeovers
,
allow
holders
to
buy
shares
in
the
company
at
half
price
.

National
Patent
Development
Corp.
said
it
plans
to
purchase
as
many
as
200,000
common
shares
of
its
81%-controlled
Interferon
Sciences
Inc.
unit
in
periodic
,
open-market
purchases
.

The
200,000
shares
are
about
23
%
of
Interferon
's
common
shares
outstanding
,
excluding
National
Patent
's
stake
.

Noting
the
recent
Food
and
Drug
Administration
approval
of
Interferon
's
genital
warts
treatment
,
National
Patent
said
it
believes
Interferon
's
stock
is
undervalued
.

Japanese
investors
,
reassured
by
Monday
's
strong
rally
on
Wall
Street
,
erased
most
of
that
day
's
losses
on
the
Tokyo
Stock
Exchange
.

But
analysts
said
the
rebound
did
n't
remove
the
cautious
mood
from
the
market
.

In
London
,
stocks
closed
lower
in
volatile
trading
as
an
opening
rally
was
obliterated
by
worse-than-expected
U.S.
trade
figures
.

Paris
shares
had
a
similar
reaction
,
but
most
other
European
bourses
posted
gains
,
as
did
all
major
Asian
and
Pacific
stock
markets
.

Tokyo
's
Nikkei
Index
of
225
stocks
jumped
527.39
points
to
close
at
34996.08
.

The
rise
came
a
day
after
the
year
's
biggest
drop
on
Monday
,
when
the
Nikkei
fell
647.33
,
or
1.8
%
,
in
response
to
Friday
's
6.9
%
plunge
on
Wall
Street
.

In
early
trading
Wednesday
in
Tokyo
,
the
Nikkei
index
rose
19.30
points
to
35015.38
.

On
Tuesday
,
the
broader-based
Tokyo
Stock
Price
Index
of

listed
in
the

,
which
fell
45.66
Monday
,
rose
41.76
,
or
1.61
%
,
to
2642.64
.

Trading
was
relatively
thin
at
an
estimated
650
million
shares
,
though
brisker
than
Monday
's
526
million
.

``
We
're
back
to
square
one
,
''
said
Simon
Smithson
,
an
analyst
in
Japan
for
Kleinwort
Benson
International
Inc
.

Japanese
domestic
institutions
,
including
trust
banks
and
investment
management
firms
,
that
had
been
on
the
sidelines
during
Monday
's
fall
were
back
in
the
market
,
analysts
said
.

Foreign
investors
reportedly
started
off
selling
but
later
joined
in
the
buying
.

The
Tokyo
rally
seemed
to
confirm
the
view
,
frequently
expressed
in
Japan
in
the
past
few
days
,
that
the
drop
in
New
York
was
a
local
problem
related
to
merger
and
acquisition
activity
in
the
U.S
.

``
This
time
we
do
n't
really
have
to
worry
about
Tokyo
,
''
said
an
official
at
Daiwa
Securities
Co
.

``
Nothing
has
changed
fundamentally
in
the
Tokyo
market
.

''
But
even
though
Tokyo
appears
unharmed
by
recent
market
volatility
,
analysts
and
traders
say
there
are
still
a
few
concerns
on
the
horizon
.

In
particular
,
Japanese
investors
will
be
keeping
a
wary
eye
on
Wall
Street
to
see
whether
Monday
's
88.12-point
rally
holds
up
as
fresh
U.S.
economic
data
are
released
.

``
People
are
placing
small
bets
.

There
's
no
huge
buying
,
''
said
Stephen
Hill
,
head
of
equity
sales
at
Jardine
Fleming
Securities
Ltd.
in
Tokyo
.

``
Really
brave
views
right
now
would
be
foolhardy
.

''
Yesterday
's
buyers
favored
real
estate
,
construction
and
other
large-capitalization
issues
,
reflecting
the
fact
that
many
Tokyo
investors
now
feel
safer
with
domestically
oriented
stocks
,
analysts
said
.

They
also
are
concerned
about
the
persistent
strength
of
the
dollar
against
the
yen
,
as
a
weaker
yen
leads
to
higher
import
prices
in
Japan
and
adds
to
domestic
inflationary
pressures
.

Currency
concerns
also
weigh
heavily
on
interest
rate-sensitive
stocks
such
as
banking
and
other
financial
issues
because
of
fears
that
Japanese
interest
rates
might
have
to
rise
to
keep
the
dollar
in
check
.

Among
steel
shares
,
NKK
rose
19
to
705
yen
(
$
4.97
)
a
share
,
and
Nippon
Steel
gained
17
to
735
.

Construction
shares
that
gained
included
Shimizu
,
which
rose
130
to
2,080
.

In
the
real
estate
sector
,
Mitsui
Real
Estate
Development
was
up
100
at

and
Mitsubishi

London
's
Financial
Times-Stock
Exchange
100-share
index
fell
27.9
points
to
2135.5

It
was
down
more
than
40
points
a
half-hour
before
the
close
,
marking
a
61.5-point
turnaround
from
its
high
,
reached
in
the
first
15
minutes
of
trading
.

The
narrower
Financial
Times
30-share
index
fell
29.6
to
1730.7
.

Volume
was
an
active
643.3
million
shares
,
about
double
the
recent
levels
but
down
from
959.3
million
the
previous
day
,
which
U.K.
traders
have
dubbed
``
Manic

.

''
Prices
opened
strongly
on
the
basis
of
Monday
's
Wall
Street
rally
and
yesterday
's
gains
in
Tokyo
.

But
the
advance
faltered
as
index-options
traders
and
investors
jittery
about
the
U.K.
economic
outlook
took
over
.

The
unexpectedly
wide
U.S.
August
trade
deficit
of
$
10.77
billion
hit
an
already
jittery
U.K.
market
in
midafternoon
.

Michael
Hicks
,
who
manages
sales
and
trading
for
brokerage
concern
Societe
Generale
Strauss
Turnbull
,
said
:
``
It
's
a
nervous
market
.

It
was
all
over
the
place
.

If
you

,
you
wish

had
n't
,
and
if
you
sold
,
you
wish
you
had
n't
.

''
He
said
the
current
market
``
is
all
about
sentiment
,
and
the
sentiment
in
London
is
90
%
anxiety
and
worry
.

''
Britain
's
economic
fundamentals
,
he
said
,
``
do
n't
look
very
bright
.

''
Dealers
said
London
showed
signs
of
calming
in
midafternoon
after
Wall
Street
avoided
sharp
losses
despite
the
trade
report
,
but
a
wave
of
futures-related
selling
later
in
the
session
sent
buyers
back
to
the
sidelines
.

Still
,
some
sectors
found
buying
interest
after
being
actively
sold
in
recent
weeks
.

Merchant
banks
were
stronger
across
the
board
.

Morgan
Grenfell
,
which
has
been
mentioned
in
takeover
rumors
,
rose
20
to
392
pence
(
$
6.18
)
a
share
.

S.G.
Warburg
,
a
rumored
target
of
some
European
banking
concerns
,
finished
22
higher
at
400
.

Hambros
rose
5
to
204
,
and
Schroders
rose
25
to
#
12.75
.

On
the
corporate
front
,
Ford
Motor
announced
that
it
raised
its
stake
in
U.K.
luxury
car
maker
Jaguar
to
10.4
%
from
5
%
.

Jaguar
shares
jumped
23
before
easing
to
close
at
654
,
up
6
.

Amstrad
,
a
British
computer
hardware
and
communications
equipment
maker
,
eased
4
to
47
.

It
announced
a
52
%
plunge
in
pretax
profit
for
the
latest
year
.

Brewery
stocks
were
firm
to
higher
on
talk
of
early
bargain-hunting
,
but
most
ended
below
their
peaks
.

Bass

Guinness
closed
at

,
down

and
Scottish

Newcastle
dropped
11
to

but
Whitbread
Class
A
shares
rose
17
to
363
.

Dealers
said
there
was
late
talk
of
a
Whitbread
sale
of
brewing
operations
to
Scottish
&
Newcastle
.

The
most
active
shares
were
major
blue-chips
,
particularly
oils
and
utilities
such
as
British
Gas
and
British
Telecommunications
.

Traders
attributed
the
action
in
them
largely
to
defensive
positioning
in
a
volatile
market
.

British
Gas
finished
at
197
,
down
2
,
on
13
million
shares
,
British
Petroleum
fell
8
to
291
on
9.4
million

,
and
British
Telecom
was
4
lower
at
261
on
turnover
of
10
million
shares
.

Cable
&
Wireless
fell
20
to
478
.

Also
in
active
trading
,
British
Steel
fell
1
to
124
as
20
million
shares
changed
hands
.

Racal
Electric
,
which
traded
11
million
shares
,
declined
12
to
218
.

In
other
European
markets
,
share
prices
closed
sharply
higher
in
Frankfurt
and
Zurich
and
posted
moderate
rises
in
Stockholm
,
Amsterdam
and
Milan
.

Paris
closed
lower
,
and
most
Brussels
shares
were
unable
to
trade
for
a
second
consecutive
day
because
of
technical
problems
.

South
African
gold
stocks
closed
higher

Elsewhere
,
share
prices
rebounded
in
Hong

,
Sydney

Taipei
,
Manila

In

stocks
recovered
one-third
to
one-half
of

The
stock
market
's
dizzying
gyrations
during
the
past
few
days
have
made
a
lot
of
individual
investors
wish
they
could
buy
some
sort
of
insurance
.

After
all
,
they
wo
n't
soon
forget
the
stock
bargains
that
became
available
after
the
October
1987
crash
.

But
while
they
want
to
be
on
the
alert
for
similar
buying
opportunities
now
,
they
're
afraid
of
being
hammered
by
another
terrifying
plunge
.

The
solution
,
at
least
for
some
investors
,
may
be
a
hedging
technique
that
's
well
known
to
players
in
the
stock-options
market
.

Called
a
``
married
put
,
''
the
technique
is
carried
out
by
purchasing
a
stock
and
simultaneously
buying
a
put
option
on
that
stock
.

It
's
like
``
fire
insurance
,
''
says
Harrison
Roth
,
the
senior
options
strategist
at
Cowen
&
Co
.

Because
a
put
option
gives
its
owner
the
right
,
but
not
the
obligation
,
to
sell
a
fixed
number
of
shares
of
the
stock
at
a
stated
price
on
or
before
the
option
's
expiration
date
,
the
investor
is
protected
against
a
sudden
drop
in
the
stock
's
price
.

But
most
investment
advisers
do
n't
recommend
using
married
puts
all
the
time
.

That
's
because
the
cost
of
buying
put
options
eats
into
an
investor
's
profit
when
stock
prices
rise
.

``
This
is
the
type
of
fire
insurance
you
only
buy
when
the
nearby
woods
are
on
fire
,
''
says
Mr.
Roth
.

``
You
always
want
your
house
insured
,
but
you
do
n't
always
feel
the
need
for
your
investments
to
be
insured
.

''
In
addition
to
hedging
new
stock
purchases
,
the
married-put
technique
can
be
used
to
protect
stocks
that
an
investor
already
owns
.

In
either
case
,
the
investor
faces
three
possible
outcomes
:
--
If
the
stock
goes
up
in
price
between
now
and
the
put
's
expiration
date
,
the
put
will
probably
expire
worthless
.

The
investor
will
be
out
the
cost
of
the
put
,
which
is
called
the
``
premium
,
''
and
this
loss
will
reduce
the
stock-market
profit
.

--
If
the
stock
stays
at
the
same
price
between
now
and
the
put
's
expiration
date
,
the
investor
's
loss
will
be
limited
to
the
cost
of
the
put
,
less
any
amount
realized
from
a
closing
sale
of
the
put
.

The
worst-case
scenario
would
be
if
the
put
expires
worthless
.

--
If
the
price
of
the
stock
declines
,
the
put
will
increase
in
value
.

Once
the
stock
price
is
less
than
the
exercise
price
,
or
``
strike
price
,
''
of
the
put
,
the
gain
will
match
the
loss
on
the
stock
dollar
for
dollar
.

The
put
establishes
a
minimum
selling
price
for
the
stock
during
its
life
.

When
a
stock
falls
below
the
put
's
strike
price
,
the
investor
simply
sells
the
stock
at
a
loss
and
simultaneously
sells
the
put
at
a
profit
.

Or
,
the
investor
can
exercise
the
put
,
by
tendering
the
stock
to
his
or
her
broker
in
return
for
payment
from
another
investor
who
has
sold
a
put
on
the
same
stock
.

Brokers
handle
such
transactions
through
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
guarantees
all
option
trades
.

The
accompanying
table
shows
how
this
strategy
would
work
for
three
stocks
.

Though
not
reflected
in
the
table
,
an
investor
should
know
that
the
cost
of
the
option
insurance
can
be
partially
offset
by
any
dividends
that
the
stock
pays
.

For
example
,
Tenneco
Inc.
pays
a
quarterly
dividend
of
76
cents
,
which
would
be
received
before
the
February
option
expires
and
,
thus
,
reduce
the
cost
of
using
the
technique
by
that
amount
.

In
this
case
,
the
investor
's
risk
would
n't
exceed
3.6
%
of
the
total
investment
.

To
simplify
the
calculations
,
commissions
on
the
option
and
underlying
stock
are
n't
included
in
the
table
.

There
are
more
than
650
stocks
on
which
options
may
be
bought
and
sold
,
including
some
over-the-counter
stocks
.

But
some
investors
might
prefer
a
simpler
strategy
then
hedging
their
individual
holdings
.

They
can
do
this
by
purchasing
``
index
puts
,
''
which
are
simply
put
options
on
indexes
that
match
broad
baskets
of
stocks
.

For
instance
,
the
most
popular
index
option
is
the
S&P
100
option
,
commonly
called
the
OEX
.

It
is
based
on
the
stocks
that
make
up
Standard
&
Poor
's
100-stock
index
.

Unlike
options
on
individual
issues
,
index
options
are
settled
only
in
cash
,
and
no
stock
is
ever
tendered
.

But
while
index
options
are
convenient
,
they
have
several
disadvantages
.

For
one
thing
,
an
investor
's
portfolio
might
not
closely
match
the
S&P
100
.

As
a
result
,
the
OEX
insurance
may
or
may
not
fully
protect
an
investor
's
holdings
in
the
event
of
a
market
decline
.

In
addition
,
OEX
options
were
suspended
from
trading
last
Friday
afternoon
,
after
the
stock-market
sell-off
got
under
way
and
trading
in
the
S&P-500
futures
contract
was
halted
.

So
an
investor
who
wanted
to
realize
a
profit
on
OEX
puts
after
the
trading
suspension
would
have
been
out
of
luck
.

On
the
other
hand
,
only
a
handful
of
individual
issues
were
suspended
from
trading
on
Friday
.

Normally
,
once
the
underlying
investment
is
suspended
from
trading
,
the
options
on
those
investments
also
do
n't
trade
.

Ultimately
,
whether
the
insurance
provided
by
purchasing
puts
is
worthwhile
depends
on
the
cost
of
the
options
.

That
cost
rises
in
times
of
high
market
volatility
.

But
it
still
might
be
cheaper
than
taking
a
major
hit
.

The
protection
from
using
married
puts
is
clearly
superior
to
that
afforded
by
another
options
strategy
some
investors
consider
using
during
troubled
times
:
selling
call
options
on
stocks
the
investor
owns
.

A
call
option
is
similar
to
a
put
,
except
that
it
gives
its
owner
the
right
to
buy
shares
at
a
stated
price
until
expiration
.

Selling
a
call
option
gives
an
investor
a
small
buffer
against
a
stock-market
decline
.

That
's
because
it
reduces
the
cost
of
the
stock
by
the
amount
of
premium
received
from
the
sale
of
the
call
.

But
if
the
price
of
the
stock
rises
above
the
strike
price
of
the
option
,
the
stock
is
almost
certain
to
be
called
away
.

And
in
that
case
,
the
investor
misses
out
on
any
major
upside
gain
.

These
calculations
exclude
the
effect
of
commissions
paid
and
dividends
received
from
the
stock
.

All
prices
are
as
of
Monday
's
close
.

Hopes
for
quick
enactment
of
pending
deficit-reduction
legislation
faded
as
efforts
to
streamline
the
House
version
in
advance
of
a
House-Senate
conference
broke
down
.

House
leaders
had
hoped
to
follow
the
Senate
's
lead
by
getting
an
agreement
from
House
committee
chairmen
under
which
they
would
drop
items
that
would
n't
reduce
the
fiscal
1990
budget
deficit
from
the
House-passed
bill
before
the
negotiations
with
the
Senate
began
.

But
the
effort
became
snagged
on
the
question
of
what
would
become
of
other
issues
,
ranging
from
cutting
the
capital-gains
tax
to
child
care
to
repeal
of
catastrophic-illness
insurance
.

``
Many
members
feel
there
are
important
features
of
the
House
bill
that
should
be
enacted
,
''
Speaker
Thomas
Foley
(
D.
,
Wash
.

)
said
.

``
If
there
is
any
support
for
reducing
the
bill
,
it
is
conditioned
on
their
desire
to
see
them
passed
in
another
form
.

''
Now
those
items
will
be
discussed
in
a
House-Senate
conference
,
which
could
begin
as
soon
as
today
,
with
the
expectation
that
they
could
either
be
resolved
there
or
placed
into
other
legislation
.

``
You
've
got
to
give
these
chairmen
the
opportunity
to
see
if
they
can
work
things
out
,
''
said
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Leon
Panetta
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
.

``
This
is
a
democratic
process
--
you
ca
n't
slam-dunk
anything
around
here
.

''
White
House
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
has
said
he
would
continue
to
press
to
keep
the
capital-gains
provision
in
the
final
version
of
the
bill
unless
the
House
drops
many
of
its
costly
provisions
.

Senate
leaders
had
hoped
to
be
able
to
send
a
compromise
version
of
the
measure
to
President
Bush
by
the
end
of
the
week
,
but
Speaker
Foley
said
that
was
n't
likely
.

Failure
to
pass
the
bill
meant
that
$
16.1
billion
in
across-the-board
spending
cuts
took
effect
Monday
under
the
Gramm-Rudman
budget
law
.

The
bill
must
be
enacted
before
the
cuts
can
be
restored
.

Cincinnati

A
surprising
surge
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
raised
fears
that
the
nation
's
export
drive
has
stalled
,
and
caused
new
turmoil
in
financial
markets
.

The
merchandise
trade
deficit
widened
in
August
to
$
10.77
billion
,
the
Commerce
Department
reported
,
a
sharp
deterioration
from
July
's
$
8.24
billion
and
the
largest
deficit
of
any
month
this
year
.

Exports
fell
for
the
second
month
in
a
row
,
while
imports
rose
to
a
record
.

``
This
is
one
of
the
worst
trade
releases
we
've
had
since
the
dollar
troughed
out
in
1987
,
''
said
Geoffrey
Dennis
,
chief
international
economist
at
James
Capel
Inc
.

Like
most
analysts
,
Mr.
Dennis
was
hesitant
to
read
too
much
into
one
month
's
numbers
;
but
he
said
,
``
It
indicates
perhaps
that
the
balance
in
the
U.S.
economy
is
not
as
good
as
we
've
been
led
to
believe
.

''
The
number
had
a
troubling
effect
on
Wall
Street
,
suggesting
that
more
fundamental
economic
problems
may
underlie
last
Friday
's
stock
market
slide
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
tumbled
more
than
60
points
after
the
report
's
release
,
before
recovering
to
close
18.65
points
lower
at
2638.73
.

``
This
bad
trade
number
raises
some
deeper
issues
about
the
market
decline
,
''
said
Norman
Robertson
,
chief
economist
for
Mellon
Bank
.

``
It
raises
questions
about
more
deep-seated
problems
,
the
budget
deficit
and
the
trade
deficit
and
the
seeming
lack
of
ability
to
come
to
grips
with
them
.

''
The
trade
report
drew
yet
another
unsettling
parallel
to
October
1987
.

On
Oct.
14
of
that
year
,
the
announcement
of
an
unusually
large
August
trade
deficit
helped
trigger
a
steep
market
decline
.

The
slide
continued
until
the
record
508-point
market
drop
on
Oct.
19
.

In
1987
,
however
,
the
news
was
the
latest
in
a
string
of
disappointments
on
trade
,
while
the
current
report
comes
after
a
period
of
improvement
.

The
bleak
trade
report
was
played
down
by
the
Bush
administration
.

Commerce
Secretary
Robert
Mosbacher
called
the
worsening
trade
figures
``
disappointing
after
two
very
good
months
.

''
And
White
House
spokesman
Marlin
Fitzwater
said
the
deficit
was
``
an
unwelcome
increase
,
''
adding
that
``
we
're
hopeful
that
it
simply
is
a
one-month
situation
and
will
turn
around
.

''
But
the
figures
reinforced
the
view
of
many
private
analysts
that
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
has
run
out
of
steam
.

``
The
figures
today
add
further
evidence
to
support
the
view
that
the
improvement
in
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
has
essentially
stalled
out
at
a
level
of
about
a
$
110
billion
annual
rate
,
''
said
Jeffrey
Scott
,
a
research
fellow
at
the
Institute
for
International
Economics
here
.

``
That
's
still
an
improvement
over
last
year
,
but
it
leads
one
to
conclude
that
basically
we
've
gotten
all
the
mileage
we
can
out
of
past
dollar
depreciation
and
past
marginal
cuts
in
the
federal
budget
deficit
.

''
Exports
declined
for
the
second
consecutive
month
in
August
,
slipping
0.2
%
to
$
30.41
billion
,
the
Commerce
Department
reported
.

Imports
,
on
the
other
hand
,
leaped
6.4
%
to
a
record
$
41.18
billion
.

Not
only
was
August
's
deficit
far
worse
than
July
's
,
but
the
government
revised
the
July
figure
substantially
from
the
$
7.58
billion
deficit
it
had
initially
reported
last
month
.

Many
economists
contend
that
deep
cuts
in
the
U.S.
budget
deficit
are
needed
before
further
trade
improvement
can
occur
.

That
's
because
the
budget
deficit
feeds
an
enormous
appetite
in
this
country
for
both
foreign
goods
and
foreign
capital
,
overwhelming
the
nation
's
capacity
to
export
.

``
People
are
sick
and
tired
of
hearing
about
these
deficits
,
but
the
imbalances
are
still
there
and
they
are
still
a
problem
,
''
said
Mr.
Robertson
.

In
addition
,
the
rise
in
the
value
of
the
dollar
against
foreign
currencies
over
the
past
several
months
has
increased
the
price
of
U.S.
products
in
overseas
markets
and
hurt
the
country
's
competitiveness
.

Since
March
,
exports
have
been
virtually
flat
.

At
the
same
time
,
William
T.
Archey
,
international
vice
president
at
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
notes
:
``
Clearly
the
stronger
dollar
has
made
imports
more
attractive
''
by
causing
their
prices
to
decline
.

Most
economists
expect
the
slowing
U.S.
economy
to
curb
demand
for
imports
.

But
they
foresee
little
substantial
progress
in
exports
unless
the
dollar
and
the
federal
budget
deficit
come
down
.

``
The
best
result
we
could
get
from
these
numbers
would
be
to
see
the
administration
and
Congress
get
serious
about
putting
the
U.S.
on
an
internationally
competitive
economic
footing
,
''
said
Howard
Lewis
,
vice
president
of
international
economic
affairs
at
the
National
Association
of
Manufacturers
.

``
That
must
start
with
cutting
the
federal
budget
deficit
.

''
August
's
decline
in
exports
reflected
decreases
in
sales
of
industrial
supplies
,
capital
goods
and
food
abroad
and
increases
in
sales
of
motor
vehicles
,
parts
and
engines
.

The
jump
in
imports
stemmed
from
across-the-board
increases
in
purchases
of
foreign
goods
.

The
numbers
were
adjusted
for
usual
seasonal
fluctuations

%
,
if
the
buyer
chooses
a
hard-disk
drive
as
an
alternative
to
Next
's
optical-storage
device
.

The
hard
drive
,
which
is
the
storage
device
of
choice
for
virtually
every
desktop
computer
user
,
also
now
will
supplement
Next
's
futuristic
optical
device
if
buyers
pay
full
price
.

Mr.
Jobs
,
co-founder
of
Apple
Computer
Inc.
,
founded
Next
four
years
ago
in
the
hopes
of
fomenting
a
revolution
in
the
way
desktop
computers
are
designed
and
used
.

His
Next
computer
,
introduced
about
a
year
ago
and
aimed
primarily
at
university
computer
users
,
sports
snazzy
graphics
,
digital
sound
,
built-in
networking
and
a
sleek
black
design
.

But
the
computer
was
proving
a
hard
sell
because
of
its
high
price
,
a
lack
of
software
and
an
optical
data-storage
device
that
was
too
slow
.

The
machine
began
shipping
at
the
end
of
last
year
.

The
closely
held
company
has
n't
disclosed
sales
.

However
,
most
universities
that
have
bought
the
machines
say
they
are
buying
small
numbers
for
evaluation
purposes
.

Universities
can
now
buy
a
Next
computer
without
an
optical
storage
device
for
$
4,995
.

A
computer
with
the
optical
device
will
still
cost
$
6,495
,
but
from
now
on
Next
will
outfit
every
computer
with
a
hard
drive
and
supply
one
at
no
cost
to
those
who
have
already
bought
Next
machines
.

Commercial
customers
can
purchase
the
same
system
through
Businessland
Inc.
,
a
computer
retailer
based
in
San
Jose
,
Calif.
,
for
roughly
$
3,000
more
.

Mr.
Jobs
said
the
changes
were
prompted
by
requests
from
customers
who
are
frustrated
with
the
performance
of
the
optical
device
,
which
is
n't
offered
as
standard
equipment
by
any
rivals
.

Another
factor
was
that
customers
were
asking
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
give
us
a
cheaper
system
?
''
Mr.
Jobs
said
at
a
conference
on
university
computing
here
.

Optical-storage
devices
can
handle
very
large
amounts
of
data
and
make
it
far
easier
to
edit
film
clips
or
audio
recordings
with
a
computer
.

But
the
technology
,
while
reliable
,
is
far
slower
than
the
widely
used
hard
drives
.

To
get
around
the
delays
caused
by
the
optical
device
,
Businessland
,
which
is
Next
's
exclusive
dealer
to
corporations
,
has
for
months
been
advising
customers
to
purchase
hard
drives
with
the
machines
.

Next
's
decision
to
rely
on
the
more-established
hard
drive
in
every
Next
computer
does
n't
signal
a
retreat
from
optical
storage
,
said
Mr.
Jobs
,
who
for
years
has
said
this
technology
will
play
a
crucial
role
in
the
next
decade
.

``
We
're
extremely
committed
to
optical
storage
technology
''
he
said
.

``
We
think
everything
will
go
this
way
in
a
few
years
.

''
He
said
that
the
next
generation
of
optical
drives
will
be
as
fast
as
hard
drives
,
but
he
depends
on
outside
suppliers
for
the
devices
.

But
university
computer
specialists
,
who
welcomed
the
move
,
called
it
a
necessary
retreat
from
the
cutting
edge
of
technology
and
one
that
's
likely
to
increase
Next
's
sales
on
campuses
.

``
From
the
standpoint
of
being
on
the
forefront
of
technology
,
this
is
a
step
backward
,
''
said
Jerry
W.
Sprecher
,
a
senior
computing
manager
for
the
California
state
university
system
.

``
But
it
will
definitely
boost
Next
's
sales
.

''
Universities
,
however
,
say
Next
's
prices
must
go
even
lower
before
large
numbers
of
students
purchase
the
machine
.

``
We
'd
still
like
to
see
a
student
model
,
''
priced
at
about
$
3,500
,
said
Ronald
Johnson
,
director
of
academic
computing
at
Minnesota
's
Gustavus
Adolphus
College
,
which
has
bought
eight
Next
machines
.

Broad
acceptance
of
Next
's
computer
also
is
hindered
by
difficulty
in
distributing
software
for
it
.

Most
software
is
distributed
on
cheap
floppy
disks
,
but
the
Next
computer
does
n't
come
with
a
device
that
reads
them
.

Next
's
computer
also
needs
more
software
applications
,
but
Mr.
Jobs
said
he
expects
more
soon
.

He
said
he
expects
Lotus
Development
Corp.
to
introduce
a
Next
version
of
its
popular
1-2-3
spreadsheet
program
in
1990
.

Educators
added
that
Next
needs
to
soon
offer
a
color
version
of
its
computer
.

Every
major
maker
offers
computers
with
color
displays
.

Next
wo
n't
comment
on
when
it
will
do
the
same
,
but
is
believed
to
have
a
color
model
under
development
.

Donald
J.
Amaral
,
37
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
this
owner
and
operator
of

,
nursing
centers
and
retirement
hotels
.

He
succeeds
as
president
,
Don

,
who
remains
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
.

The
position
of
chief
operating
officer
is
new
.

Ashton-Tate
Corp.
reported
a
net
loss
of
$
19.4
million
,
or
74
cents
a
share
,
for
the
third
quarter
,
which
was
burdened
by
severance
costs
and
the
expense
of
upgrading
its
database
software
inventories
.

The
software
company
said
revenue
slid
28
%
to
$
53.9
million
.

This
contrasts
with
the
year-ago
quarter
,
when
the
company
had
net
income
of
$
11.7
million
,
or
45
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
75.7
million
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Ashton-Tate
had
a
loss
of
$
27.6
million
,
or
$
1.05
a
share
.

In
the
year-ago
period
,
the
company
had
profit
of
$
34.3
million
,
or
$
1.32
a
share
.

Revenue
in
the
period
slid
almost
8
%
to
$
203.2
million
from
about
$
220
million
last
year
.

Edward
M.
Esber
,
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
attributed
the
decline
to
reduced
domestic
revenue
because
of
$
4.9
million
spent
to
upgrade
existing
software
inventories
to
the
new
database
IV
Version
1.1
,
and
$
1.8
million
spent
on
the
recent
reduction
in
work
force
.

He
said
the
company
was
``
encouraged
by
feedback
''
it
received
from
selected
customers
now
testing
Version
1.1
.

The
red
ink
came
as
no
surprise
to
Wall
Street
,
but
analysts
said
they
saw
ominous
hints
of
a
further
delay
in
volume
shipments
of
Version
1.1
,
a
harbinger
of
continued
losses
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

``
The
loss
is
in
line
with
our
expectations
,
''
said
John
C.
Maxwell
III
,
an
analyst
with
Dillon
,
Read
&
Co.
in
New
York
.

He
added
gross
margins
and
operating
profit
``
eroded
quite
dramatically
''
from
the
prior
quarter
,
along
with
sales
of
existing
software
product
lines
like
Multimate
and
Framework
.

``
The
success
of
a
new
product
in
the
database
line
is
needed
.

And
while
the
company
has
n't
made
a
definite
statement
,
it
now
looks
like
that
's
not
going
to
be
anytime
soon
,
''
Mr.
Maxwell
said
.

The
company
said
in
a
statement
that
it
expects
to
ship
new
products
``
during
the
next
two
quarters
.

''
``
It
now
looks
like
database
IV
Version
1.1
is
n't
going
to
be
{
widely
}
available
until
the
first
quarter
of
1990
,
''
said
David
Bayer
,
an
analyst
with
Montgomery
Securities
in
San
Francisco
.

``
This
is
the
second
delay
now
in
getting
the
product
out
the
door
.

It
does
prolong
the
pain
somewhat
.

''
Mr.
Maxwell
said
unless
the
company
can
start
shipments
of
the
new
product
sometime
this
quarter
,
the
fourth-quarter
loss
is
likely
to
be
``
comparable
to
the
third
quarter
's
.

''
If
the
company
can
start
to
ship
during
this
quarter
,
it
could
stem
some
,
if
not
all
of
the
red
ink
,
he
said
.

Enserch
Corp.
said
about
12
million
,
or
93
%
,
of
the
publicly
traded
units
of
its
limited
partnership
,
Enserch
Exploration
Partners
Ltd.
,
were
tendered
in
response
to
an
offer
that
expired
Monday
.

Enserch
said
the
tendered
units
will
raise
its
ownership
of
the
partnership
to
more
than
99
%
from
87
%
.

About
900,000
units
will
continue
to
be
publicly
traded
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Enserch
said
.

Enserch
had
offered
one-half
a

of
its
common

$

for
each

The
public
sector
borrowing
requirement
,
the
most
widely
used
measure
of
Britain
's
government
deficit
or
surplus
,
showed
a
deficit
of
#
200
million
in
September
,
compared
with
a
deficit
of
#
765
million
in
August
and
a
deficit
of
#
1.08
billion
in
September
1988
,
the
Treasury
said
.

In
the
six
months
since
the
current
fiscal
year
began
April
1
,
the
surplus
totaled
#
500
million
,
compared
with
a
surplus
of
#
3.6
billion
in
the
year-earlier
period
.

The
government
is
projecting
a
#
14
billion
surplus
for
the
fiscal
year
.

The
reported
figures
for
the
public
sector
borrowing
requirement
include
receipts
from
the
sale
of
state-owned
industries
.

Excluding
those
receipts
,
the
government
deficit
would
have
totaled
about
#
2.5
billion
in
the
first
six
months
,
compared
with
#
1.3
billion
a
year
earlier
,
the
Treasury
said
.

French
crude-steel

,
unchanged
from
a
year
earlier
,
according
to
the
National
Steel
Manufacturers
'
Association
.

The
association
said
the
September
total
brought
French
output
for
the
first
nine
months
this
year
to
14,789,000

,
up
4.5

Prospect
Group
Inc.
,
whose
recent
hostile
tender
offer
for
Recognition
Equipment
Inc.
failed
for
lack
of
financing
,
apparently
has
gained
a
measure
of
control
over
the
troubled
company
anyway
.

As
part
of
what
a
Recognition
spokeswoman
termed
an
``
amiable
agreement
,
''
Prospect
Group
will
wind
up
with
control
of
top
management
posts
and
an
increased
stake
in
the
maker
of
data
management
equipment
.

In
a
management
restructuring
,
Thomas
L.
Ringer
resigned
as
chairman
,
chief
executive
and
a
director
,
while
Israel
Sheinberg
resigned
as
a
director
.

Mr.
Sheinberg
remains
as
executive
vice
president
.

Thomas
M.
Hurley
and
Robert
A.
Vanourek
,
who
had
been
designated
to
take
over
Recognition
's
top
spots
had
Prospect
's
tender
offer
succeeded
,
were
named
co-chief
executives
and
directors
.

Mr.
Hurley
was
formerly
a
vice
president
and
general
manager
of
an
Avery
International
division
;
Mr.
Vanourek
was
a
former
group
vice
president
of
Pitney
Bowes
Inc
.

In
addition
,
the
agreement
calls
for
Gilbert
H.
Lamphere
,
chairman
of
Prospect
Group
's
executive
committee
,
to
be
named
chairman
of
a
restructured
board
that
will
include
four
new
independent
directors
.

Also
named
to
the
revised
board
was
Thomas
A.
Loose
,
Recognition
's
senior
vice
president
and
general
counsel
.

Prospect
,
a
New
York-based
leveraged
buy-out
firm
,
also
agreed
to
invest
$
15
million
in
Recognition
,
which
in
turn
agreed
to
repurchase
as
much
as
$
20
million
of
its
stock
.

That
would
increase
Prospect
's
ownership
of
the
company
's
fully-diluted
shares
outstanding
to
20
%
from
14.1
%
.

Under
the
agreement
,
Prospect
is
permitted
to
increase
its
stake
in
Recognition
to
30
%
.

Beyond
that
,
Prospect
said
it
would
n't
offer
to
acquire
additional
shares
for
less
than
$
11.25
a
share
during
the
next
year
or
less
than
$
14.06
a
share
during
the
subsequent
two
years
.

Recognition
also
said
it
obtained
a
commitment
from
Chemical
Bank
and
Bank
of
Boston
to
convert
an
estimated
$
18
million
in
bank
debt
to
a
new
,
24-month
secured
term
loan
to
be
repaid
through
the
sale
of
certain
assets
.

In
August
,
Recognition
said
it
was
in
violation
of
certain
terms
of
its
debt
agreements
with
bank
lenders
because
of
a
$
3.9
million
loss
for
the
third
quarter
ended
July
31
.

The
company
attributed
the
loss
to
declining
revenue
and
litigation
costs
relating
to
criminal
charges
against
the
company
and
two
former
executives
,
William
G.
Moore
Jr.
and
Robert
W.
Reedy
.

The
former
executives
were
indicted
last
October
on
charges
of
fraud
,
theft
and
conspiracy
related
to
efforts
by
the
company
to
win
$
400
million
in
Postal
Service
contracts
.

Recognition
Equipment
said
it
expected
to
put
the
agreement
with
Prospect
to
a
vote
of
its
stockholders
at
a
special
meeting
in
January
.

In
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
,
Recognition
rose
87.5
cents
to
$
6.625
.

Prospect
slipped
25
cents
to
$
10.50
in
national
over-the-counter
trading

General
Motors
Corp.
's
Chevrolet
division
,
reacting
to
slow
sales
,
said
it
will
offer
$
800
rebates
on
its
1990
Beretta
,
the
two-door
version
of
its
core
compact-car
line
.

Sluggish
sales
of
the
Beretta
,
and
its
four-door
sister
car
,
the
Corsica
,
prompted
GM
to
idle
the
two
plants
that
build
the
automobiles
for
a
total
of
three
weeks
this
month
.

The
Corsica
and
Beretta
make
up
the
highest-volume
car
line
at
Chevrolet
,
but
sales
of
the
vehicles
are
off
9.6
%
for
the
year
,
and
fell
a
steep
34
%
during
early
October
.

Chevrolet
already
is
offering
an
$
800
rebate
on
the
1990-model
Corsica
.

The
latest
rebate
is
good
for
all
Beretta
models
.

Chevrolet
buyers
can
take
the
rebate
,
or
get
discount
financing
at
rates
ranging
from
6.9
%
on
24-month
loans
to
10.9
%
on
60-month
loans

StatesWest
Airlines
said
it
submitted
an
offer
to
the
directors
of
Mesa
Airlines
to
acquire
the
Farmington
,
N.M.
,
carrier
.

Except
to
characterize
its
offer
as
``
fair
and
generous
and
in
the
best
interests
of
Mesa
shareholders
,
''
StatesWest
declined
to
discuss
details
of
its
proposal
.

It
also
asked
Mesa
to
keep
the
proposal
confidential
.

A
Mesa
official
confirmed
receipt
of
the
offer
and
said
directors
would
meet
to
consider
it
.

Last
week
,
Mesa
rejected
a
proposal
by
StatesWest
to
acquire
it
or
merge
.

StatesWest
has
a
7.25
%
stake
in
Mesa
,
which
operates
20
twin-engine
and
two
single-engine
turboprops
among
42
cities
in
New
Mexico
,
Arizona
,
Wyoming
,
Colorado
and
Texas
.

StatesWest
operates
four
twin-engine
turboprop
aircraft
,
connecting
10
cities
in
California
,
Arizona
and
Nevada
.

The
carrier
has
n't
yet
turned
a
profit

The
former
president
of
FirstSouth
F.A.
,
a
defunct
Arkansas
thrift
,
pleaded
guilty
to
conspiring
to
inflate
the
institution
's
earnings
by
concealing
worthless
loan
guarantees
.

Roderick
D.
Reed
III
,
who
was
also
chief
operating
officer
of
FirstSouth
,
could
receive
a
maximum
sentence
of
five
years
in
federal
prison
and
a
$
250,000
fine
.

A
sentencing
date
has
n't
been
set
.

Mr.
Reed
admitted
he
conspired
to
conceal
an
agreement
not
to
enforce
loan
guarantees
executed
by
Dallas
real-estate
developers
A.
Starke
Taylor
III
and
George
S.
Watson
,
both
of
whom
were
FirstSouth
stockholders
.

Neither
Mr.
Taylor
nor
Mr.
Watson
have
been
charged
with
criminal
wrongdoing
.

By
concealing
the
non-enforcement
agreement
,
certain
transactions
with
Messrs.
Taylor
and
Watson
were
entered
on
FirstSouth
's
books
as
loans
,
allowing
the
thrift
to
report
fees
and
interest
as
current
income
,
according
to
the
U.S.
attorney
's
office
in
Little
Rock
,
Ark
.

The
conspiracy
was
part
of
an
effort
by
Mr.
Reed
to
hide
FirstSouth
's
shaky
financial
condition
from
federal
regulators
,
according
to
federal
prosecutors
and
regulators
.

The
$
1.68
billion
thrift
was
declared
insolvent
and
closed
in
December
1986
.

FirstSouth
's
former
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
Howard
Weichern
,
is
also
charged
with
conspiring
to
conceal
the
agreements
with
Messrs.
Watson
and
Taylor
.

Mr.
Weichern
is
scheduled
for
trial
Jan.
3
before
federal
Judge
Stephen
Reasoner
of
Little
Rock
.

I
approached
``
Mastergate
,
''
Larry
Gelbart
's
new
comedy
at
the
Criterion
Center
,
with
considerable
trepidation
.

Nothing
,
I
assumed
,
would
be
more
hopelessly
dated
than
a
political
satire
on
the
Iran-Contra
affair
.

I
had
underestimated
,
however
,
both
Mr.
Gelbart
's
wit
and
the
persistence
of
scandal
in
Washington
.

Though
the
play
clearly
is
framed
around
the
events
of
Iran-Contra
,
it
takes
in
the
wide
sweep
of
scandals
over
the
past
30
years
.

In
fact
,
at
one
point
Merry
Chase
(
Melinda
Mullins
)
,
a
cool
,
carefully
coiffed
television
announcer
,
recites
a
list
of
a
dozen
or
more
scandals
of
recent
years
,
concluding
with
those
affecting
the
Department
of
Housing
and
Urban
Development
and
the
savings
and
loan
industry
.

Onstage
,
a
congressional
hearing
is
in
progress
,
complete
with
elegant
crystal
chandelier
overhead
and
a
lifesize
reproduction
of
the
signing
of
the
Constitution
in
the
background
.

The
witness
table
is
center
stage
and
below
it
,
the
paraphernalia
for
the
ever-present
media
,
in
this
case
TNN
,
the
Total
News
Network
.

Not
only
are
there
camera
operators
on
all
sides
,
but
the
proceedings
are
shown
on
monitors
throughout
the
theater
.

The
metaphor
of
theater
is
not
entirely
coincidental
.

Mr.
Gelbart
clearly
feels
that
all
the
participants
in
a
congressional
hearing
--
the
witnesses
,
the
lawyers
,
the
interrogators
and
the
news
media
--
are
performers
.

As
the
story
of
``
Mastergate
''
unfolds
,
we
learn
that
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
confiscated
one
of
the
properties
of
a
foreign
financier
who
owes
the
government
millions
in
taxes
.

The
man
,
it
seems
,
has
a
Lichtenstein
corporation
,
licensed
in
Libya
and
sheltered
in
the
Bahamas
.

He
himself
lives
in
a
``
consecutive
series
of
unnumbered
houses
in
a
town
in
Switzerland
.

''
The
property
seized
by
the
IRS
is
a
Hollywood
film
studio
,
Master
Pictures
Incorporated
(
MPI
)
.

Supposedly
the
IRS
will
sell
off
the
assets
of
MPI
,
but
before
it
can
,
a
lowly
IRS
agent
is
called
into
the
hospital
room
of
Wylie
Slaughter
,
the
dying
head
of
the
Central
Intelligence
Agency
.

The
lowly
agent
,
Abel
Lamb
,
who
as
you
might
guess
,
is
being
led
to
the
slaughter
,
is
ordered
to
take
over
the
studio
.

Soon
the
studio
is
producing
a
$
40
million
picture
called
``
Tet
,
the
Motion
Picture
,
''
to
distinguish
it
from
``
Tet
,
the
Offensive
,
''
as
well
as
``
Tet
,
the
Book
''
and
``
Tet
,
the
Album
.

''
The
picture
,
to
be
made
in
the
Central
American
country
of
San
Elvador
,
is
a
cover
for
sending
$
800
million
of
arms
to
Los
Otros
,
the
rebel
group
attempting
to
regain
neighboring
Ambigua
,
which
has
been
taken
over
by
the
leftist
dictator
Dr.
Overtega
,
a
former
podiatrist
,
who
leads
a
revolutionary
band
of
foot
soldiers
.

The
man
handling
all
this
for
the
now-deceased
Slaughter
is
Major
Manley
Battle
,
Mr.
Gelbart
's
stand
in
for
Col.
Oliver
North
.

Director
Michael
Engler
has
assembled
a
top-flight
cast
to
carry
out
the
impersonations
of
well-known
political
figures
and
to
play
the
stock
characters
who
invariably
show
up
at
congressional
hearings
.

Daniel
von
Bargen
is
ramrod-stiff
but
totally
assured
as
Major
Battle
,
mixing
just
the
right
brand
of
self-righteousness
and
patriotism
;
Jeff
Weiss
is
fire
,
brimstone
and
teary-eyed
emotionalism
as
the
far-right
senator
who
serves
as
a
friendly
interrogator
of
Major
Battle
;
Zach
Grenier
is
maddeningly
officious
playing
a
succession
of
lawyers
;
Joseph
Daly
has
the
perfect
``
aw
,
shucks
''
demeanor
of
George
Bush
in
his
portrayal
of
the
vice
president
;
and
Ann
McDonough
is
first-rate
as
a
succession
of
witnesses
'
wives
.

With
one
she
is
pregnant
,
with
Major
Battle
she
is
knitting
an
American
flag
,
and
as
the
vice
president
's
wife
she
rushes
in
with
white
hair
,
wearing
a
tailored
suit
and
pearls
,
imitating
Barbara
Bush
's
gestures
down
to
the
last
detail
.

Though
it
's
clear
that
Mr.
Gelbart
's
sympathies
do
not
lie
with
the
far
right
,
it
's
also
true
that
he
is
evenhanded
in
dispensing
his
satirical
jabs
,
taking
sharp
aim
at
senators
and
congressmen
of
all
stripes
and
particularly
at
the
media
.

Mr.
Gelbart
also
has
fun
with
language
.

``
Mastergate
''
is
subtitled
``
a
play
on
words
,
''
and
Mr.
Gelbart
plays
that
game
as
well
as
anyone
.

He
describes
a
Mastergate
flunky
as
one
who
experienced
a
``
meteoric
disappearance
''
and
found
himself
``
handling
blanket
appeals
at
the
Bureau
of
Indian
Affairs
.

''
This
interest
in
words
goes
beyond
puns
and
playfulness
,
however
.

Mr.
Gelbart
deplores
the
obfuscation
,
the
circumlocution
and
the
debasement
of
language
he
sees
on
all
sides
.

As
the
hearings
begin
,
the
self-important
Sen.
Bowman
(
Jerome
Kilty
)
announces
:
``
Let
me
emphaticize
one
thing
at
the
outset
:
We
are
not
looking
for
hides
to
skin
nor
goats
to
scape
.

''
Major
Battle
himself
speaks
in
pure
Pentagonese
:
``
Without
further
monetary-stroke-military
aid
,
scores
of
Ambiguan
freedom
lovers
,
who
had
gone
way
out
on
their
life
and
limbs
for
us
,
were
literally
cut
off
at
the
knees
without
a
paddle
.

''
At
another
point
he
intones
:
``
Publicity
is
a
small
price
to
pay
for
secrecy
.

''
The
evening
is
short
--
95
minutes
without
an
intermission
--
but
even
so
,
as
the
play
progresses
the
thrust
of
Mr.
Gelbart
's
satire
loses
its
sharpness
as
his
targets
pop
up
ever
more
predictably
.

Most
of
the
evening
,
though
,
is
filled
with
rare
and
welcome
wit
.

In
``
Mastergate
,
''
Mr.
Gelbart
has
provided
us
not
just
one
but
two
commodities
that
have
all
but
disappeared
from
the
Broadway
theater
:
sharp
political
satire
and
an
even
sharper
appreciation
of
the
value
of
language
.

The
Federal
National

up

``
The
New
Crowd

Judith
Ramsey
Ehrlich
and
Barry
J.
Rehfeld
(
Little
,

,
444
pages
,

)
,
describes
the
displacing
of
the
old
``
our
crowd
''
Jewish
Wall
Street
banking
grandees
by
such
new
business
barons
as
Saul
Steinberg
,
Carl
Icahn
,
Sanford
Weill
and
Bruce
Wasserstein
.

Its
many
lively
stories
include
the
Gutfreund-Postel
holiday
cheer
imbroglio
.

These
two
New
Crowd
families
lived
in
the
same
apartment
building
,
with
the
Postel
penthouse
perched
on
top
of
the
Gutfreund
duplex
.

The
penthouse
elevator
started
up
from
the
Gutfreund
landing
,
and
Susan
Gutfreund
used
to
turn
off
its
light
,
to
give
the
impression
that
there
was
no
higher
floor
.

Eventually
,
Mr.
Postel
broke
his
toe
in
the
dark
.

Then
the
Gutfreunds
determined
to
put
up
a
22-foot
Christmas
tree
,
weighing
a
quarter
of
a
ton
,
to
amaze
their
holiday
guests
.

For
this
,
a
crane
needed
to
be
mounted
on
the
Postels
'
terrace
.

The
Postels
did
not
give
permission
.

But
the
Gutfreund
workers
went
ahead
anyway
,
only
to
be
captured
``
in
flagrante
''
by
Joan
Postel
,
who
called
the
police
.

Before
the
Gutfreunds
finally
left
this
unfriendly
environment
for
a
prodigious
duplex
on
Fifth
Avenue
and
an
18th-century
mansion
with
a
specially
excavated
$
1
million
garage
in
Paris
,
the
Postels
had
obtained
an
injunction
to
prevent
any
future
hoisting
of
trees
,
and
in
a
neighborly
spirit
hit
both
the
Gutfreunds
and
the
building
with
a
$
35
million
lawsuit
.

Nothing
less
,
it
seemed
,
could
console
them
for
their
traumas
.

Where
had
all
the
money
come
from
?
The
young
John
Gutfreund
had
been
discovered
by
Billy
Salomon
of
Salomon
Bros.
when
he
was
still
a
bearded
liberal
,
and
put
to
work
as
a
trader
,
and
then
as
a
rough-and-tumble
syndicator
.

``
`
Get
off
your
...
,
'
he
would
bellow
,
''
say
the
authors
.

Rising
in
the
firm
,
he
became
powerful
and
bland
,
though
his
new
wife
,
Susan
,
made
him
shine
in
the
gossip
columns
with
her
profligate
spending
habits
and
flamboyant
frocks
.

After
he
had
been
head
of
the
company
for
3
years
,
he
and
his
partners
sold
it
to
Phibro
,
a
powerful
commodity
trading
outfit
,
for
$
550
million
in
Phibro
stock
.

Limited
partner
Billy
Salomon
,
whose
family
name
had
been
on
the
firm
's
door
for
70
years
and
who
had
hoped
it
would
be
there
forever
,
was
not
consulted
.

Mr.
Gutfreund
collected
$
32
million
,
while
Billy
Salomon
got
$
10
million
,
much
less
than
if
he
had
conducted
the
sale
.

``
I
felt
betrayed
,
''
he
later
said
.

Worse
,
Salomon
's
timing
had
been
off
.

Its
profits
,
unlike
Phibro
's
,
soared
over
the
next
two
years
,
and
had
it
held
out
,
Salomon
could
have
gotten
an
even
bigger
bundle
.

The
book
also
recounts
the
not
dissimilar
maneuvers
surrounding
the
changing
of
the
guard
at
Lehman
Bros.
and
other
grand
old
firms
.

Often
the
genteel
,
conservative
,
long-term-oriented
investment
bankers
were
displaced
by
crude
traders
:
``
When
angered
,
he
cursed
so
forcefully
that
his
face
reddened
and
his
pale-blue
eyes
narrowed
into
tiny
slits
,
''
the
authors
say
of
Lehman
's
Lewis
Glucksman
.

The
earlier
generation
of
``
our
crowd
''
bankers
--
Belmonts
,
Warburgs
,
Lehmans
,
Baches
and
Schiffs
--
had
stressed
above
all
probity
,
tradition
,
continuity
and
reputation
.

They
were
old-fashioned
elegant
gentlemen
,
who
happened
to
be
of
German
Jewish
extraction
.

But
in
the
harsh
world
of
today
's
Wall
Street
they
have
lost
out
to
more
aggressive
and
sometimes
less
scrupulous
successors
.

The
cuckoo
prefers
the
nests
of
other
birds
and
heaves
out
their
eggs
.

But
the
old
guard
hired
the
New
Crowd
people
:
It
brought
in
its
own
cuckoos
.

So
,
as
the
Old
Crowd
toppled
from
the
branch
,
it
should
n't
have
been
too
surprised
.

The
old
guard
had
every
right
,
however
,
to
disdain
the
newcomers
'
new
ways
of
making
money
,
such
as
greenmail
.

(
A
Fortune
article
on
Saul
Steinberg
was
entitled
,
``
Fear
and
Loathing
in
the
Corporate
Boardrooms
.

''
)
Their
other
staple
has
been
corporate
takeovers
,
often
hostile
and
financed
by
junk
bonds
.

Hostile
takeovers
are
quite
a
new
phenomenon
.

Sometimes
they
are
constructive
,
but
often
not
.

First
,
by
making
management
focus
on
short-term
results
,
they
inhibit
building
for
the
future
--
just
the
opposite
of
Japan
.

Second
,
a
long-term
shareholder
of
a
good
company
need
n't
worry
too
much
when
the
stock
price
drops
temporarily
:
It
will
bounce
back
.

But
if
a
raider
takes
over
when
the
stock
is
weak
,
the
shareholder
never
gets
his
recovery
.

The
raiders
,
meanwhile
,
have
evolved
their
own
pattern
for
spending
their
new
millions
.

As
described
in
``
The
New
Crowd
,
''
they
take
on
ambitious
new
wives
,
move
to
Greenwich
,
Conn.
,
or
Bedford
,
N.Y.
,
buy
OK
pictures
,
and
let
their
wives
share
the
wealth
with
decorators
.

Having
donated
heavily
to
museums
,
they
demand
a
place
on
their
boards
.

The
book
is
patronizing
about
this
nouveau
riche
struggle
for
respectability
,
which
has
its
tawdry
aspects
.

However
,
on
balance
,
the
charity
game
helps
America
.

If
those
who
have
the
money
do
n't
get
involved
with
the
museums
and
the
charities
,
then
City
Hall
will
do
it
,
badly
.

It
has
been
rightly
observed
that
the
main
thing
wrong
with
tainted
money
is
,
t'
ai
nt
enough
of
it
.

A
handful
of
the
New
Crowd
operators
have
crossed
the
line
from
the
immoral
to
the
illegal
,
and
have
ended
up
in
the
slammer
or
paying
huge
fines
:
Ivan
Boesky
,
Dennis
Levine
,
Martin
Siegel
,
Victor
and
Steven
Posner
,
and
now
Michael
Milken
and
perhaps
Leona
Helmsley
.

The
glitzy
office
that
Ivan
Boesky
vacated
for
a
prison
cell
had
previously
contained
commodity
operators
Marc
Rich
and
``
Pinky
''
Green
,
today
fugitives
from
a
potential
century
apiece
of
jail
sentences
.

The
Old
Crowd
is
deeply
concerned
by
the
backlash
from
all
this
.

However
,
the
phenomenon
is
not
specifically
Jewish
.

It
has
always
been
true
that
those
outside
the
club
want
to
climb
in
,
and
that
a
few
will
cut
corners
in
the
process
.

Some
pretty
seamy
stuff
built
the
turn-of-the-century
families
'
Fifth
Avenue
and
Newport
palazzi
and
endowed
their
daughters
'
weddings
to
foreign
noblemen
.

Mr.
Boesky
was
a
piker
compared
to
Jay
Gould
and
Jim
Fiske
,
and
Commodore
Vanderbilt
thought
nothing
of
bribing
judges
and
legislators
.

So
who
knows
?
In
a
generation
or
two
some
of
the
New
Crowd
may
attain
true
respectability
,
perhaps
to
be
displaced
in
turn
by
a
later
flock
of
unscrupulous
raptors
.

Or
perhaps
Wall
Street
,
when
it
has
suffered
enough
,
will
realize
that
finance
is
a
service
industry
,
and
change
its
ethos
.

Dallas
investor
Harold
C.
Simmons
said
he
raised
his
stake
in
Lockheed
Corp.
to
10.62
%
from
10.43
%
of
the
aerospace
and
electronics
concern
's
common
shares
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
Mr.
Simmons
said
he
and
companies
he
controls
,
NL
Industries
Inc.
and
NL
Chemicals
Inc.
,
hold
6,744,600
shares
of
Lockheed
,
of
Calabasas
,
Calif
.

They
include
122,700
shares
bought
Friday
for
between
$
47.125
and
$
48
each
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
Lockheed
closed
at
$
46.125
a
share
,
down
12.5
cents
.

Earlier
this
week
,
Mr.
Simmons
objected
to
published
reports
quoting
him
as
saying
he
planned
to
sell
his
Lockheed
stake
because
``
the
defense
industry
seems
to
be
getting
more
uncertain
.

''
Valhi
Inc.
,
another
of
Mr.
Simmons
'
companies
,
responded
to
an
article
Monday
in
The
Wall
Street
Journal
,
which
credited
a
story
in
the
Sunday
Los
Angeles
Daily
News
.

Valhi
said
the
articles
did
n't
accurately
reflect
Valhi
and
its
affiliates
'
intentions
toward
Lockheed
.

Instead
,
Valhi
said
,
they
may
increase
,
decrease
or
retain
their
Lockheed
holdings
,
depending
on
a
number
of
conditions
.

Canada
,
which
is
preparing
to
speed
up
tariff
cuts
with
the
U.S.
,
recorded
a
47
%
narrowing
in
its
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
in
August
,
Statistics
Canada
,
a
federal
agency
,
reported
.

U.S.
exports
to
Canada
jumped
11.2
%
in
August
from
July
while
U.S.
imports
from
Canada
rose
only
2.7
%
.

As
a
result
,
Canada
's
trade
surplus
with
the
U.S.
narrowed
to
C$
656.5
million
(
US$
558
million
)
in
August
from
C$
1.23
billion
(
US$
1.04
billion
)
in
July
.

U.S.
exports
benefited
in
August
from
heavy
Canadian
spending
on
new
plant
and
equipment
and
a
pickup
in
Canadian
auto
demand
,
Canadian
officials
said
.

The
U.S.
and
Canada
,
which
do
more
trade
than
any
other
pair
of
nations
,
are
to
meet
next
month
to
arrange
an
acceleration
of
planned
tariff
cuts
under
the
U.S.-Canada
free
trade
agreement
.

Industries
in
both
countries
have
requested
a
speedup
of
tariff
cuts
on
hundreds
of
products
.

Some
tariffs
were
eliminated
when
the
trade
pact
took
effect
Jan.
1
.

The
remainder
were
to
be
phased
out
in
five
or
10
annual
installments
,
with
all
tariffs
eliminated
by
January
1998
.

The
two
countries
aim
to
reach
an
agreement
by
early
December
on
a
package
of
accelerated
tariff
cuts
that
would
take
effect
early
next
year
.

Canadian
officials
said
the
trade
pact
has
kindled
an
export
interest
among
many
small
Canadian
companies
that
previously
had
little
or
no
foreign
sales
.

For
such
businessmen
,
the
Canadian
government
is
organizing
55
missions
this
year
to
U.S.
states
bordering
on
Canada
.

The
businessmen
are
introduced
to
potential
agents
and
distributors
and
instructed
in
trade
procedures
.

The
U.S.
Commerce
Department
is
planning
to
try
out
similar
trips
on
U.S.
businessmen
in
coming
months
under
its
Canada
First
!
Outreach
Program
.

Participants
in
the
U.S.
missions
to
Canada
are
to
be
assisted
by
members
of
the
Service
Corps
of
Retired
Executives
,
a
volunteer
group
,
in
dealing
with
their
export
challenges
.

The
Canadian
government
also
has
recently
opened
new
trade
offices
in
San
Diego
;
San
Juan
,
Puerto
Rico
;
Miami
;
Princeton
,
N.J.
,
and
Denver
,
bringing
the
total
number
of
such
Canadian
offices
in
the
U.S.
to
27
.

The
U.S.
has
six
trade
promotion
offices
in
Canada
.

Canada
's
export
effort
has
been
blunted
by
robust
home
market
demand
and
by
an
18
%
appreciation
of
the
Canadian
dollar
against
its
U.S.
counterpart
in
the
past
three
years
that
has
made
Canadian
goods
more
costly
in
the
U.S
.

Canada
's
trade
surplus
with
all
countries
narrowed
to
C$
203.5
million
in
August
from
C$
528.3
million
in
July
,
Statistics
Canada
said
.

Loral
Corp.
said
it
received
a
$
325
million
order
from
Turkey
's
Ministry
of
Defense
,
the
largest

the
company
ever
has
received
.

Loral
will
provide
to
Turkey
an
electronic
countermeasures
system
for
its

The
system
provides

The
defense
electronics
maker
said
delivery
will
begin
in
October
1991
and
run
through
mid-1995
.

Loral
said
the
contract
with
Turkey
will
provide
opportunities
for

to
supply
that
country
with

said
it
reached
a
definitive

Under
the
proposed
agreement
,

for
each
of
the
1.1
million
Gold
Texas

.

The
arrangement
is
subject

Crown
said
.

Gold
Texas

said
its

purchase
warrants
outstanding
.

The
expiration
date
had
been
Nov.
3
.

Each
of
the
1,075,000

to
purchase
one
share
of
Apogee

Bank
of
New
England
Corp.
,
seeking
to
streamline
its
business
after
a
year
of
weak
earnings
and
mounting
loan
problems
,
said
it
will
sell
some
operations
and
lay
off
4
%
of
its
work
force
.

The
bank
holding
company
also
reported
that
third-quarter
profit
dropped
41
%
,
to
$
42.7
million
,
or
61
cents
a

,
from
the
year-earlier
$
72.3
million
,
or
$
1.04
a

.

Among
its
restructuring
measures
,
the
company
said
it
plans
to
sell
53
of
its
453
branch
offices
and
to
lay
off
800
employees
.

Altogether
,
employment
is
expected
to
decline
to
less
than
16,000
from
the
current
level
of
about
18,000
.

Walter
Connolly
,
chairman
,
said
in
an
interview
that
the
company
expects
to
record
pretax
gains
of
$
100
million
to
$
125
million
from
the
sale
of
its
leasing
operations
and
of
certain
financial
processing
services
.

In
a
prepared
statement
,
the
company
said
it
expects
to
realize
those
gains
before
year
end
.

Nonperforming
assets
continued
to
pile
up
in
the
latest
quarter
,
rising
to
$
900
million
,
or
3.52
%
of
loans
and
leases
,
from
$
667
million
,
or
2.68
%
,
at
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
.

Some
$
170
million
of
the
$
233
million
increase
in
nonperforming
loans
was
related
to
real
estate
,
and
roughly
three-quarters
of
that
was
in
the
troubled
New
England
market
,
according
to
Richard
Driscoll
,
vice
chairman
.

Mr.
Driscoll
said
that
,
despite
continued
weakness
in
the
region
's
real
estate
market
,
Bank
of
New
England
expects
the
rate
of
increase
in
nonperforming
assets
to
slow
in
coming
quarters
.

Mr.
Connolly
noted
that
net
third-quarter
charge-offs
,
at
$
63
million
,
improved
slightly
from
the
$
67
million
in
the
second
quarter
.

And
he
indicated
that
more
substantial
improvement
is
expected
in
the
next
couple
of
quarters
.

The
company
increased
its
loan
loss
reserve
to
$
354
million
from
$
342
million
at
the
end
of
the
second
quarter
.

Total
assets
slipped
to
$
31.4
billion
,
from
$
32
billion
as
of
June
30
.

Among
other
restructuring
measures
,
the
bank
said
it
will
close
its
loan
production
offices
in
Chicago
,
New
York
and
Philadelphia
.

The
Chicago
office
figured
prominently
in
the
bank
's
problems
earlier
this
year
,
when
$
65
million
in
loans
to
Chicago
businessman
William
Stoecker
went
sour
.

In
an
internal
memorandum
to
employees
,
Messrs.
Connolly
and
Driscoll
described
the
restructuring
as
an
effort
to
continue
rationalizing
operations
assembled
during
a
series
of
mergers
over
the
past
five
years
.

Italy
's
wholesale
price
index
rose
0.4
%
in
August
from
July
and
was
up
6.1
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
the
state
statistical
institute
reported
.

The
index
registered
196.1
in
August
,
compared
with
195.4
in
July
and
with
184.9
in
August
1988
.

The
year-on-year
rise
in
August
was
slightly
down
from
the
6.4
%
rate
in
July
.

The
index
has
a
base
of
100
set
in
1980
and
is
n't
seasonally
adjusted
.

U.S.
steel
imports
in
August
fell
14
%
from
a
year
earlier
to
1,531,000
tons
,
according
to
the
American
Iron
and
Steel
Institute
.

The
trade
group
's
compilation
of
Commerce
Department
data
showed
that
August
imports
,
the
second
largest
monthly
total
of
the
year
,
were
up
5
%
from
July
's
1,458,000
tons
but
below
last
year
's
high
of
1,979,000
tons
in
June
1988
.

August
imports
claimed
18.5
%
of
the
U.S.
market
,
compared
with
19.3
%
in
July
and
20.5
%
in
August
1988
.

The
latest
month
's
figures
show
that
imports
of
steel
from
European
Community
nations
fell
to
466,000
tons
from
481,000
a
month
earlier
,
while
imports
from
Japan
rose
to
323,000
tons
from
288,000
in
July
.

Imports
from
Canada
rose
to
272,000
tons
in
August
from
209,000
in
July
.

The
American
Institute
for
Imported
Steel
said
imports
for
the
first
eight
months
of
1989
were
below
the
level
allowed
by
the
Voluntary
Restraint
Agreement
program
.

The
institute
said
that
,
excluding
semifinished
steel
products
,
year-to-date
imports
represented
15.2
%
of
consumption
,
compared
with
a
permitted
maximum
of
18.5
%
.

Japanese
machinery
makers
received
orders
totaling
1.465
trillion
yen
(
$
10.33
billion
)
in
August
,
up
14
%
from
a
year
earlier
,
the
Economic
Planning
Agency
said
.

``
Equipment
orders
on
the
domestic
side
were
particularly
strong
in
shipping
and
power
utilities
,
''
said
an
agency
official
.

The
latest
report
compares
with
a
modest
9.9
%
increase
in
July
machinery
orders
from
a
year
earlier
.

In
August
,
soon
after
Wang
Laboratories
Inc.
reported
a
staggering
$
424.3
million
loss
and
replaced
its
president
,
two
Boston
sales
representatives
sent
customers
a
letter
saying
:
``
We
fully
expect
that
you
will
soon
be
reading
stories
in
the
press
reporting
the
`
Amazing
Comeback
at
Wang
.

'
''
How
soon
Wang
will
stage
a
comeback
,
or
if
it
will
at
all
,
are
still
matters
of
debate
.

But
Wang
salespeople
are
trying
to
cope
with
the
biggest
challenge
any
marketer
can
face
:
selling
the
products
of
a
company
that
is
on
the
ropes
.

``
If
your
prospect
is
feeling
risk
the
whole
time
and
you
're
not
feeling
as
if
you
're
backed
up
by
a
stable
company
,
you
've
lost
it
before
you
've
begun
,
''
says
Mary
Ann
Cluggish
,
a
Wellesley
,
Mass.
,
sales
trainer
and
consultant
who
works
with
high
technology
companies
.

It
can
happen
in
any
industry
.

Consider
the
difficulties
faced
by
Audi
salespeople
when
the
car
was
tainted
by
false
charges
of
sudden
acceleration
,
or
Exxon
dealers
'
problems
in
the
wake
of
the
Valdez
oil
spill
.

Like
thousands
of
salespeople
before
them
,
Wang
's
are
finding
ways
to
combat
the
bad
news
.

``
It
's
very
important
that
we
exude
confidence
,
even
though
within
the
family
we
know
there
's
a
lot
of
hard
work
ahead
,
''
said
Richard
Miller
,
the
Lowell
,
Mass.
,
computer
concern
's
new
president
,
in
a
video
message
to
salespeople
a
month
after
he
took
over
.

Wang
got
into
financial
trouble
because
of
bloated
overhead
and
overly
optimistic
sales
forecasts
.

Its
mainline
minicomputers
and
word
processors
have
lost
ground
to
cheaper
personal
computers
.

Last
year
it
funded
its
high
employment
by
heavy
borrowing
,
and
it
suffered
huge
losses
when
sales
turned
down
instead
of
rising
.

After
the
company
reported
red
ink
for
the
fiscal
third
quarter
,
Wang
's
marketing
department
provided
the
sales
force
answers
to
questions
such
as
``
How
could
you
not
have
known
you
were
going
to
lose
$
55
million
?
''
and
``
Is
Wang
still
a
viable
company
?
''
Salespeople
try
to
push
their
products
and
avoid
discussions
of
finances
.

Responding
to
such
questions
is
``
defensive
,
''
says
Kenneth
Olissa
,
Wang
's
vice
president
,
marketing
.

``
That
's
antithetical
to
the
art
of
selling
.

''
Moreover
,
he
notes
that
analyzing
financial
results
``
poses
a
problem
for
a
salesman
who
is
n't
particularly
familiar
with
a
balance
sheet
.

''
At
one
sales
strategy
meeting
,
an
executive
suggested
ordering
salespeople
to
become
experts
on
the
annual
report
.

Mr.
Miller
vetoed
that
:
``
Even
I
ca
n't
understand
all
the
footnotes
,
''
he
says
.

Instead
,
he
says
,
if
the
salespeople
can
get
the
customers
to
consider
Wang
's
products
on
their
merits
,
he
or
a
top
financial
officer
will
try
to
assuage
the
fears
about
finances
.

Mike
Metschan
,
a
salesman
in
Wang
's
Austin
,
Texas
,
office
,
has
a
breezier
method
:
``
We
tell
them
$
3
billion
companies
do
n't
go
out
of
business
.

We
tell
them
all
the
major
companies
are
having
financial
difficulties
.

''
Numerous
computer
companies
are
having
sales
slumps
and
earnings
declines
,
but
very
few
have
had
losses
comparable
to
Wang
's
or
are
carrying
such
a
large
debt
load
.

Mr.
Miller
says
that
after
a
sharp
sales
slump
in
July
and
August
,
sales
stabilized
in
September
.

Although
Wang
will
report
a
loss
for
the
first
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
and
the
full
fiscal
year
,
Mr.
Miller
says
he
expects
the
company
will
return
to
profitability
by
the
fourth
quarter
.

Experts
on
sales
technique
say
anyone
representing
a
troubled
company
must
walk
a
fine
line
.

``
If
a
salesman
jeopardizes
his
credibility
in
this
time
of
trouble
,
it
will
be
a
problem
for
the
long
run
,
''
says
George
Palmatier
,
a
Minden
,
Nev.
,
sales
consultant
and
author
of
``
The
Marketing
Edge
.

''
Still
,
says
John
Sullivan
,
a
management
recruiter
with
Daniel
Roberts
Inc.
of
Boston
,
who
has
held
senior
sales
positions
at
Polaroid
and
Atari
:
``
The
customer
will
react
to
strength
.

Ignore
the
present
condition
.

Show
it
's
business
as
usual
.

''
That
is
n't
easy
.

Wang
's
customers
are
data
processing
managers
who
want
to
be
sure
that
their
suppliers
are
stable
,
wellrun
companies
that
will
be
around
to
fix
bugs
and
upgrade
computers
for
years
to
come
.

For
buyers
,
``
these
are
career-risking
decisions
,
''
says
Jean
Conlin
,
who
supervises
a
network
of
Wang
computers
in
the
admissions
department
at
Boston
University
.

The
university
is
considering
installing
a
$
250,000
system
to
store
applications
electronically
.

``
Before
the
really
bad
news
,
we
were
looking
at
Wang
fairly
seriously
,
''
she
says
.

But
``
their
present
financial
condition
means
I
'd
have
a
hard
time
convincing
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
purchasing
.

''
Ms.
Conlin
adds
:
``
At
some
point
we
'd
have
to
ask
,
`
How
do
we
know
that
in
three
years
you
wo
n't
be
in
Chapter
11
?
'
''
During
the
past
year
,
Wang
has
developed
new
products
and
a
new
strategy
and
hired
a
new
president
.

Wang
's
overall
product
line
is
``
still
not
as
good
as
other
vendors
,
but
they
've
come
a
long
way
,
''
says
Steven
Wendler
,
a
consultant
with
market
researcher
Gartner
Group
,
Stamford
,
Conn
.

``
They
were
on
the
road
to
recovery
in
terms
of
customer
attitudes
until
this
bad
quarter
happened
.

''
The
first
priority
for
Wang
's
sales
force
is
to
make
sure
it
holds
on
to
existing
customers
.

Wang
's
installed
base
is
one
of
its
greatest
assets
,
and
many
of
those
customers
remain
extremely
loyal
.

But
even
before
Wang
's
latest
financial
troubles
surfaced
,
some
customers
``
were
trying
to
wall
off
their
Wang
installations
''
so
other
departments
would
n't
add
Wang
,
says
Chris
Christiansen
,
a
former
Wang
marketer
who
is
now
a
market
analyst
with
Meta
Group
,
a
market
research
firm
in
Stamford
,
Conn
.

One
Wang
salesman
who
left
the
company
in
July
recalls
that
when
he
tried
to
sell
products
to
Eastman
Kodak
,
he
worked
``
to
muster
support
from
internal
allies
,
''
but
``
those
allies
became
skeptical
as
they
saw
the
downtrend
.

The
more
recent
losses
were
really
devastating
.

''
New
customers
,
the
source
of
higher
commissions
for
salespeople
and
the
key
to
Wang
's
long-term
viability
,
are
even
tougher
.

Rick
Lynch
,
a
former
top
salesman
in
Wang
's
Boston
office
,
referring
to
Wang
's
mainstay
computer
line
,
says
:
``
You
ca
n't
sell
a
VS
to
a
new
customer
.

''
Mr.
Lynch
left
Wang
this
summer
for
Oracle
Systems
Inc.
,
a
software
vendor
.

The
financial
problems
are
particularly
frustrating
for
salespeople
pushing
Wang
's
image
systems
,
which
convert
paper
forms
to
electronic
documents
.

Consultants
say
that
Wang
's
technology
is
among
the
best
available
in
the
image
market
.

But
salespeople
often
found
that
news
of
Wang
's
problems
superseded
their
sales
efforts
.

William
Tait
,
a
former
sales
manager
in
Indianapolis
,
says
that
his
office
had
all
but
sold
a
$
1.5
million
image
system
to
pharmaceutical
maker
Eli
Lilly
&
Co
.

``
When
they
were
making
the
decision
,
all
hell
broke
loose
with
the
finances
.

''
He
says
the
Lilly
executives
told
him
they
could
n't
take
the
risk
with
Wang
.

Mr.
Tait
say
he
does
n't
blame
Lilly
.

Buyers
have
to
rely
on
a
supplier
``
continually
upgrading
and
replacing
the
product
,
''
he
says
.

``
When
a
company
realizes
that
,
it
's
hard
to
go
with
Wang
.

''
For
Mr.
Tait
,
who
says
he
used
to
earn
as
much
as
$
150,000
a
year
at
Wang
,
it
was
one
more
reason
to
quit
.

He
is
now
president
of
Eastate
Homes
Inc.
,
an
Indianapolis
contractor
.

It
can
be
hard
for
a
salesperson
to
fight
off
feelings
of
discouragement
.

Brian
Petre
,
a
former
Wang
salesman
in
upstate
New
York
,
says
:
``
You
have
pride
in
your
job
.

You
think
you
can
go
out
and
turn
things
around
.

It
's
a
tough
thing
when
you
ca
n't
.

The
reason
does
n't
relate
to
your
selling
skills
.

''
Discouragement
feeds
on
itself
.

``
The
problem
is
,
if
people
get
down
in
the
dumps
,
they
stop
selling
,
''
says
Mike
Durcan
,
a
laid-off
sales
manager
in
Wang
's
Austin
office
.

One
key
for
salespeople
is
to
boost
their
own
morale
.

Paul
Hellman
,
a
Framingham
,
Mass.
,
sales
and
management
consultant
and
author
of
``
Ready
,
Aim
,
You
're
Hired
,
''
says
:
``
The
bad
news
is
,
you
'll
be
rejected
more
.

The
good
news
is
,
it
's
not
your
fault
.

''
So
,
he
advises
,
make
goals
achievable
.

For
instance
,
he
suggests
that
salespeople
making
telephone
calls
should
say
to
themselves
:
``
All
I
want
to
do
today
is
get
50
rejections
.

''
But
Mr.
Miller
,
Wang
's
new
president
,
recently
warned
his
salespeople
about
negativism
.

``
Our
customers
watch
us
for
the
hidden
message
,
''
he
said
.

``
Look
a
customer
right
in
the
eye
and
say
,
`
I
'm
glad
to
be
at
Wang
.

Blinder
International
Enterprises
Inc.
,
the
parent
of
beleaguered
penny-stockbroker
Blinder
,
Robinson
&
Co.
,
said
its
shareholders
approved
a
previously
announced
name
change
to
Intercontinental
Enterprises
Inc
.

``
The
parent
company
is
diversifying
into
other
industries
around
the
world
,
''
said
president
Meyer
Blinder
in
explaining
the
name
change
.

``
Everytime
we
talked
about
Blinder
International
,
{
people
}
thought
it
was
the
brokerage
house
.

''
Mr.
Blinder
said
the
change
was
n't
related
to
the
brokerage
's
recent
troubles
,
which
have
included
sharp
declines
in
earnings
,
run-ins
with
the
securities
regulators
and
lawsuits
by
former
customers
.

The
company
said
it
expects
the
name
change
to
take
effect
within
a
week
.

Olin
Corp.
said
third-quarter
net
income
rose
26
%
on
the
strength
of
its
chemical
business
.

Net
was
$
24
million
,
or
$
1.15
a
share
,
up
from
$
19
million
,
or
90
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
rose
7.4
%
to
$
580
million
from
$
540
million
.

Olin
said
its
chemical
segment
had
profit
of
$
22
million
,
up
from
$
15
million
a
year
ago
,
largely
because
of
gains
in
electrochemicals
such
as
caustic
soda
.

The
company
said
the
gains
were
tied
to
volume
increases
and
higher
prices
.

The
market
for
electrochemicals
include
the
paper
,
water-purification
and
textile
industries
.

The
chemical
segment
had
a
$
6
million
gain
on
the
sale
of
ammonia
and
urea
businesses
,
which
was
offset
by
a
$
6
million
charge
for
future
environmental
expenditures
.

Profit
in
Olin
's
defense
and
ammunition
segment
rose
to
$
8
million
from
$
7
million
.

The
metals
segment
,
hurt
by
a
strike
,
had
break-even
results
,
against
$
3
million
a
year
ago

nine
months

GTE
said
net
income
rose
18
%
,
aided
by
higher
long-distance
calling
volumes
and
an
increase
in
telephone
lines
in

.

Pretax
operating
profit
from

operations
rose
8.2

rose
8.8

The

said
the

in

usage
for

calling
and
a
5
%
increase
in
the

Earlier
rate
reductions
in

reduced
the

's
revenue
and
operating
profit
$
55
million
;
a
year
earlier
,
operating
profit
in
telephone
operations
was
reduced
by
a
similar
amount
as
a
result
of

Revenue
in

operating

at

Daniel
Akerson
,

chief

said
the

sees
further
improvements
in

margins
.

``
We
think
we
can
take
it
to
the
18
%
range
over
next
18

he
said

In

Charles
Schellke
,
an
analyst
with
Smith
Barney
,
Harris
Upham
&
Co.
,
said
some
investors
apparently
expected
slightly
better
revenue
growth
.

The
company
said
that
residential
traffic
grew
faster
than
business
traffic
and
attributed
that
to
its
new
PrimeTime
calling
plan
that
competes
with
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
's
Reach
Out
America
plan
.

MCI
claims
about
12
%
of
the
overall
long-distance
telephone
market
but
just
under
10
%
of
the
$
23
billion
residential
market
.

It
has
been
trying
to
improve
its
share
of
the
residential
market
.

The
company
wants
its
business
mix
to
more
closely
match
that
of
AT&T
--
a
step
it
says
will
help
prevent
cross
subsidization
.

Mr.
Akerson
said
MCI
recorded
``
another
solid
cash
positive
quarter
,
''
its
fourth
in
a
row
,
but
declined
to
comment
on
whether
the
company
is
considering
a
dividend
or
is
planning
any
acquisition
.

The
current
quarter
,
he
said
,
``
looks
fine
.

We
think
revenue
will
continue
to
grow
and
that
we
can
control
costs
and
thus
improve
profitability
.

Southwestern

Southwestern
Bell

said
net

mainly
the

a

that
its

unit
received
last

;
a

a

The

Thomas
E.
Meador
,

was

,
a

,
subsidiary
of
this

investment
banking

.

Balcor
,
which
has
interests
in

estate
,
said
the
position
is
newly
created
.

Mr.
Meador
had
been
executive
vice
president
of
Balcor
.

In
addition
to
his
previous
real-estate
investment
and
asset-management
duties
,
Mr.

takes
responsibility
for
development
and
property
management

Great
American
Bank
,
citing

prices
,
posted
a
third-quarter
loss
of
$
59.4
million
,
or
$
2.48
a
share
.

A
year
earlier
,
the
savings
bank
had
earnings
of
$
8.1
million
,
or
33
cents
a
share
.

For
the
nine
months
,
it
had
a
loss
of
$
58.3
million
,
or
$
2.44
a
share
,
after
earnings
of
$
29.5
million
,
or
$
1.20
a
share
,
in
the
1988
period
.

Great
American
said
it
increased
its
loan-loss
reserves
by
$
93
million
after
reviewing
its
loan
portfolio
,
raising
its
total
loan
and
real
estate
reserves
to
$
217
million
.

Before
the
loan-loss
addition
,
it
said
,
it
had
operating
profit
of
$
10
million
for
the
quarter
.

The
move
followed
a
round
of
similar
increases
by
other
lenders
against
Arizona
real
estate
loans
,
reflecting
a
continuing
decline
in
that
market
.

In
addition
to
the
increased
reserve
,
the
savings
bank
took
a
special
charge
of
$
5
million
representing
general
and
administrative
expenses
from
staff
reductions
and
other
matters
,
and
it
posted
a
$
7.6
million
reduction
in
expected
mortgage
servicing
fees
,
reflecting
the
fact
that
more
borrowers
are
prepaying
their
mortgages
.

Arbitragers
were
n't
the
only
big
losers
in
the
collapse
of
UAL
Corp.
stock
.

Look
at
what
happened
to
UAL
's
chairman
,
Stephen
M.
Wolf
,
and
its
chief
financial
officer
,
John
C.
Pope
.

On
a
day
some
United
Airlines
employees
wanted
Mr.
Wolf
fired
and
takeover
stock
speculators
wanted
his
scalp
,
Messrs.
Wolf
and
Pope
saw
their
prospective
personal
fortunes
continue
to
plummet
as
shares
of
UAL
,
United
's
parent
company
,
dived
$
24.875
on
the
Big
Board
to
close
at
$
198
.

Including
Monday
's
plunge
,
that
has
given
the
two
executives
paper
losses
of
$
49.5
million
,
based
on
what
they
would
have
realized
had
the
pilots
and
management-led
buy-out
of
UAL
gone
through
at
$
300
a
share
.

When
bank
financing
for
the
buy-out
collapsed
last
week
,
so
did
UAL
's
stock
.

Even
if
the
banks
resurrect
a
financing
package
at
$
250
a
share
,
the
two
executives
would
still
get
about
$
25
million
less
than
they
stood
to
gain
in
the
initial
transaction
.

Mr.
Wolf
owns
75,000
UAL
shares
and
has
options
to
buy
another
250,000
at
$
83.3125
each
.

In
the
$
300-a-share
buyout
,
that
totaled
about
$
76.7
million
.

By
yesterday
's
close
of
trading
,
it
was
good
for
a
paltry
$
43.5
million
.

Of
course
,
Mr.
Wolf
,
48
years
old
,
has
some
savings
.

He
left
his
last
two
jobs
at
Republic
Airlines
and
Flying
Tiger
with
combined
stock-option
gains
of
about
$
22
million
,
and
UAL
gave
him
a
$
15
million
bonus
when
it
hired
him
.

His
1988
salary
was
$
575,000
,
with
a
$
575,000
bonus
.

The
40-year
old
Mr.
Pope
has
n't
changed
jobs
enough
--
at
least
the
right
ones
--
to
stash
away
that
kind
of
money
.

United
paid
him
a
$
375,000
bonus
to
lure
him
away
from
American
Airlines
,
and
he
was
paid
a
salary
of
$
342,122
last
year
with
a
$
280,000
bonus
.

Mr.
Pope
owns
10,000
UAL
shares
and
has
options
to
buy
another
150,000
at
$
69
each
.

That
came
to
a
combined
$
37.7
million
under
the
$
300-a-share
buy-out
,
but
just
$
21.3
million
at
yesterday
's
close
.

Of
the
combined
$
114.4
million
the
two
men
were
scheduled
to
reap
under
the
buy-out
,
they
agreed
to
invest
in
the
buy-out
just
$
15
million
,
angering
many
of
the
thousands
of
workers
asked
to
make
pay
concessions
so
the
buy-out
would
be
a
success
.

United
's
directors
voted
themselves
,
and
their
spouses
,
lifetime
access
to
the
Friendly
Skies
--
free
first-class
travel
,
and
$
20,000
a
year
for
life
as
well
.

Conceivably
,
in
a
scaled-back
buy-out
,
they
could
be
bumped
back
to
coach
seats
for
life
.

Thomas
H.
Johnson
,
president
of
the
Coatedboard

Mr.

contract
calls

years
.

He
will
also
remain
a
director
,
US
Facilities
said
,
but
wo
n't
serve

Mr.

will
be
succeeded

basis
by
George
Kadonada
,
US

In

had
bought
back
112,000
of
its

in

.

Terms
were

The

A

reduced
third-quarter

growth
2
%

introduction
,
the

The

Reuben
Mark
,
chairman
of
Colgate-Palmolive
Co.
,
said
he
is
``
comfortable
''
with
analysts
'
estimates
that
third-quarter
earnings
rose
to
between
95
cents
and
$
1.05
a
share
.

That
compares
with
per-share
earnings
from
continuing
operations
of
69
cents
the
year
earlier
;
including
discontinued
operations
,
per-share
was
88
cents
a
year
ago
.

The
per-share
estimates
mean
the
consumer-products
company
's
net
income
,
increased
to
between
$
69.5
million
and
$
76
million
,
from
$
47.1
million
the
year-before
period
.

Analysts
estimate
Colgate
's
world-wide
third-quarter
sales
rose
about
8
%
to
$
1.29

.

Mr.
Mark
attributed
the
earnings
growth
to
strong
sales
in
Latin
America
,
Asia
and
Europe
.

Results
were
also
bolstered
by
``
a
very
meaningful
''
increase
in
operating
profit
by
Colgate
's
U.S.
business
,
Mr.
Mark
said
.

Operating
profit
at
Colgate
's
U.S.
household
products
and
personal-care
businesses
jumped
25
%
in
the
quarter
,
Mr.
Mark
added
.

He
said
the
improvement
was
a
result
of
cost
savings
achieved
by
consolidating
manufacturing
operations
,
blending
two
sales
organizations
and
focusing
more
carefully
the
company
's
promotional
activities
.

The
estimated
improvement
in
Colgate
's
U.S.
operations
took
some
analysts
by
surprise
.

Colgate
's
household
products
business
,
which
includes
such
brands
as
Fab
laundry
detergent
and
Ajax
cleanser
,
has
been
a
weak
performer
.

Analysts
estimate
Colgate
's
sales
of
household
products
in
the
U.S.
were
flat
for
the
quarter
,
and
they
estimated
operating
margins
at
only
1
%
to
3
%
.

``
If
you
could
say
their
business
in
the
U.S.
was
mediocre
,
but
great
everywhere
else
,
that
would
be
fine
,
''
says
Bonita
Austin
,
an
analyst
with
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

``
But
it
's
not
mediocre
,
it
's
a
real
problem
.

''
Mr.
Mark
conceded
that
Colgate
's
domestic
business
,
apart
from
its
highly
profitable
Hill
's
Pet
Products
unit
,
has
lagged
.

``
We
've
done
a
lot
to
improve
{
U.S

}
results
,
and
a
lot
more
will
be
done
,
''
Mr.
Mark
said

``
Improving
profitability
of

an
extremely
high
priority

By

night

bending

scrapped

Trouble
was

nobody
thought
they
looked
right

--
in
the
second
attack
on
his
employer
in

many

--
averred
that
his
shadowy
countenance
was
so
bad
,
it
looked
``
like
a
face
you
'd
find
on
a
bottle
of
miracle
elixir

promises
to
do
away
with
diarrhea

''
Mr.

reminded

that
he
still
has

forgiven
Globe
management
for
questioning
a

20
expense
chit
he
submitted
for
parking
his

while
chasing
a
story

``

thought

the

boasted

'd

Manson

he
said
.

Mr.

to
the

of

(
``
appears

be

)
,

Carr
,

Deeply
ingrained
in
both
the
book
review
``
Kissing
Nature
Good-bye
''
by
Stephen
MacDonald
(
Leisure
&
Arts
,
Sept.
27
)
and
the
books
reviewed
is
the
assumption
that
global
warming
is
entirely
a
result
of
human
activity
.

Is
such
a
view
justified
?
In
the
absence
of
humans
,
would
the
Earth
enjoy
a
constant
climate
over
the
long
term
?
Clearly
not
.

About
20,000
years
ago
the
last
ice
age
ended
.

Enormous
ice
sheets
retreated
from
the
face
of
North
America
,
northern
Europe
and
Asia
.

This
global
warming
must
have
been
entirely
natural
--
nobody
would
blame
it
on
a
few
hundred
thousand
hunter-gatherers
hunting
mammoths
and
scratching
around
in
caves
.

Furthermore
,
no
bell
has
yet
rung
to
announce
the
end
of
this
immense
episode
of
natural
global
warming
.

It
is
probably
continuing
and
may
well
account
for
most
of
,
or
all
of
,
present-day
global
warming
.

I
bow
to
no
one
in
my
regard
for
our
terrestrial
heritage
,
but
if
we
are
serious
about
global
warming
we
must
look
at
the
big
picture
and
not
allow
the
Dominant
Culture
to
lock
us
into
the
capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global
-
warming
scenario
as
the
sole
model
for
discussion
.

Texas
The
Internal
Revenue
Service
plans
to
restructure
itself
more
like
a
private
corporation
.

In
addition
,
the
tax-collecting
agency
says
that
it
will
take
the
unusual
step
of
looking
to
the
private
sector
to
fill
two
new
high-level
positions
to
guide
the
120,000-employee
agency
:
a
comptroller
to
oversee
daily
finances
and
a
chief
information
officer
to
update
the
information
system
,
which
includes
probably
the
largest
computer
data
base
in
the
world
.

The
IRS
also
said
that
it
would
create
the
position
of
chief
financial
officer
,
who
will
be
hired
from
within
the
agency
.

IRS
Commissioner
Fred
T.
Goldberg
said
the
changes
are
intended
to
bring
``
accountability
''
to
the
agency
,
which
has
an
annual
budget
of
more
than
$
5
billion
and
collects
about
$
1
trillion
a
year
.

``
My
assessment
and
everyone
's
assessment
is
that
we
do
not
have
the
kinds
of
information
that
let
us
responsibly
and
effectively
formulate
and
execute
our
budget
,
''
Mr.
Goldberg
said
.

``
And
we
do
n't
have
internal
controls
and
discipline
that
we
need
to
have
to
spend
$
5
billion
properly
.

''
Mr.
Goldberg
,
who
took
over
as
head
of
the
IRS
in
July
,
has
been
disturbed
by
what
he
considers
the
inefficiency
,
waste
and
lack
of
coordination
among
the
branches
of
the
vast
federal
agency
.

The
IRS
operates
on
a
computer
system
designed
in
1961
,
which
it
has
been
trying
to
modernize
for
years
.

And
the
agency
,
which
operated
throughout
fiscal
1989
with
a
$
360
million
budget
shortfall
,
has
been
under
a
hiring
freeze
since
last
fall
.

The
new
commissioner
says
that
closer
scrutiny
of
how
the
agency
uses
its
resources
will
go
a
long
way
toward
enhancing
its
ability
to
collect
more
tax
revenue
.

``
I
think
that
you
will
see
a
significant
improvement
in
the
budget
formulation
and
execution
process
which
,
in
turn
,
I
believe
will
result
in
a
significant
increase
in
revenue
,
''
he
said
.

The
IRS
hopes
to
fill
the
new
positions
soon
.

Customarily
,
it
would
appoint
career
civil
servants
from
within
the
agency
,
but
Mr.
Goldberg
said
he
plans
to
``
scour
the
world
''
for
the
chief
information
officer
and
the
comptroller
.

Although
the
jobs
will
probably
pay
between
$
70,000
and
$
80,000
a
year
,
IRS
officials
are
confident
that
they
can
attract
top-notch
candidates
from
the
private
sector
.

``
You
're
telling
someone
they
can
spend
the
next
three
or
four
or
five
or
six
years
of
their
life
bringing
about
the
most
difficult
and
costly
modernization
of
an
information
system
on
the
civil
side
ever
,
''
Mr.
Goldberg
said
.

``
On
the
comptroller
side
,
you
're
developing
and
making
work
financial
controls
governing
a
$
6
billion
budget
.

When
Maj.
Moises
Giroldi
,
the
leader
of
the
abortive
coup
in
Panama
,
was
buried
,
his
body
bore
several
gunshot
wounds
,
a
cracked
skull
and
broken
legs
and
ribs
.

They
were
the
signature
of
his
adversary
,
Panamanian
leader
Manuel
Antonio
Noriega
.

The
rebel
officer
's
slow
and
painful
death
,
at
the
headquarters
of
Panama
's
Battalion-2000
squad
,
was
personally
supervised
by
Gen.
Noriega
,
says
a
U.S.
official
with
access
to
intelligence
reports
.

Leaping
into
rages
,
sinking
into
bouts
of
drunkenness
and
mistrust
,
Mr.
Noriega
has
put
to
death
some
70
of
his
troops
involved
in
the
coup
,
according
to
U.S.
officials
monitoring
crematoriums
and
funeral
parlors
in
Panama
City
.

He
is
now
changing
the
place
he
sleeps
every
night
,
sometimes
more
than
once
a
night
.

His
meals
are
most
often
prepared
by
women
he
trusts
--
his
full-time
mistress
,
Vicky
Amado
,
and
her
mother
,
Norma
.

And
he
is
collecting
the
names
of
those
who
telephoned
the
coup-makers
to
congratulate
them
during
their
brief
time
in
control
of
his
headquarters
.

More
enemies
to
be
dealt
with
.

In
the
two
weeks
since
the
rebellion
,
which
the
U.S.
hesitantly
backed
,
Mr.
Noriega
has
been
at
his
most
brutal
-
and
efficient
-
in
maintaining
power
.

Yet
,
while
the
failed
coup
is
a
major
U.S.
foreign
policy
embarrassment
,
it
is
merely
the
latest
chapter
in
a
byzantine
relationship
between
Mr.
Noriega
and
Washington
that
stretches
back
three
decades
.

America
's
war
on
the
dictator
over
the
past
two
years
,
following
his
indictment
on
drug
charges
in
February
1988
,
is
the
legacy
of
that
relationship
.

Before
American
foreign
policy
set
out
to
destroy
Noriega
,
it
helped
create
him
out
of
the
crucible
of
Panama
's
long
history
of
conspirators
and
pirates
.

For
most
of
the
past
30
years
,
the
marriage
was
one
of
convenience
.

In
1960
,
for
example
,
when
Mr.
Noriega
was
both
a
cadet
at
an
elite
military
academy
in
Peru
and
a
spy-in-training
for
the
U.S.
Defense
Intelligence
Agency
,
he
was
detained
by
Lima
authorities
for
allegedly
raping
and
savagely
beating
a
prostitute
,
according
to
a
U.S.
Embassy
cable
from
that
period
.

The
woman
had
nearly
died
.

But
U.S.
intelligence
,
rather
than
rein
in
or
cut
loose
its
new
spy
,
merely
filed
the
report
away
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
tips
on
emerging
leftists
at
his
school
were
deemed
more
important
to
U.S.
interests
.

From
that
point
on
,
the
U.S.
would
make
a
practice
of
overlooking
the
Panamanian
's
misadventures
.

The
U.S.
has
befriended
and
later
turned
against
many
dictators
,
but
none
quite
so
resourceful
.

The
55-year-old
Mr.
Noriega
is
n't
as
smooth
as
the
shah
of
Iran
,
as
well-born
as
Nicaragua
's
Anastasio
Somoza
,
as
imperial
as
Ferdinand
Marcos
of
the
Philippines
or
as
bloody
as
Haiti
's
Baby
Doc
Duvalier
.

Yet
he
has
proved
more
resilient
than
any
of
them
.

And
out
of
necessity
:
The
U.S.
can
make
mistakes
and
still
hope
to
remove
him
from
power
,
but
a
single
error
on
his
part
could
cost
him
his
life
.

``
The
U.S.
underestimated
Noriega
all
along
,
''
says
Ambler
Moss
,
a
former
Ambassador
to
Panama
.

``
He
has
mastered
the
art
of
survival
.

''
In
keeping
with
America
's
long
history
of
propping
up
Mr.
Noriega
,
recent
U.S.
actions
have
extended
rather
than
shortened
his
survival
.

Mr.
Noriega
might
have
fallen
of
his
own
weight
in
1988
because
of
Panama
's
dire
economic
situation
,
says
Mr.
Moss
,
but
increasing
external
pressure
has
only
given
him
additional
excuses
for
repression
,
and
a
scapegoat
for
his
own
mismanagement
.

``
If
the
U.S.
had
sat
back
and
done
nothing
,
he
might
not
have
made
it
through
1988
,
''
Mr.
Moss
contends
.

Perhaps
most
important
,
Mr.
Noriega
's
allies
have
intervened
to
encourage
--
in
some
cases
,
to
demand
--
that
the
dictator
maintain
his
grip
of
the
throne
.

One
Colombian
drug
boss
,
upon
hearing
in
1987
that
Gen.
Noriega
was
negotiating
with
the
U.S.
to
abandon
his
command
for
a
comfortable
exile
,
sent
him
a
hand-sized
mahogany
coffin
engraved
with
his
name
.

``
He
is
cornered
,
''
says
the
Rev.
Fernando
Guardia
,
who
has
led
Catholic
Church
opposition
against
Noriega
.

``
The
Americans
have
left
him
without
a
way
out
.

It
is
easy
to
fight
when
you
do
n't
have
any
other
option
.

''
His
chief
advantage
in
the
fight
:
his
intimate
knowledge
of
American
ways
and
weaknesses
.

Mr.
Noriega
often
tells
friends
that
patience
is
the
best
weapon
against
the
gringos
,
who
have
a
short
attention
span
and
little
stomach
for
lasting
confrontation
.

The
U.S.
discovered
the
young
Tony
Noriega
in
late
1959
,
when
he
was
in
his
second
year
at
the
Chorrillos
Military
Academy
in
Lima
,
according
to
former
U.S.
intelligence
officials
.

The
contact
occurred
through
Mr.
Noriega
's
half-brother
,
a
Panamanian
diplomat
based
in
Peru
named
Luis
Carlos
Noriega
Hurtado
.

Luis
Carlos
,
knowing
that
helping
the
Americans
could
advance
the
career
of
any
Panamanian
officer
,
relayed
Tony
's
reports
on
the
leftist
tendencies
he
observed
among
his
fellow
students
and
,
more
important
,
among
his
officers
and
instructors
.

A
spy
was
born
.

It
was
a
heady
experience
for
the
pockmarked
and
slightly
built
Mr.
Noriega
,
who
was
known
to
his
friends
as
Cara
la
Pina
--
pineapple
face
.

Born
the
illegitimate
son
of
his
father
's
maid
,
he
was
raised
on
the
mean
streets
of
the
central
market
district
of
Panama
City
.

Tony
was
four
years
older
than
most
of
his
fellow
cadets
,
and
gained
admission
to
the
academy
because
his
brother
had
falsified
his
birth
certificate
.

He
considered
himself
intellectually
superior
to
his
Peruvian
peers
,
many
of
whom
were
wayward
sons
sent
by
their
well-off
families
to
the
highly
disciplined
,
French-modeled
academy
as
a
sort
of
reform
school
.

In
his
peaked
military
cap
and
neatly
pressed
,
French-made
uniform
,
Noriega
felt
more
respected
and
powerful
than
ever
in
his
underprivileged
life
,
friends
from
the
period
say
.

``
He
had
an
elegant
uniform
with
gold
buttons
in
a
country
where
there
was
a
cult
of
militarism
,
where
officers
were
the
elite
with
special
privileges
,
''
recalls
Darien
Ayala
,
a
fellow
student
in
Peru
and
a
lifelong
friend
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
relationship
to
American
intelligence
agencies
became
contractual
in
either
1966
or
1967
,
intelligence
officials
say
.

His
commanding
officer
at
the
Chiriqui
Province
garrison
,
Major
Omar
Torrijos
,
gave
him
an
intriguing
assignment
:
Mr.
Noriega
would
organize
the
province
's
first
intelligence
service
.

The
spy
network
would
serve
two
clients
:
the
Panamanian
government
,
by
monitoring
political
opponents
in
the
region
,
and
the
U.S.
,
by
tracking
the
growing
Communist
influence
in
the
unions
organized
at
United
Fruit
Co.
's
banana
plantations
in
Bocas
del
Toros
and
Puerto
Armuelles
.

United
Fruit
was
one
of
the
two
largest
contributors
to
Panama
's
national
income
.

Satisfying
its
interests
was
a
priority
for
any
Panamanian
leader
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
initial
retainer
was
only
$
50
to
$
100
a
month
,
plus
occasional
gifts
of
liquor
or
groceries
from
the
American
PX
,
a
former
intelligence
official
says
.

It
was
modest
pay
by
American
standards
,
but
a
healthy
boost
to
his
small
military
salary
,
which
fellow
officers
remember
as
having
been
$
300
to
$
400
monthly
.

``
He
did
it
very
well
,
''
recalls
Boris
Martinez
,
a
former
Panamanian
colonel
who
managed
Mr.
Noriega
and
his
operation
.

``
He
started
building
the
files
that
helped
him
gain
power
.

''
A
National
Guard
job
assumed
by
Capt.
Noriega
in
1964
--
as
chief
of
the
transit
police
in
David
City
,
capital
of
the
Chiriqui
Province
--
was
tailor-made
for
an
aspiring
super-spy
.

By
pressuring
taxi
and
bus
drivers
who
needed
licenses
,
he
gained
a
ready
cache
of
information
.

He
knew
which
local
luminaries
had
been
caught
driving
drunk
,
which
had
been
found
with
their
mistresses
.

This
proved
particularly
valuable
to
the
Panamanian
government
in
1967
,
when
union
leaders
were
planning
a
May
Day
march
that
the
government
feared
could
turn
violent
.

Mr.
Noriega
had
learned
that
a
local
union
leader
was
sleeping
with
the
wife
of
his
deputy
.

So
he
splashed
the
information
on
handbills
that
he
distributed
throughout
the
banana-exporting
city
of
Puerto
Armuelles
,
which
was
ruled
by
United
Fruit
Co
.

The
campaign
so
divided
union
leaders
that
the
government
found
them
far
easier
to
control
.

``
It
was
like
a
play
on
Broadway
,
''
recalls
Mr.
Martinez
.

``
Noriega
managed
the
whole
thing
.

He
was
superb
.

Noriega
was
an
expert
at
bribing
and
blackmailing
people
.

''
During
his
years
in
Chiriqui
,
however
,
Mr.
Noriega
also
revealed
himself
as
an
officer
as
perverse
as
he
was
ingenious
.

Rodrigo
Miranda
,
a
local
lawyer
and
human-rights
monitor
,
recalls
an
intoxicated
Noriega
visiting
prisoners
in
their
cells
at
the
5th
Zone
Garrison
headquarters
in
David
,
where
he
had
his
offices
.

Mr.
Noriega
would
order
them
all
to
take
off
their
clothes
and
run
around
the
courtyard
naked
,
laughing
at
them
and
then
retreating
to
his
office
.

``
People
started
wondering
if
something
was
wrong
with
him
,
''
Mr.
Miranda
recalls
.

But
through
this
period
,
so
far
as
the
U.S.
military
was
concerned
,
Mr.
Noriega
was
a
model
recruit
.

He
signed
up
for
intelligence
and
counter-intelligence
training
under
American
officers
at
Fort
Gulick
in
Panama
in
July
1967
,
according
to
a
copy
of
a
1983
resume
with
details
Mr.
Noriega
has
since
classified
as
secret
.

He
flew
to
Fort
Bragg
,
N.C.
,
in
September
of
that
year
for
a
course
in
psychological
operations
,
returning
to
the
School
of
the
Americas
in
Panama
for
a
two-month
course
called
``
military
intelligence
for
officers
.

''
Some
American
officers
interpreted
his
eagerness
and
studiousness
as
a
sign
of
loyalty
,
but
they
did
so
falsely
.

He
rose
to
chief
of
intelligence
in
Panama
's
socalled
G-2
in
1970
after
providing
populist
dictator
Torrijos
the
critical
support
to
defeat
a
coup
attempt
against
him
a
year
earlier
.

He
became
Gen.
Torrijos
's
inseparable
shadow
,
and
the
holder
of
all
Panama
's
secrets
.

Mr.
Noriega
,
by
now
a
lieutenant
colonel
,
expanded
his
contacts
to
include
the
Cubans
--
not
to
mention
the
Israelis
,
the
Taiwanese
and
any
other
intelligence
service
that
came
knocking
.

When
U.S.
diplomats
complained
to
the
CIA
of
Col.
Noriega
's
moonlighting
,
intelligence
experts
always
insisted
that
his
allegiance
was
first
to
the
Americans
.

``
Early
on
in
the
State
Department
,
we
took
to
calling
him
the
rent-a-colonel
,
in
tribute
to
his
ability
to
simultaneously
milk
the
antagonistic
intelligence
services
of
Cuba
and
the
United
States
,
''
recalls
Francis
J.
McNeil
,
who
,
as
deputy
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
inter-American
affairs
,
first
ran
across
reports
about
Mr.
Noriega
in
1977
.

``
Some
of
us
wondered
how
our
intelligence
people
could
put
so
much
stock
in
his
information
when
he
was
just
as
close
to
the
Cubans
.

''
Even
at
this
early
stage
,
drugs
caused
additional
concerns
.

During
the
Nixon
administration
,
the
Drug
Enforcement
Administration
became
dismayed
at
the
extent
of
the
G-2
's
connections
to
arrested
drug
traffickers
.

One
DEA
agent
drew
up
a
list
of
five
options
for
dealing
with
Col.
Noriega
,
one
of
which
was
assassination
.

The
head
of
the
DEA
at
the
time
,
John
Ingersoll
,
scotched
the
assassination
plan
.

But
he
did
fly
to
Panama
to
scold
dictator
Torrijos
on
the
drug
ties
of
Panamanian
officials
,
including
Mr.
Noriega
.

Mr.
Ingersoll
later
recalled
that
Gen.
Torrijos
seemed
afraid
to
act
on
the
concerns
of
the
U.S
.

``
Everybody
was
afraid
of
him
,
''
Mr.
Ingersoll
says
.

Mr.
Noriega
became
an
even
greater
threat
in
1976
,
when
U.S.
intelligence
services
discovered
that
he
had
been
buying
recordings
of
electronically
monitored
conversations
from
three
sergeants
working
for
the
U.S.
Army
's
470th
Military
Intelligence
Group
.

The
tapes
included
wiretaps
of
Gen.
Torrijos
's
own
phone
,
according
to
American
intelligence
officials
.

``
We
caught
him
with
his
hands
on
our
cookie
jar
,
''
says
former
CIA
Director
Stansfield
Turner
.

For
the
first
time
,
the
U.S.
considered
cutting
Mr.
Noriega
from
its
intelligence
payroll
--
and
the
deliberations
were
intense
,
Mr.
Turner
says
.

``
In
the
world
of
intelligence
,
if
you
want
to
get
information
,
you
get
it
from
seedy
characters
.

The
question
is
how
much
you
get
tied
in
with
seedy
characters
so
they
can
extort
you
.

''
Intelligence
officials
to
this
day
worry
whether
Mr.
Noriega
sold
sensitive
information
on
the
recordings
to
the
Cubans
or
others
.

Mr.
Turner
was
troubled
enough
to
cancel
the
U.S.
contract
with
the
rent-a-colonel
at
the
beginning
of
the
Carter
administration
.

The
U.S.
soon
found
new
cause
for
concern
:
gun-running
.

Prosecutors
in
Southern
Florida
indicted
five
Panamanians
on
charges
of
illegally
running
arms
to
Sandinista
rebels
trying
to
overthrow
the
Nicaraguan
government
of
Mr.
Somoza
.

They
included
one
of
Mr.
Noriega
's
closest
friends
and
business
partners
,
Carlos
Wittgreen
.

And
the
investigators
were
quickly
closing
in
on
Mr.
Noriega
himself
.

At
the
time
,
though
,
in
1979
,
the
U.S.
was
once
again
flirting
with
its
longtime
Latin
American
spy
.

Mr.
Noriega
made
plans
to
fly
to
Washington
for
a
meeting
with
his
counterpart
at
the
Pentagon
.

Dade
County
and
federal
authorities
,
learning
that
he
intended
to
fly
through
Miami
,
made
plans
to
arrest
him
on
the
gun-running
charges
as
soon
as
he
hit
U.S.
soil
.

It
was
a
Friday
in
June
.

The
Pentagon
foiled
the
plan
.

According
to
military
officers
at
the
time
,
word
was
passed
to
Mr.
Noriega
by
his
American
hosts
that
the
police
would
be
waiting
.

On
Monday
,
U.S.
officials
received
a
routine
,
unclassified
message
from
the
military
group
commander
in
Panama
.

``
Due
to
health
reasons
,
Lt.
Col.
Noriega
has
elected
to
postpone
his
visit
to
Washington
,
''
it
read
.

Prosecutors
in
Miami
received
yet
another
setback
.

Their
original
indictment
against
Mr.
Wittgreen
,
the
friend
of
Mr.
Noriega
,
and
the
other
four
was
dismissed
on
a
technicality
.

But
now
,
along
with
reindicting
Mr.
Noriega
's
pal
,
they
intended
to
charge
Mr.
Noriega
himself
,
on
allegations
that
he
was
involved
in
the
illegal
trading
of
some
$
2
million
in
arms
.

In
January
1980
,
Jerome
Sanford
,
as
assistant
U.S.
attorney
,
was
summoned
to
a
meeting
with
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
agent
assigned
to
the
Bureau
of
Alcohol
,
Tobacco
and
Firearms
in
Miami
.

Panamanian
dictator
Torrijos
,
he
was
told
,
had
granted
the
shah
of
Iran
asylum
in
Panama
as
a
favor
to
Washington
.

Mr.
Sanford
was
told
Mr.
Noriega
's
friend
,
Mr.
Wittgreen
,
would
be
handling
the
shah
's
security
.

It
would
n't
be
a
good
idea
to
indict
him
--
much
less
Mr.
Noriega
,
the
prosecutor
was
told
.

After
prodding
from
Mr.
Sanford
,
U.S.
Attorney
Jack
Eskenazi
pleaded
with
Justice
Department
officials
in
Washington
to
let
the
indictment
proceed
.

``
Unfortunately
,
''
Mr.
Eskenazi
wrote
in
a
letter
,
``
those
of
us
in
law
enforcement
in
Miami
find
ourselves
frequently
attempting
to
enforce
the
laws
of
the
United
States
but
simultaneously
being
caught
between
foreign
policy
considerations
over
which
we
have
no
control
.

''
The
letter
,
along
with
a
detailed
prosecution
memo
,
sat
on
the
desks
of
Justice
officials
for
months
before
the
case
died
a
quiet
death
.

``
I
think
if
we
had
been
allowed
to
go
ahead
then
we
would
n't
have
the
problems
we
have
now
,
''
Mr.
Sanford
says
.

``
If
he
had
been
found
guilty
,
we
could
have
stopped
him
.

''
In
August
1983
,
Mr.
Noriega
took
over
as
General
and
de-facto
dictator
of
Panama
,
having
maneuvered
his
way
to
the
top
only
two
years
after
the
mysterious
death
in
a
plane
crash
of
his
old
boss
Omar
Torrijos
.

Soon
,
the
military
became
a
veritable
mafia
controlling
legal
and
illegal
businesses
.

The
Reagan
administration
also
put
Mr.
Noriega
's
G-2
back
on
the
U.S.
payroll
.

Payments
averaged
nearly
$
200,000
a
year
from
the
U.S.
Defense
Intelligence
Agency
and
the
CIA
.

Although
working
for
U.S.
intelligence
,
Mr.
Noriega
was
hardly
helping
the
U.S.
exclusively
.

During
the
Reagan
years
he
expanded
his
business
and
intelligence
contacts
with
the
Cubans
and
the
Sandinistas
.

He
allegedly
entered
into
Panama
's
first
formal
business
arrangement
with
Colombian
drug
bosses
,
according
to
Floyd
Carlton
,
a
pilot
who
once
worked
for
Mr.
Noriega
and
who
testified
before
the
U.S.
grand
jury
in
Miami
that
would
ultimately
indict
the
Panamanian
on
drug
charges
.

But
Mr.
Noriega
was
convinced
the
Reagan
White
House
would
n't
act
against
him
,
recalls
his
close
ally
Jose
Blandon
,
because
he
had
an
insurance
policy
:
his
involvement
with
the
Contra
rebels
in
Nicaragua
.

Mr.
Blandon
says
the
general
allowed
the
Contras
to
set
up
a
secret
training
center
in
Panama
.

Mr.
Noriega
also
conveyed
intelligence
from
his
spy
operation
inside
the
Nicaraguan
capital
of
Managua
.

And
on
at
least
one
occasion
,
in
the
spring
of
1985
,
he
helped
arrange
a
sabotage
attack
on
a
Sandinista
arsenal
in
Nicaragua
.

Although
,
his
help
for
the
Contra
cause
was
limited
,
it
was
enough
to
win
him
important
protectors
in
the
Reagan
administration
,
says
Sen.
Patrick
Leahy
,
a
Vermont
Democrat
who
then
served
on
the
Senate
Intelligence
Committee
.

``
Noriega
played
U.S.
intelligence
agencies
and
the
U.S.
government
like
a
violin
,
''
he
says
.

An
incident
in
1984
suggested
one
additional
means
by
which
Mr.
Noriega
might
have
maintained
such
influence
with
Washington
--
by
compromising
U.S.
officials
.

Curtin
Windsor
,
then
the
ambassador
to
Costa
Rica
,
recalls
being
invited
to
Panama
by
Mr.
Noriega
's
brother
Luis
Carlos
for
a
weekend
of
deep
sea
fishing
and
``
quiet
,
serious
conversation
''
on
the
Aswara
Peninsula
.

Mr.
Windsor
notified
Everett
E.
Briggs
,
the
U.S.
ambassador
to
Panama
,
of
the
invitation
.

``
Briggs
screamed
,
''
Mr.
Windsor
recalls
.

He
says
Mr.
Briggs
told
him
he
was
being
set
up
for
a
``
honey
trap
,
''
in
which
Mr.
Noriega
would
try
to
involve
him
in
an
orgy
and
then
record
the
event
``
with
sound
and
video
.

''
Mr.
Briggs
,
on
vacation
after
resigning
his
position
at
the
National
Security
Council
,
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

As
Mr.
Noriega
's
political
troubles
grew
,
so
did
his
offers
of
assistance
to
the
Contras
,
an
apparent
attempt
to
curry
more
favor
in
Washington
.

For
instance
,
he
helped
steal
the
May
1984
Panamanian
elections
for
the
ruling
party
.

But
just
one
month
later
,
he
also
contributed
$
100,000
to
a
Contra
leader
,
according
to
documents
released
for
Oliver
North
's
criminal
trial
in
Washington
,
D.C
.

Yet
,
his
political
setbacks
mounted
.

Mr.
Noriega
was
accused
of
ordering
in
1985
the
beheading
of
Hugo
Spadafora
,
his
most
outspoken
political
opponent
and
the
first
man
to
publicly
finger
Mr.
Noriega
on
drug
trafficking
charges
.

He
then
ousted
President
Nicholas
Ardito
Barletta
,
a
former
World
Bank
official
with
close
ties
to
the
U.S.
,
after
Mr.
Barletta
tried
to
create
a
commission
to
investigate
the
murder
.

And
,
all
the
while
,
Panama
's
debt
problems
continued
to
grow
.

Mr.
Noriega
was
growing
desperate
.

In
late
1986
,
he
made
an
offer
he
thought
the
U.S.
could
n't
refuse
.

As
recounted
in
a
stipulation
that
summarized
government
documents
released
for
the
North
trial
,
Mr.
Noriega
offered
to
assassinate
the
Sandinista
leadership
in
exchange
``
for
a
promise
to
help
clean
up
Noriega
's
image
and
a
commitment
to
lift
the
{
U.S
.

}
ban
on
military
sales
to
the
Panamanian
Defense
Forces
.

''
``
North
,
''
the
document
went
on
,
referring
to
Oliver
North
,
``
has
told
Noriega
's
representative
that
U.S.
law
forbade
such
actions
.

The
representative
responded
that
Noriega
had
numerous
assets
in
place
in
Nicaragua
and
could
accomplish
many
essential
things
,
just
as
Noriega
had
helped
{
the
U.S
.

}
the
previous
year
in
blowing
up
a
Sandinista
arsenal
.

''
Col.
North
conveyed
the
request
to
his
superiors
and
to
Assistant
Secretary
of
State
Elliot
Abrams
,
who
relayed
it
to
Secretary
of
State
George
Shultz
.

Mr.
Noriega
's
proposal
was
turned
down
.

And
Mr.
Shultz
curtly
told
Mr.
Abrams
that
the
general
should
be
told
that
only
he
could
repair
his
tarnished
image
.

The
end
of
the
marriage
was
at
hand
.

Within
weeks
the
unfolding
Iran-Contra
scandal
took
away
Mr.
Noriega
's
insurance
policy
.

The
death
of
CIA
Director
William
Casey
and
resignation
of
Oliver
North
allowed
anti-Noriega
political
forces
to
gain
influence
.

Public
protests
against
him
were
triggered
in
June
1987
due
to
charges
by
Diaz
Herrera
,
his
former
chief
of
staff
,
that
Mr.
Noriega
had
stolen
the
1984
election
and
had
ordered
the
killing
of
Messrs.
Spadafora
and
Torrijos
.

Few
American
officials
were
willing
any
longer
to
defend
him
.

Lawyers
in
Miami
--
this
time
working
virtually
without
impediment
--
prepared
to
have
him
indicted
on
drug
charges
in
February
1988
.

During
negotiations
with
American
officials
in
May
1988
over
proposals
to
drop
the
U.S.
indictments
in
exchange
for
his
resignation
,
Mr.
Noriega
often
asked
almost
plaintively
how
the
Americans
,
whom
he
had
helped
for
so
many
years
,
could
turn
against
him
.

Now
,
neither
side
--
the
U.S.
nor
Mr.
Noriega
--
has
an
easy
out
.

President
Bush
has
sworn
to
bring
him
to
justice
.

Mr.
Noriega
believes
he
has
n't
any
alternative
but
to
continue
clutching
to
power
.

It
is
a
knock-out
battle
--
perhaps
to
the
death
.

In
the
end
,
is
Mr.
Noriega
the
political
equivalent
of
Frankenstein
's
monster
,
created
by
a
well-intentioned
but
misguided
foreign
power
?
Not
quite
,
Sen.
Leahy
contends
.

``
For
short-term
gains
,
people
were
willing
to
put
up
with
him
.

That
allowed
him
to
get
stronger
and
stronger
,
''
he
says
.

``
I
do
n't
think
we
created
him
as
much
as
we
fed
him
,
nurtured
him
and
let
him
grow
up
to
be
big
and
strong
.

Yesterday
's
edition
provided
analysts
'
estimates
for
the
company
when
actual
earnings
were
available
.

Industrial
production
declined
0.1
%
in
September
,
reinforcing
other
signs
that
the
manufacturing
sector
continues
its
slowing
trend
.

The
Federal
Reserve
Board
said
output
of
the
nation
's
factories
,
mines
and
utilities
expanded
at
an
annual
rate
of
1.3
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
substantially
slower
than
the
3.3
%
annual
rate
in
the
second
quarter
.

``
Capital
spending
and
exports
,
which
have
been
the
driving
force
in
this
expansion
,
are
showing
clear
signs
of
having
the
steam
taken
out
of
them
,
''
said
Robert
Dederick
,
economist
for
Northern
Trust
Co.
in
Chicago
.

The
new
reports
of
sluggishness
,
which
were
foreshadowed
by
an
earlier
Labor
Department
report
that
manufacturing
payrolls
dropped
by
105,000
in
September
,
give
the
Fed
another
reason
to
further
ease
its
grip
on
credit
and
lower
interest
rates
.

``
They
need
to
do
something
about
this
,
''
said
Maury
Harris
,
economist
at
PaineWebber
Group
Inc
.

The
Fed
also
said
U.S.
industry
operated
at
83.6
%
of
capacity
last
month
,
down
from
83.8
%
in
August
.

Measures
of
manufacturing
activity
fell
more
than
the
overall
measures
.

Factory
output
dropped
0.2
%
,
its
first
decline
since
February
,
after
having
been
unchanged
in
October
.

Factories
operated
at
83.7
%
of
capacity
,
the
lowest
rate
in
more
than
a
year
and
down
from
84.1
%
in
September
.

The
declines
mainly
reflected
widespread
weakness
in
durable
goods
,
those
intended
to
last
more
than
three
years
.

The
biggest
drop
was
recorded
by
primary
metals
producers
,
a
category
that
includes
the
steel
industry
.

Output
of
business
equipment
was
unchanged
in
September
.

Production
of
factory
equipment
,
one
indication
of
the
strength
of
manufacturers
'
investment
spending
,
fell
0.3
%
.

Some
economists
expect
further
declines
in
investment
spending
.

``
Whenever
corporate
profits
are
weak
that
means
capital
spending
is
going
to
soften
subsequently
,
''
Mr.
Harris
said
.

``
You
have
n't
seen
the
full
effect
of
that
yet
.

''
A
decline
in
truck
production
more
than
offset
a
sharp
rise
in
auto
assemblies
,
the
Fed
noted
.

Analysts
do
n't
expect
the
September
surge
in
auto
production
to
be
repeated
in
the
coming
months
.

Here
is
a
summary
of
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
's
report
on
industrial
production
in
September
.

The
figures
are
seasonally
adjusted
.

142.3
%
of
the
1977
average
.

Robin
Honiss
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
this
bank
holding
company
,
was
elected
to
the
additional
posts
of
chairman
,
president
and
chief
executive
of
the
company
's
New
England
Savings
Bank
subsidiary
.

William
R.
Attridge
resigned
those
posts
,

on
NESB
's
board

NESB

Lung-cancer
mortality
rates
for
people
under
45
years
of
age
have
begun
to
decline
,
federal
researchers
report
.

The
drop
is
particularly
large
for
white
males
,
although
black
males
and
white
and
black
women
also
show
lower
mortality
rates
.

A
report
in
this
week
's
issue
of
the
Journal
of
the
National
Cancer
Institute
also
projects
that
overall
U.S.
mortality
rates
from
lung
cancer
,
the
leading
cause
of
cancer
death
,
should
begin
to
drop
in
several
years
if
cigarette
smoking
continues
to
abate
.

The
report
,
which
comes
25
years
after
the
U.S.
Surgeon
General
issued
a
report
warning
against
the
dangers
of
smoking
,
is
the
strongest
indication
to
date
that
the
reduction
in
smoking
is
leading
to
lower
death
rates
from
lung
cancer
.

``
What
this
is
saying
is
that
the
surgeon
general
's
message
is
having
an
impact
,
''
said
Melvyn
Tockman
,
an
epidemiologist
at
the
Johns
Hopkins
School
of
Hygiene
and
Public
Health
in
Baltimore
.

The
National
Cancer
Institute
report
compares
mortality
rates
of
two
groups
of
people
between
the
ages
of
35
and
44
a
decade
apart
.

The
death
rate
from
lung
cancer
of
white
males
aged
35
to
44
in
the
mid-1970s
was
13.4
per
100,000
,
but
the
mortality
rate
of
the
same
age
group
in
the
mid-1980s
was
9.6
,
a
decline
of
28.7
%
.

Measured
the
same
way
,
the
decline
for
black
males
was
14.2
%
.

The
drop
in
mortality
rates
for
women
was
less
steep
--
8.9
%
for
blacks
and
5.3
%
for
whites
.

The
study
,
by
Susan
Devesa
,
William
Blot
and
Joseph
Fraumeni
of
the
institute
's
staff
,
also
shows
that
the
incidence
of
lung
cancer
as
well
as
the
death
rate
declined
over
the
decade
for
all
groups
in
the
35-44
age
bracket
,
except
black
men
.

Although
lung-cancer
mortality
rates
are
increasing
for
the
nation
as
a
whole
,
the
report
projects
that
death
rates
will
begin
to
decline
in
the
1990s
for
men
and
after
the
year
2000
for
women
.

Lung-cancer
mortality
rates
increase
with
age
and
are
continuing
to
rise
for
all
age
groups
over
55
,
with
sharp
increases
for
everybody
but
white
men
.

But
Dr.
Fraumeni
,
one
of
the
authors
of
the
report
,
said
``
the
declining
rates
we
're
seeing
for
younger
people
we
believe
may
be
a
harbinger
of
declining
mortality
in
the
future
.

''
However
,
he
stressed
that
the
improvement
depends
on
a
continued
reduction
in
smoking
.

``
Even
though
these
favorable
trends
in
lung-cancer
mortality
affect
all
sex
and
race
groups
,
they
ca
n't
be
taken
for
granted
,
''
the
report
says
.

``
Smoking
prevention
programs
should
reach
larger
segments
of
the
population
,
especially
children
,
adolescents
and
minorities
.

''
An
editorial
in
the
NCI
Journal
says
the
report
of
declining
lung-cancer
mortality
``
among
young
men
and
women
in
the
U.S.
indicates
that
we
finally
may
be
winning
the
battle
--
this
even
in
a
country
where
the
tobacco
industry
spends
over
$
2
billion
a
year
for
promotion
of
the
addictive
habit
of
smoking
.

''
But
the
editorial
,
by
Jan
Stjernsward
of
the
World
Health
Organization
,
notes
that
tobacco
consumption
and
lung-cancer
mortality
rates
are
rising
in
developing
countries
.

``
Non-smoking
should
be
established
as
the
norm
of
social
behavior
''
around
the
world
,
the
editorial
says
,
through
the
enactment
of
laws
that
limit
advertising
,
boost
tobacco
prices
and
promote
anti-smoking
education
.

Asked
for
comment
,
Walker
Merryman
,
a
vice
president
of
the
Tobacco
Institute
,
said
new
efforts
to
restrict
tobacco
advertising
in
the
U.S.
could
violate
the
First
Amendment
protection
of
free
speech
.

According
to
the
American
Cancer
Society
,
smoking
is
responsible
for
85
%
of
the
lung-cancer
cases
among
men
and
75
%
among
women
.

The
NCI
report
attributes
the
differences
in
mortality
rates
by
race
to
different
smoking
patterns
.

A
higher
proportion
of
black
men
smoke
than
white
men
.

While
nearly
equal
percentages
of
black
and
white
women
currently
smoke
,
in
both
sexes
more
whites
have
given
up
smoking
than
blacks
.

In
comparing
changes
in
mortality
rates
over
the
past
decade
,
the
NCI
study
looked
only
at
blacks
and
whites
.

Asians
and
native
Americans
were
n't
studied
;
Hispanics
were
included
with
whites
.

Traders
trying
to
profit
from
the
recent
volatility
in
financial
markets
invaded
the
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
market
,
prompting
even
more
swings
in
stock
prices
.

After
gaining
strength
during
a
brief
run-up
when
trading
began
,
the
Nasdaq
Composite
Index
weakened
under
selling
pressure
.

The
forces
at

included
computer-guided
trading
,
as
well
as
profit-driven
market
makers
and
institutional
investors
who
had
bought
stock
on
the
cheap
during
the
recent
correction
.

During
the
last
two
hours
of
trading
,
the
composite
almost
drew
even
on
the
day
before
slipping
again
.

The
Nasdaq
Composite
closed
down
1.05
,
or
0.2
%
,
to
459.93
.

The
action
was
confined
to
Nasdaq
's
biggest
and
most
liquid
stocks
,
traders
said
.

The
Nasdaq
100
Index
began
the
day
at
449.89
,
lost
2
%
at
one
point
,
and
was
up
0.4
%
at
another
.

The
barometer
of
the
biggest
nonfinancial
stocks
settled
at
448.49
,
off
1.40
.

Its
counterpart
,
the
Nasdaq

,
was
weak
for
most
of
the
day
,
sliding
2.51
to
453.57
by
the
end
of
trading
.

The
volatility
was
dizzying
for
traders
.

``
The

down
15

commented
Lance

``

is
a
tough
market

''
Mr.
Zipper
said
the
market
is
still
settling
down
after
the
recent

Most
of

now

take
advantage
of

It

for

The

that

also
pleased
analysts
by
announcing
four
new

Certainly
conservative
environmentalists
can
defend
their
limited
government
position
by
differentiating
between
Old
Environmentalism
and
New
Environmentalism
(
``
Journalists
and
Others
for
Saving
the
Planet
,
''
by
David
Brooks
,
editorial
page
,
Oct.
5
)
.

Old
Environmentalism
involved
microbe
hunters
and
sanitationists
.

It
started
with
improvements
in
hygiene
made
possible
by
affordable
soap
and
washable
underwear
during
the
Industrial
Revolution
.

Then
cast-iron
sewer
pipe
and
the
flush
toilet
were
followed
by
sewage
-
and
water-treatment
plants
toward
the
end
of
the
19th
century
.

Medicine
in
the
19th
century
was
dedicated
mostly
to
combating
sepsis
and
diagnostic
analysis
.

Then
the
20th
century
saw
the
evolution
of
private-sector
wonder
drugs
,
which
promulgated
medical
therapy
.

The
process
dramatically
increased
our
average
life
expectancy
,
eliminated
much
pain
and
constantly
improved
health
and
well-being
.

Most
public-health
measures
were
handled
at
the
local
level
.

New
Environmentalism
probably
started
in
1962
with
the
publication
of
Rachel
Carson
's
book
``
Silent
Spring
.

''
Shortly
thereafter
,
hysterical
articles
began
to
appear
predicting
that
advanced
industrial
societies
would
produce
a
blackened
,
uninhabitable
planet
possibly
by
the
turn
of
the
century
.

These
apocalyptic
predictions
were
advanced
by
such
stalwarts
as
Paul
Ehrlich
,
Barry
Commoner
,
Rene
Dubois
and
George
Wald
.

Writing
in
the
1960s
Ms.
Carson
suggested
that
the
human
race
could
be
eliminated
in
20
years
,
and
Mr.
Wald
suggested
that
life
on
earth
might
end
by
1985
.

Mr.
Ehrlich
predicted
unprecedented
famine
by
1980
.

There
were
many
more
.

Thousands
of
chemical
products
were
categorized
as
carcinogenic
,
with
recommendations
that
they
be
banned
from
industrial
use
because
they
produced
malignant
tumors
in
overdosed
rats
.

Unknown
before
1960
were
the
inconclusive
effects
of
acid
rain
,
greenhouse
warming
and
ozone
depletion
,
all
of
which
required
burgeoning
political
power
and
gargantuan
expense
.

Meanwhile
,
the
New
Environmentalists
systematically
opposed
the
methods
of
the
Old
Environmentalists
.

Local
pollution
problems
require
cheap
energy
and
capital
for
their
solution
.

But
the
New
Environmentalists
oppose
private
wealth
creation
(
which
,
they
claim
,
depletes
natural
resources
)
and
nuclear
power
(
even
though
it
would
counteract
the
greenhouse
effect
)
.

They
are
in
the
forefront
of
opposing
the
search
for
new
landfills
and
methods
of
incineration
and
even
oppose
new
methods
of
research
such
as
genetic
engineering
.

New
Environmentalism
is
an
emotional
attack
on
proven
methods
of
improving
our
quality
of
life
and
a
bid
for
political
power
.

Let
's
rationalize
our
priorities
by
solving
pollution
problems
at
the
local
level
as
heretofore
.

Harry
Lee
Smith

Your
story
missed
some
essential
points
of
the
conference
on
``
The
Global
Environment
:
Are
We
Overreacting
?
''
First
and
foremost
,
the
vignettes
presented
by
the
various
scientists
represent
a
general
consensus
among
specialists
working
in
the
respective
aspects
of
the
global
environment
.

Consider
,
for
example
,
the
greenhouse
effect
and
climate
change
;
numerous
blue-ribbon
scientific
committees
,
including
one
from
the
National
Academy
of
Science
,
judge
there
is
a
greater
than
50
%
probability
of
a
grave
problem
in
the
offing
.

The
point
was
to
answer
the
question
in
the
conference
title
,
not
to
try
to
create
news
stories
for
the
event
itself
.

Nor
was
it
intended
to
dictate
a
set
of
prescriptive
solutions
,
although
various
points
were
raised
.

Each
speaker
was
asked
to
address
a
specific
topic
,
not
deliver
a
point
of
view
.

Each
scientist
independently
concluded
society
and
government
are
underreacting
when
it
comes
to
substantive
policy
change
.

This
leads
to
a
very
special
sense
of
urgency
.

If
the
media
decide
to
work
harder
at
educating
the
public
about
these
complex
and
technical
issues
,
that
hardly
can
be
termed
non-objective
journalism
.

The
environment
can
no
longer
be
a
normal
issue
,
to
be
dealt
with
on
a
business-as-usual
basis
with
comfortable
increments
of
change
.

We
have
literally
altered
the
chemistry
and
physics
of
our
planet
's
atmosphere
.

This
portends
consequences
from
what
we
have
already
done
that
will
be
very
destabilizing
to
social
and
economic
systems
.

The
problems
of
the
environment
are
so
interrelated
,
so
inextricably
entwined
with
our
current
way
of
life
and
so
large
that
it
is
unlikely
we
will
be
able
to
address
them
effectively
unless
major
changes
are
made
in
less
than
10
years
.

The
consensus
from
the
scientific
community
is
that
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
advise
major
policy
changes
.

No
,
we
are
not
overreacting
.

Thomas
E.
Lovejoy
Assistant
Secretary
for
External
Affairs
Smithsonian
Institution
Washington
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
Inc.
,
fulfilling
its
dismal
earnings
forecast
for
1989
,
said
its
third-quarter
net
income
fell
68
%
on
flat
revenue
.

Stung
by
higher
marketing
costs
and
slowing
volume
growth
,
the
giant
Coke
bottling
operation
said
net
fell
to
$
12.7
million
,
or
six
cents
a
share
,
from
$
39.9
million
,
or
26
cents
a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

The
results
met
estimates
of
analysts
,
who
had
already
slashed
their
projections
after
the
company
said
in
late
August
that
its
1989
earnings
could
tumble
as
much
as
37
%
.

A
company
spokesman
said
yesterday
that
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
sticks
by
its
1989
forecast
.

Third-quarter
revenue
was
flat
at
$
1.02
billion
.

The
year-ago
results
,
however
,
included
the
operations
of
a
bottling
business
,
which
was
sold
last
December
.

Excluding
that
bottling
business
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
'
volume
,
measured
by
cases
of
soda
,
rose
only
1
%
.

The
volume
is
well
below
the
industry
's
4
%
to
5
%
growth
rate
of
recent
years
,
but
in
line
with
other
soft-drink
companies
for
the
third
quarter
.

The
latest
third-quarter
volume
also
compares
with
a
very
strong
10
%
growth
in
the
year-ago
quarter
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
blamed
the
lower
volume
on
its
soft-drink
prices
,
which
were
about
3
%
higher
in
the
third
quarter
.

Consumers
have
been
accustomed
to
buying
soft-drinks
at
discounted
prices
for
several
years
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
said
it
had
to
boost
spending
for
trade
and
dealer
incentives
to
try
to
keep
volumes
from
slipping
.

The
company
said
it
expects
consumers
will
adjust
to
higher-priced
soft
drinks
.

A
spokesman
attributed
the
bulk
of
a
14
%
increase
in
selling
,
administrative
and
general
expenses
--
to
$
324.9
million
--
to
marketing
costs
.

``
They
're
out
there
promoting
like
crazy
,
trying
to
get
prices
up
by
promotion
,
''
said
Roy
Burry
,
an
analyst
with
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
'
net
fell
31
%
to
$
65
million
,
or
39
cents
a
share
,
from
$
93.8
million
,
or
63
cents
a
share
.

Revenue
was
flat
at
about
$
2.97
billion
.

Coca-Cola
Enterprises
,
which
is
49%-owned
by
Coca-Cola
Co.
,
also
said
it
repurchased
about
1.2
million
of
its
common
shares
during
the
third
quarter
.

The
buy-back
is
part
of
a
25-million-share
repurchase
plan
,
under
which
Coca-Cola
Enterprises
so
far
has
acquired
a
total
of
9.7
million
shares
.

rose
25
%
to
$

from
$
3.13

The

5.9

from
the
sale
of

L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
is
expected
to
reach
an
agreement
in
principle
this
week
to
sell
Merksamer
Jewelers
Inc.
to
management
,
say
executives
familiar
with
the
talks
.

L.J.
Hooker
,
based
in
Atlanta
,
filed
for
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
earlier
this
year
.

Currently
,
its
parent
company
,
Hooker
Corp.
of
Sydney
,
Australia
,
is
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
liquidator
.

It
is
expected
that
GE
Capital
Corp.
,
a
financial-services
subsidiary
of
General
Electric
Co.
,
will
provide
much
of
the
funding
for
the
proposed
leveraged
buy-out
of
Merksamer
,
based
in
Sacramento
,
Calif
.

A
spokesman
for
GE
Capital
declined
to
comment
.

GE
Capital
has
a
working
relationship
with
L.J.
Hooker
.

It
is
providing
$
50
million
in
emergency
financing
to
the
company
and
has
agreed
to
buy
as
much
as
$
75
million
in
receivables
from
B.
Altman
&
Co.
and
Bonwit
Teller
,
L.J.
Hooker
's
two
fully
owned
department-store
chains
.

Sam
Merksamer
,
chief
executive
officer
of
the
nationwide
jewelry
chain
,
and
Sanford
Sigoloff
,
chief
executive
of
L.J.
Hooker
Corp.
,
both
declined
to
comment
.

Currently
,
Mr.
Merksamer
owns
20
%
of
the
company
;
L.J.
Hooker
acquired
its
80
%
interest
in
the
firm
in
May
1986
.

At
the
time
,
the
Merksamer
chain
had
11
stores
in
operation
.

Today
,
there
are
77
units
,
all
located
in
shopping
malls
.

In
recent
weeks
Mr.
Merksamer
has
approached
a
number
of
his
suppliers
and
asked
them
to
provide
letters
of
intent
saying
they
will
continue
shipping
merchandise
to
the
chain
following
the
buy-out
,
say
those
familiar
with
the
situation
.

This
year
,
a
number
of
retail
leveraged
buyouts
have
failed
,
causing
jitters
among
suppliers
,
and
Mr.
Merksamer
apparently
wanted
assurances
that
he
wo
n't
have
delivery
problems
.

For
the
year
ended
June
30
,
1989
,
Merksamer
Jewelers
had
$
62
million
of
revenue
and
operating
profit
of
$
2.5
million
.

The
jewelery
chain
was
put
up
for
sale
in
June
.

According
to
those
familiar
with
the
situation
,
other
bidders
included
Ratners
Group
PLC
of
London
and
Kay
Jewelers
Inc
.

First
Boston
Corp.
is
advising
L.J.
Hooker
on
the
sale
of
the
Merksamer
business
.

Merksamer
was
the
first
in
a
series
of
retail
acquisitions
made
by
L.J.
Hooker
.

The
company
was
founded
in
Sacramento
in
1929
by
two
brothers
,
Ralph
and
Walter
Merksamer
,
who
operated
as
DeVon
's
Jewelers
.

In
1979
,
the
pair
split
the
company
in
half
,
with
Walter
and
his
son
,
Sam
,
agreeing
to
operate
under
the
Merksamer
Jewelery
name
.

The
sale
of
Merksamer
Jewelers
is
subject
to
approval
by
Judge
Tina
Brozman
of
U.S.
Bankruptcy
Court
.

As
earlier
reported
,
L.J.
Hooker
this
week
received
a
$
409
million
bid
for
its
three
shopping
malls
,
plus
other
properties
from
a
consortium
led
by
Honolulu
real-estate
investor
Jay
Shidler
and
A.
Boyd
Simpson
,
an
Atlanta
developer
and
former
L.J.
Hooker
senior
executive
.

The
offer
,
which
did
n't
include
the
Merksamer
chain
,
is
being
reviewed
by
Mr.
Sigoloff
.

Robert
J.
Regal
was
named
president
and
chief
executive
officer
of
this
company
's
Universal-Rundle
Corp.
unit
.

Mr.
Regal

Mr.

said
that
NBC

president
Brandon
Tartikoff
,
who
declined
to
be
interviewed
,
is
``
looking
at
options
now
and
may
put
some
things
into
the
schedule
by

''
He
declined
to
elaborate
.

NBC
's
options
could
range
from
news-oriented
programming
to
sports
shows
,
although
the
network
declined
to
comment
.

One
major
NBC
affiliate
,
KCRA
in
Sacramento
,
plans
to
cancel
the
NBC
Saturday
morning
line-up
as
of
January
and
replace
it
with
a
local
newscast
.

The
one-hour
program
will
be
repeated
with
updates
throughout
Saturday
mornings
.

``
We
feel
there
is
an
opportunity
for
an
audience
that
is
not
being
served
by
any
network
,
so
we
want
to
take
the
lead
,
''
says
KCRA
's
general
manager
,
John
Kueneke
.

``
We
do
n't
need
cartoons
anymore
.

They
only
accounted
for
5
%
,
at
best
,
of
the
station
's
total
revenues
.

''
An
NBC
spokesman
says
the
network
will
``
closely
monitor
''
the
Sacramento
situation
,
and
says
it
is
the
only
station
to
defect
.

Spokesmen
for
the
television
networks
of
CBS
Inc.
and
Capital
Inc.
,
say
there
are
no
plans
to
alter
the
children
's
line-up
on
Saturday
mornings
.

The
youthful
audience
for
Saturday
programming
is
no
longer
dependent
on
the
networks
.

There
has
been
a
surge
in
syndicated
children
's
shows
to
independent
stations
,
as
well
as
competition
from
videocassettes
for
kids
and
from
cable
outlets
such
as
Nickelodeon
and
the
Disney
Channel
.

At
the
same
time
,
there
appears
to
be
a
market
for
news-oriented
programming
;
Turner
Broadcasting
System
Inc.
's
Cable
News
Network
has
its
highest
ratings
,
outside
of
prime
time
,
on
Saturday
mornings
.

NBC
has
on
previous
occasions
considered
replacing
cartoons
with
a
Saturday
version
of
``
Today
,
''
which
is
produced
by
NBC
News
.

The
network
's
own
production
company
,
NBC
Productions
,
supplies
a
half-hour
family-oriented
show
titled
``
Saved
By
The
Bell
.

''
NBC
Productions
or
NBC
News
could
supply
the
network
with
other
Saturday
morning
shows
,
a
move
that
would
control
costs
.

Animated
shows
,
which
are
made
by
outside
production
companies
,
cost
the
network
about
$
300,000
per
episode
.

Rohm
&
Haas
Co.
said
third-quarter
net
income
skidded
35
%
to
$
32.6
million
,
or
49
cents
a
share
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
the
chemicals
company
had
net
of
$
49.8
million
,
or
75
cents
a

.

Sales
were
$
623

,
up
0.5
%
from
$

a
year
ago
.

Rohm
&
Haas
,
which
plans
to
start
operating
seven
new
production
units
this
year
,
attributed
the
profit
slide
partly
to
higher
start-up
expense
.

The
company
also
cited
the
stronger
dollar
,
which
cuts
the
value
of
overseas
profit
when
it
is
translated
into
dollars
.

In
addition
,
the
company
said
,
it
was
hurt
by
higher
than
previous-year
costs
for
raw
materials
,
though
those
costs
have
declined
since
the
second
quarter
.

Incrementally
higher
production
of
those
chemicals
which
remain
in
heavy
demand
also
has
forced
up
costs
,
such
as
overtime
pay
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Rohm
&

net
totaled
$
155

2.33

This
is
written
to
correct
a
misquotation
in
your
Oct.
3
article
``
Deaths
From
Advanced
Colon
Cancer
Can
Be
Reduced
by
Using
Two
Drugs
.

''
In
this
article
,
I
was
alleged
to
have
said
,
``
Any
patient
with
high-risk
colon
cancer
is
really
getting
short
shrift
if
he
's
not
getting
this
therapy
.

''
I
did
n't
say
this
,
and
I
'm
totally
opposed
to
the
philosophy
expressed
by
the
quote
.

I
have
not
offered
and
will
not
offer
routine
therapy
with
the
two
drugs
,
levamisole
and
5-fluorouracil
,
to
any
of
my
colon-cancer
patients
.

With
this
treatment
we
have
reduced
deaths
in
high-risk
colon
cancer
by
one-third
--
but
this
leaves
the
two-thirds
who
are
dying
of
cancer
.

This
is
not
nearly
good
enough
.

I
believe
any
physician
who
truly
cares
about
cancer
patients
,
both
today
and
tomorrow
,
should
offer
the
hope
of
something
better
than
that
.

My
statement
,
read
verbatim
from
a
printed
text
available
to
all
reporters
attending
the
National
Cancer
Institute
news
conference
,
was
the
following
:
``
New
clinical
trials
are
already
in
operation
seeking
to
improve
these
results
.

These
research
protocols
offer
to
the
patient
not
only
the
very
best
therapy
which
we
have
established
today
but
also
the
hope
of
something
still
better
.

I
feel
any
patient
with
high-risk
cancer
is
getting
short
shrift
if
he
is
not
offered
this
opportunity
.

''
We
have
very
exciting
prospects
for
far
more
impressive
advances
in
the
treatment
of
colon
cancer
during
the
years
immediately
ahead
.

This
hope
,
however
,
will
never
be
realized
if
we
use
levamisole
and
5-fluorouracil
as
a
stopping
point
.

The
oil
and
auto
industries
,
united
in
their
dislike
of
President
Bush
's
proposal
for
cars
that
run
on
alternative
fuels
,
announced
a
joint
research
program
that
could
turn
up
a
cleaner-burning
gasoline
.

Officials
of
the
Big
Three
auto
makers
and
14
petroleum
companies
said
they
are
setting
out
to
find
the
most
cost-effective
fuel
for
reducing
cities
'
air-pollution
problems
,
with
no
bias
toward
any
fuel
in
particular
.

However
,
their
search
notably
wo
n't
include
natural
gas
or
pure
methanol
--
the
two
front-running
alternative
fuels
--
in
tests
to
be
completed
by
next
summer
.

Instead
,
the
tests
will
focus
heavily
on
new
blends
of
gasoline
,
which
are
still
undeveloped
but
which
the
petroleum
industry
has
been
touting
as
a
solution
for
automobile
pollution
that
is
choking
urban
areas
.

Environmentalists
criticized
the
program
as
merely
a
public-relations
attempt
to
head
off
a
White
House
proposal
to
require
a
million
cars
a
year
that
run
on
cleaner-burning
fuels
by
1997
.

While
major
oil
companies
have
been
experimenting
with
cleaner-burning
gasoline
blends
for
years
,
only
Atlantic
Richfield
Co.
is
now
marketing
a
lower-emission
gasoline
for
older
cars
currently
running
on
leaded
fuel
.

The
initial
$
11
million
research
program
will
conduct
the
most
extensive
testing
to
date
of
reformulated
gasolines
,
said
Joe
Colucci
,
head
of
fuels
and
lubricants
at
General
Motors
Corp.
research
laboratories
.

It
will
compare
21
different
blends
of
gasolines
with
three
mixtures
of
up
to
85
%
methanol
.

A
second
phase
of
research
,
which
is
still
being
planned
,
will
test
reformulated
gasolines
on
newer
engine
technologies
now
being
developed
for
use
in
1992
or
1993
cars
.

There
was
no
cost
estimate
for
the
second
phase
.

``
The
whole
idea
here
is
the
automobile
and
oil
companies
have
joint
customers
,
''
said
Keith
McHenry
,
a
senior
vice
president
of
technology
at
Amoco
Corp
.

``
And
we
are
looking
for
the
most
cost-effective
way
to
clean
up
the
air
.

''
But
David
Hawkins
,
an
environmental
lawyer
with
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
,
said
the
research
appears
merely
to
be
a
way
to
promote
reformulated
gasoline
.

Oil
and
auto
companies
supported
a
move
on
Capitol
Hill
last
week
to
gut
Mr.
Bush
's
plans
to
require
auto
makers
to
begin
selling
alternative-fueled
cars
by
1995
.

Instead
,
a
House
subcommittee
adopted
a
clean-fuels
program
that
specifically
mentions
reformulated
gasoline
as
an
alternative
.

The
Bush
administration
has
said
it
will
try
to
resurrect
its
plan
when
the
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
takes
up
a
comprehensive
clean-air
bill
.

William
Seidman
,
chairman
of
the
Federal
Deposit
Insurance
Corp.
,
said
Lincoln
Savings
&
Loan
Association
should
have
been
seized
by
the
government
in
1986
to
contain
losses
that
he
estimated
will
cost
taxpayers
as
much
as
$
2
billion
.

Mr.
Seidman
,
who
has
been
the
nation
's
top
bank
regulator
,
inherited
the
problems
of
Lincoln
,
based
in
Irvine
,
Calif.
,
after
his
regulatory
role
was
expanded
by
the
new
savings-and-loan
bailout
law
.

He
made
his
comments
before
House
Banking
Committee
hearings
to
investigate
what
appears
to
be
the
biggest
thrift
disaster
in
a
scandal-ridden
industry
.

The
inquiry
also
will
cover
the
actions
of
Charles
Keating
Jr.
,
who
is
chairman
of
American
Continental
Corp.
,
Lincoln
's
parent
,
and
who
contributed
heavily
to
several
U.S.
senators
.

Mr.
Seidman
told
the
committee
that
the
Resolution
Trust
Corp.
,
the
agency
created
to
sell
sick
thrifts
,
has
studied
Lincoln
's
examination
reports
by
former
regulators
dating
back
to
1986
.

``
My
staff
indicated
that
had
we
made
such
findings
in
one
of
our
own
institutions
,
we
would
have
sought
an
immediate
cease-and-desist
order
to
stop
the
hazardous
operations
,
''
Mr.
Seidman
said
.

When
Lincoln
was
seized
by
the
government
,
for
example
,
15
%
of
its
loans
,
or
$
250
million
,
were
to
borrowers
who
were
buying
real
estate
from
one
of
American
Continental
's
50
other
subsidiaries
,
according
to
Mr.
Seidman
.

But
the
government
did
n't
step
in
until
six
months
ago
,
when
thrift
officials
put
Lincoln
into
conservatorship
--
the
day
after
American
Continental
filed
for
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
from
creditors
.

The
bankruptcy
filing
,
the
government
has
charged
in
a
$
1.1
billion
civil
lawsuit
,
was
part
of
a
pattern
to
shift
insured
deposits
to
the
parent
company
,
which
used
the
deposits
as
a
cache
for
real-estate
deals
.

The
deposits
that
have
been
transferred
to
other
subsidiaries
are
now
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
.

``
I
think
it
's
fairly
clear
{
Mr.
Keating
}
knew
,
''
that
regulators
were
set
to
seize
Lincoln
,
Mr.
Seidman
said
.

Further
investigation
,
he
said
,
may
result
in
further
actions
against
Lincoln
's
executives
,
said
Mr.
Seidman
,
``
including
fraud
actions
.

''
Mr.
Keating
,
for
his
part
,
has
filed
suit
alleging
that
regulators
unlawfully
seized
the
thrift
.

Leonard
Bickwit
,
an
attorney
in
Washington
for
Mr.
Keating
,
declined
to
comment
on
the
hearings
,
except
to
say
,
``
We
will
be
responding
comprehensively
in
several
forums
to
each
of
these
allegations
at
the
appropriate
time
.

''
Lincoln
's
treatment
by
former
thrift
regulators
,
in
an
agency
disbanded
by
the
new
law
,
has
proved
embarrassing
for
five
senators
who
received
thousands
of
dollars
in
campaign
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
.

Mr.
Seidman
said
yesterday
,
for
example
,
that
Sen.
Dennis
DeConcini
(
D.
,
Ariz.
)
,
who
received
$
48,100
in
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
,
phoned
Mr.
Seidman
to
request
that
he
push
for
a
sale
of
Lincoln
before
it
would
be
seized
.

After
the
government
lawsuit
was
filed
against
Lincoln
,
Sen.
DeConcini
returned
the
campaign
contributions
.

The
senator
's
spokesman
said
yesterday
that
he
pushed
for
the
sale
of
Lincoln
because
``
hundreds
of
Arizona
jobs
{
at
Lincoln
}
were
on
the
line
.

''
Senate
Banking
Committee
Chairman
Donald
Riegle
(
D.
,
Mich
.

)
has
also
returned
contributions
he
received
from
Mr.
Keating
a
year
ago
.

Sens.
John
Glenn
(
D.
,
Ohio
)
,
John
McCain
,
(
R.
,
Ariz.
)
and
Alan
Cranston
(
D.
,
Calif.
)
also
received
substantial
contributions
from
Mr.
Keating
and
sought
to
intervene
on
behalf
of
Lincoln
.

House
Banking
Committee
Chairman
Henry
Gonzalez
(
D.
,
Texas
)
said
Sen.
Cranston
volunteered
to
appear
before
the
House
committee
,
if
necessary
.

But
a
committee
staff
member
said
the
panel
is
unlikely
to
pursue
closely
the
role
of
the
senators
.

At
the
hearing
,
Mr.
Seidman
said
the
RTC
has
already
pumped
$
729
million
into
Lincoln
for
liquidity
.

He
also
held
out
little
hope
of
restitution
for
purchasers
of
$
225
million
in
American
Continental
subordinated
debt
.

Some
of
those
debtholders
have
filed
a
suit
,
saying
they
believed
they
were
buying
government-insured
certificates
of
deposit
.

``
We
have
no
plans
at
this
time
to
pay
off
those
notes
,
''
he
said
.

Eastern
Airlines
'
creditors
committee
,
unhappy
with
the
carrier
's
plans
for
emerging
from
bankruptcy-law
proceedings
,
asked
its
own
experts
to
devise
alternate
approaches
to
a
reorganization
.

Representatives
of
the
accounting
firm
of
Ernst
&
Young
and
the
securities
firm
of
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
,
hired
by
creditors
to
consult
on
Eastern
's
financial
plans
,
told
the
committee
in
a
private
meeting
yesterday
that
Eastern
's
latest
plan
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy-law
protection
is
far
riskier
than
an
earlier
one
which
won
the
creditors
'
approval
.

According
to
one
person
present
at
the
meeting
,
Eastern
's
new
plan
is
financially
``
overly
optimistic
.

''
Asked
about
the
consultants
'
reports
,
an
Eastern
spokeswoman
said
``
we
totally
disagree

''
She
said
they
have
``
oversimplified

made
some
erroneous
assumptions
that
make
their
analysis
completely
off-base

chairman
of
Eastern
's
parent
Texas
Air
Corp.
,
said
Eastern
was
exceeding
its
goals
for
getting
back
into
operation
and
predicted
it
would
emerge
from
Chapter
11
protection
from
creditors
early
next
year
,
operating
with
more
service
than
it
originally
had
scheduled
.

He
insisted
,
as
he
has
before
,
that
creditors
would
be
paid
in
full
under
the
plan
.

Mr.
Lorenzo
made
no
mention
of
creditors
'
negative
response
to
his
plan
.

``
We
're
in
the
process
of
discussing
an
amended
plan
with
the
creditors
and
anticipate
filing
that
amended
plan
shortly
,
''
Mr.
Lorenzo
told
reporters
.

``
We
're
meeting
and
surpassing
our
goals
,
''
he
added
.

In
July
,
Eastern
and
its
creditors
agreed
on
a
reorganization
plan
that
called
for
Eastern
to
sell
$
1.8
billion
in
assets
and
to
emerge
from
bankruptcy-law
protection
at
two-thirds
its
former
size
.

But
after
selling
off
pieces
such
as
its
East
Coast
shuttle
,
its
Philadelphia
hub
and
various
planes
,
Eastern
hit
a
stumbling
block
.

It
could
n't
sell
its
South
American
routes
,
one
of
the
major
assets
marked
for
disposal
.

Those
routes
,
valued
by
the
creditors
'
professionals
at
about
$
400
million
,
were
to
be
sold
to
AMR
Corp.
's
American
Airlines
.

A
last-minute
snag
in
negotiations
with
AMR
,
over
an
unrelated
lawsuit
between
American
and
another
Texas
Air
unit
,
caused
the
deal
to
collapse
.

Eastern
ultimately
decided
it
would
have
to
keep
and
operate
the
routes
itself
,
which
would
leave
it
with
less
cash
for
its
reorganization
.

It
also
would
leave
Eastern
a
bigger
carrier
than
the
scaled-down
one
proposed
under
the
initial
plan
.

Those
changes
in
its
condition
meant
the
reorganization
plan
previously
presented
to
creditors
would
have
to
be
revamped
.

Since
then
,
Eastern
has
been
negotiating
with
creditors
over
revisions
,
but
the
creditors
committee
has
been
having
problems
with
the
revisions
.

The
committee
has
two
groups
of
experts
it
calls
on
to
analyze
Eastern
's
plans
.

Both
said
the
new
plan
would
n't
work
.

Ernst
&
Young
said
Eastern
's
plans
will
miss
its
projections
of
earnings
before
interest
,
tax
and
depreciation
by
$
100
million
,
and
that
Eastern
's
plan
presented
no
comfort
level
,
according
to
a
source
present
at
yesterday
's
session
.

Experts
from
Goldman
Sachs
estimated
Eastern
would
miss
the
same
mark
by
$
120
million
to
$
135
million
,
the
source
said
.

The
experts
said
they
expected
Eastern
would
have
to
issue
new
debt
to
cover
its
costs
,
and
that
it
would
generate
far
less
cash
than
anticipated
.

Other
costs
also
would
increase
,
including
maintenance
,
because
Eastern
has
an
older
fleet
.

At
the
news
conference
,
Mr.
Lorenzo
and
Eastern
President
Phil
Bakes
presented
a
far
rosier
assessment
.

Flanked
by
flight
attendants
,
pilots
and
gate
agents
dressed
in
spiffy
new
blue
uniforms
,
they
said
Eastern
has
exceeded
its
operational
goals
and
is
filling
its
seats
.

Starting
next
month
,
Eastern
will
begin
flying
775
flights
daily
instead
of
the
previously
announced
700
,
they
said
.

Mr.
Bakes
declined
to
give
out
Eastern
's
daily
losses
,
but
said
he
did
n't
expect
Eastern
would
have
to
dip
into
the
cash
from
asset
sales
currently
held
in
escrow
.

These
accounts
hold
several
hundred
million
dollars
,
primarily
from
asset
sales
.

The
plan
Eastern
hopes
to
pursue
,
he
said
,
calls
for
Eastern
to
have
$
390
million
in
cash
by
year
's
end
.

Both
he
and
Mr.
Lorenzo
predicted
that
plan
might
be
confirmed
in
January
.

As
to
negotiations
with
creditors
,
Mr.
Lorenzo
said
in
remarks
after
the
conference
``
we
'll
have
to
see
how
they
{
talks
}
come
along
.

''
However
,
he
added
,
``
it
's
not
a
requirement
that
the
plan
be
accepted
by
creditors
.

It
must
be
accepted
by
the
court
.

''
Under
bankruptcy
law
,
Eastern
has
exclusive
rights
for
a
certain
period
to
develop
its
own
reorganization
plan
.

That
deadline
has
been
extended
once
and
could
be
extended
again
.

If
Eastern
can
get
creditor
support
,
court
confirmation
of
its
plan
could
be
relatively
swift
.

But
creditors
are
free
to
press
for
court
approval
of
their
own
plan
,
or
the
court
could
ignore
both
sides
and
draw
its
own
.

In
any
event
,
some
people
familiar
with
the
case
question
whether
the
court
will
act
by
January
as
forecast
by
Mr.
Lorenzo
and
Mr.
Bakes
.

Eastern
sought
bankruptcy-law
protection
a
few
days
after
a
crippling
strike
began
March
4
.

Mr.
Lorenzo
told
reporters
the
reorganization
Eastern
is
pursuing
would
create
a
carrier
85
%
to
90
%
of
the
size
of
the
pre-bankruptcy
Eastern
.

He
projected
it
would
be
operating
about
1,000
flights
a
day
by
late
spring
,
only
slightly
fewer
than
the
carrier
's
old
volume
of
1,050
a
day
.

HOPES
OF
SIMPLIFYING
the
corporate
minimum
tax
before
1990
are
weakening
.

The
method
of
calculating
the
20
%
tax
,
paid
if
it
exceeds
tax
figured
the
regular
way
,
is
due
for
a
change
in
1990
,
thanks
to
1986
's
tax
act
.

But
most
experts
agree
that
the
concept
that
is
to
be
introduced
drags
in
great
complexity
;
they
have
been
trying
to
head
it
off
this
year
.

Ways
and
Means
Chairman
Rostenkowski
backed
a
simplification
plan
in
the
pending
House
tax
bill
,
but
the
plan
turns
out
to
be
a
big
revenue
loser
.

Now
the
Senate
's
stripped-down
bill
omits
any
proposal
to
deal
with
the
corporate
tax
.

Proponents
of
simplification
fear
that
the
chances
of
getting
it
into
the
final
bill
are
waning
.

``
We
hear
it
has
low
priority
on
the
House
side
,
''
says
Samuel
Starr
of
Coopers
&
Lybrand
,
CPAs
.

If
the
law
is
n't
changed
,
he
says
,
``
we
are
left
staring
at
rules
that
are
almost
impossible
to
implement
,
because
there
are
so
many
complex
depreciation
calculations
to
do
.

''
But
Congress
still
could
resolve
the
issue
with
other
legislation
this
year
or
next
,
Starr
adds
.

HUGO
'S
RAVAGES
may
be
offset
by
immediate
claims
for
tax
refunds
.

This
law
aids
hurricane-wracked
locales
named
by
the
president
as
disaster
areas
,
as
well
as
regions
so
designated
after
other
1989
disasters
.

It
lets
victims
elect
to
deduct
casualty
losses
on
either
1989
or
amended
1988
returns
,
whichever
offers
the
larger
tax
benefit
;
they
have
until
April
16
to
choose
.

Amending
a
1988
return
to
claim
a
refund
brings
cash
faster
;
but
for
personal
losses
,
there
are
other
factors
to
consider
,
notes
publisher
Prentice
Hall
.

A
loss
--
after
insurance
recoveries
--
is
deductible
only
to
the
extent
that
it
exceeds
$
100
and
that
the
year
's
total
losses
exceed
10
%
of
adjusted
gross
income
;
victims
may
pick
the
year
when
income
is
lower
and
deductions
higher
.

In
filing
an
original
(
not
amended
)
return
,
a
couple
should
consider
whether
damaged
property
is
owned
jointly
or
separately
and
whether
one
spouse
has
larger
income
;
that
may
determine
whether
they
should
file
jointly
or
separately
.

THE
IRS
DELAYS
several
deadlines
for
Hugo
's
victims
.

Returns
for
1988
from
people
with
six-month
filing
extensions
were
due
Monday
,
but
the
IRS
says
people
in
the
disaster
areas
wo
n't
be
penalized
for
late
filing
if
their
returns
are
marked
``
Hugo
''
and
postmarked
by
Jan.
16
.

Interest
will
be
imposed
on
unpaid
taxes
,
but
late-payment
penalties
on
the
returns
will
be
waived
if
the
balance
due
and
paid
is
10
%
or
less
of
the
liability
.

BIGGER
THAN
A
BREADBOX
was
this
cash
hoarder
's
reputation
for
honesty
.

People
often
cite
frugality
and
distrust
of
banks
to
justify
cash
caches
to
the
IRS
.

Gregory
Damonne
Brown
of
Fremont
,
Calif.
,
a
hardworking
,
reclusive
young
bachelor
,
told
that
story
to
the
Tax
Court
.

But
judges
usually
find
the
real
aim
is
to
escape
tax
on
hidden
income
;
and
the
IRS
said
Brown
must
have
had
such
income
--
although
it
uncovered
no
source
--
because
he
deposited
$
124,732
in
a
bank
account
in
1982-84
while
reporting
income
of
only
$
52,012
.

Brown
's
story
:
The
deposits
came
from
savings
kept
in
a
Tupperware
breadbox
;
he
saved
$
47,000
in
1974-81
by
living
with
family
members
and
pinching
pennies
and
$
45,000
of
secret
gifts
from
his
remorseful
father
,
who
had
abandoned
the
family
in
1955
.

Brown
had
no
proof
;
but
testimony
of
his
mother
and
stepmother
about
his
father
and
of
an
ex-employer
about
his
honesty
and
habits
satisfied
a
judge
that
Brown
was
truthful
and
his
tale
of
gifts
was
possible
.

The
IRS
offered
no
evidence
of
hidden
sources
of
taxable
income
,
so
Judge
Shields
rejected
its
claims
.

BRIEFS
:
Asked
how
he
made
charitable
gifts
of
$
26,350
out
of
reported
two-year
income
of
$
46,892
,
Thomas
H.
McFall
of
Bryan
,
Texas
,
told
the
Tax
Court
he
had
understated
his
income
.

The
court
rejected
his
incredible
claims
,
denied
his
deductions
,
and
imposed
a
negligence
penalty
...

Rep.
Schaefer
(

Peterson
mounts

bicycle

grinds
up
yet
another

rocky
path
seemingly
suitable

After
a
tortuous
climb
,
she
is
rewarded
by
a
picture-postcard
vista
:
a
glade
of
golden
aspens
under
an
azure
Indian-summer
sky
.

This
place
is
12
miles
into
the
back
country
--
a
day-long
trudge
for
a
hiker
,
but
reached
by
Ms.
Peterson
and
six
others
in
a
mere
two
hours
of
pedaling
fat-tired
mountain
bikes
.

``
This

''
says
Ms.
Peterson
,
``
is
what
it
's
all
about

''
Twelve
hundred
miles
away
,
rangers
at
a
Napa
County
,
Calif.
,
state
park
are
among
the
many
who
do
n't
quite
share
the
enthusiasm
.

This
summer
,
speeding
bikers
were
blamed
for
an
accident
in
the
Napa
County
park
,
in
which
a
horse
--
spooked
on
a
trail
that
was
closed
to
bikers
--
broke
its
leg
.

The
animal
had
to
be
destroyed
;
the
bikers
fled
and
were
never
found
.

In
numerous
parks
near
San
Francisco
,
rangers
have
been
forced
to
close
trails
,
set
up
speed
traps
and
use
radar
guns
to
curb
fast
and
reckless
riding
.

They
have
even
sent
helicopters
in
pursuit
of
bikers
after
hikers
and
equestrians
complained
they
were
being
driven
from
trails
.

``
We
were
being
overrun
,
''
says
Steve
Fiala
,
trails
coordinator
of
the
East
Bay
Regional
Park
District
.

Two
years
ago
,
the
district
decided
to
limit
the
bikes
to
fire
roads
in
its
65,000
hilly
acres
.

From
about
200,000
six
years
ago
,
the
number
of
mountain
bikes
in
the
U.S.
is
expected
to
grow
to
10
million
in
1990
.

At
least
half
that
growth
will
have
come
in
the
past
three
years
alone
.

The
controversy
kicked
up
by
the
proliferation
of
these
all-terrain
bicycles
is
one
of
the
most
divisive
storms
to
blow
through
the
national
conservation
movement
in
recent
memory
.

Bikers
--
many
of
them
ardent
environmentalists
--
proclaim
their
sport
an
efficient
,
safe
,
fitness-promoting
way
to
get
back
to
nature
,
while
asserting
a
right
,
as
taxpayers
,
to
pedal
on
public
lands
.

But
the
bikes
'
burgeoning
numbers
,
safety
concerns
and
fear
that
they
damage
fragile
landscapes
have
prompted
pleas
,
from
the
Sierras
to
the
Eastern
Seaboard
,
to
ban
them
from
the
back
country
.

Key
to
the
issue
is
that
the
bikes
,
in
skillful
hands
,
can
go
virtually
anywhere
,
and
in
reckless
hands
can
become
vehicles
of
terror
.

An
adept
bicyclist
can
leap
from
a
dead
stop
to
the
top
of
a
picnic
table
without
losing
balance
.

Such
skills
allow
riders
to
fly
down
treacherous
mountain
grades
at
speeds
of
up
to
40
miles
an
hour
--
a
thrill
for
the
cyclist
but
a
nightmare
for
unsuspecting
hikers
or
equestrians
.

For
harried
public-land
managers
across
the
nation
,
the
response
is
increasingly
to
shut
the
gates
.

The
state
of
California
,
following
the
lead
of
some
regional
parks
,
recently
adopted
regulations
that
closed
nearly
all
hiking
paths
in
state
parks
to
mountain
bicycles
.

The
move
largely
consigns
them
to
roads
used
by
motorized
vehicles
.

Most
other
states
have
enacted
similar
bans
.

The
bikes
are
unwelcome
on
trails
in
national
parks
.

Even
the
U.S.
Forest
Service
,
whose
lenient
``
multiple-use
''
philosophy
permits
motorized
vehicles
on
thousands
of
miles
of
its
trails
across
the
U.S.
,
has
begun
to
close
some
lands
to
the
bikes
,
including
major
portions
of
the
popular
Pacific
Crest
Trail
,
which
stretches
from
California
to
Canada
.

Often
these
closings
come
after
vigorous
anti-bike
lobbying
by
conservation
organizations
,
the
politically
potent
Sierra
Club
among
them
.

Sierra
has
been
instrumental
in
securing
a
number
of
the
California
bans
.

It
has
been
waging
an
all-out
campaign
to
beat
back
a
proposal
,
pushed
by
Utah
bike
groups
,
to
allow
the
cycles
in
federally
designated
wilderness
areas
,
where
they
are
now
prohibited
.

Yet
Sierra
's
hard-line
stance
has
created
something
of
a
rift
in
the
organization
,
which
estimates
that
17
%
of
its
500,000
members
own
mountain
bikes
.

Pressure
from
these
members
prompted
the
club
recently
to
soften
its
anti-bike
rhetoric
;
it
no
longer
,
for
example
,
lumps
the
bikes
into
the
same
category
as
motorcycles
and
other
terrain-marring
off-road
vehicles
.

But
the
club
still
insists
that
public
lands
ought
to
be
closed
to
the
bikes
unless
studies
indicate
the
bikes
wo
n't
injure
the
environment
or
other
users
.

``
I
have
a
mountain
bike
,
yet
as
a
hiker
I
've
been
run
off
the
road
by
kids
careening
down
a
fire
trail
on
them
,
''
says
Gene
Coan
,
an
official
at
Sierra
's
headquarters
in
San
Francisco
,
echoing
the
concerns
of
many
members
.

``
People
who
feel
that
cyclists
should
be
banned
from
an
area
are
n't
looking
at
the
whole
picture
,
''
complains
Mark
Langton
,
associate
editor
of
Mountain
and
City
Biking
magazine
in
Canoga
Park
,
Calif
.

Mr.
Langton
is
among
the
legions
of
bikers
who
got
their
first
taste
of
wilderness
as
hikers
or
backpackers
.

He
says
fellow
bikers
show
the
same
concern
for
the
land
that
they
demonstrated
as
hikers
;
many
are
appalled
that
the
conservation
community
would
suddenly
consider
them
the
enemy
.

To
fight
back
,
activists
such
as
Mr.
Langton
are
forming
groups
to
lobby
land
managers
over
access
issues
and
undertake
education
programs
to
show
that
the
bikes
can
responsibly
share
trails
.

Mr.
Langton
's
group
,
Concerned
Off-Road
Bicyclists
Association
,
mounted
petition
drives
to
help
keep
open
certain
Santa
Monica
Mountain
trails
designated
for
closing
.

Biking
groups
in
Montana
,
Idaho
,
Michigan
and
Massachusetts
have
won
similar
concessions
,
says
Tim
Blumenthal
,
mountain
bike
editor
of
Bicycling
magazine
.

These
groups
have
been
trying
to
improve
the
mountain
biker
's
image
;
in
the
San
Francisco-area
park
district
where
a
ranger
was
clobbered
by
a
cyclist
this
summer
bikers
have
formed
a
volunteer
patrol
to
help
rangers
enforce
regulations
,
and
to
school
riders
in
proper
trail
etiquette
.

Even
staunch
anti-bike
Sierra
members
concede
that
10
%
of
all
riders
cause
most
of
the
problems
.

While
some
are
renegade
riders
who
simply
scorn
regulations
,
much
bad
riding
simply
reflects
ignorance
that
can
be
corrected
through
``
education
and
peer
pressure
,
''
says
Jim
Hasenauer
,
a
director
of
the
International
Mountain
Biking
Association
.

``
I
think
we
're
making
progress
.

''
Few
would
have
foreseen
such
a
furor
when
,
a
decade
ago
,
some
Marin
County
bicycle
enthusiasts
created
a
hybrid
bike
using
fat
tires
,
lightweight
metallurgy
and
multi-gear
technology
.

They
wanted
a
machine
that
would
allow
them
to
pedal
into
rugged
terrain
then
inaccessible
to
cycles
.

They
got
a
machine
more
responsive
,
more
stable
and
in
many
ways
easier
to
ride
than
the
thin-tired
racing
bikes
that
then
were
the
rage
.

When
the
bikes
first
entered
mass
production
in
1981
,
they
were
dismissed
as
a
fad
.

Last
year
,
25
%
of
the
10
million
bicycles
sold
in
the
U.S.
were
mountain
bikes
.

In
California
,
a
bellwether
market
,
they
accounted
for
more
than
80
%
of
all
bike
sales
.

The
majority
of
the
bikes
never
even
make
it
into
the
high
country
.

City
dwellers
love
them
because
they
shift
smoothly
in
traffic
,
bounce
easily
over
curbs
and
roll
through
road
glass
with
far
fewer
flat
tires
than
racing
bikes
.

Crested
Butte
,
population
1,200
,
is
a
bastion
of
the
sport
.

By
one
estimate
,
everyone
here
under
50
owns
at
least
one
bike
.

The
town
is
home
to
the
Mountain
Bike
Hall
of
Fame
and
it
hosts
the
annual
Fat
Tire
Bike
Week
.

This
summer
,
the
jamboree
attracted
more
visitors
than
the
busiest
week
of
the
town
's
winter
ski
season
.

David
Lindsey
,
chairman
of
the
Fat
Tire
Bike
celebration
,
muses
that
the
bike
's
popularity
may
be
a
combination
of
technology
and
nostalgia
.

``
The
mountain
bike
feels
as
comfortable
as
the
`
paperboy
'
bike
you
had
as
a
kid
,
but
it
can
do
so
much
more
,
''
he
says
.

Stock-market
tremors
again
shook
bond
prices
,
while
the
dollar
turned
in
a
mixed
performance
.

Early
yesterday
,
investors
scrambled
to
buy
Treasury
bonds
for
safety
as
stock
prices
plummeted
and
fears
mounted
of
a
replay
of
Friday
.

But
stocks
later
recovered
,
erasing
most
of
their
early
declines
.

That
cut
short
the
rally
in
Treasury
bonds
and
depressed
prices
moderately
below
late
Monday
's
levels
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
down
more
than
60.25
points
early
in
the
day
,
finished
18.65
points
lower
at
2638.73
.

Long-term
Treasury
issues
declined
about
half
a
point
,
or
$
5
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

``
The
stock
market
clearly
is
leading
the
bond
markets
,
''
said
Jack
Conlon
,
an
executive
vice
president
at
Nikko
Securities
.

``
People
are
breathing
a
major
sigh
of
relief
that
the
world
did
n't
end
Monday
morning
''
or
yesterday
.

Gold
,
a
closely
watched
barometer
of
investor
anxiety
,
was
little
changed
.

The
dollar
initially
fell
against
other
major
currencies
on
news
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
surged
in
August
to
$
10.77
billion
.

But
the
dollar
later
rebounded
,
finishing
slightly
higher
against
the
yen
although
slightly
lower
against
the
mark
.

Federal
Reserve
officials
sent
another
signal
of
their
determination
to
shore
up
investor
confidence
.

In
an
apparent
attempt
to
keep
a
lid
on
short-term
interest
rates
,
the
Fed
once
again
pumped
money
into
the
banking
system
.

But
the
Fed
move
was
a
small
gesture
,
traders
said
.

Fed
officials
appear
reluctant
to
ease
their
credit
grip
any
further
because
a
bold
move
does
n't
appear
necessary
,
several
investment
managers
said
.

The
Fed
has
allowed
a
key
short-term
interest
rate
to
decline
about
one-quarter
percentage
point
.

The
federal
funds
rate
on
overnight
loans
between
banks
has
been
hovering
around
8
%
,
down
from
9
%
previously
.

Although
stocks
have
led
bonds
this
week
,
some
traders
predict
that
relationship
will
reverse
during
the
next
few
weeks
.

Nikko
's
Mr.
Conlon
fears
a
huge
wave
of
Treasury
borrowing
early
next
month
will
drive
down
Treasury
bond
prices
.

That
,
coupled
with
poor
third-quarter
corporate-earnings
comparisons
,
``
will
make
trouble
for
the
equity
market
for
the
next
two
to
three
months
,
''
he
says
.

But
several
other
traders
contend
investors
have
overreacted
to
junk-bond
jitters
,
and
that
stock
prices
will
continue
to
recover
.

``
They
shot
the
whole
orchestra
just
because
the
piano
player
hit
a
bad
note
,
''
said
Laszlo
Birinyi
,
president
of
Birinyi
Associates
Inc.
,
referring
to
the
stock
market
's
plunge
Friday
on
news
of
trouble
in
financing
the
UAL
Corp
.

buy-out
.

In
major
market
activity
:
Treasury
bond
prices
fell

The

on
30-year
Treasury
bonds
climbed
back
above
8
%
,
ending
the
day
at
8.03
%
.

The
dollar
was
mixed
.

Late
yesterday
in
New
York
,
the
dollar
rose
to
142.75
yen
from
141.80
yen
Monday
,
but
fell
to
1.8667

a
15
%
jump
in
third-quarter
net
income
to
$
166.8
million
,
or
78
cents

In
the
1988
third
quarter
,
the
forest-products
company
reported
profit
of
$
144.9
million
,
or
69
cents

Sales
rose
9
%
to
$
2.57

For

rise
in

to

Results
for

include
a
pretax
loss
of
$
33

and
a

Forest-products
operations
strengthened
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
paper
operations
were
dogged
by
higher
costs
,
soft
newsprint
exports
and
a
strong
Japanese
yen
.

Some
competing
forest-products
firms
have
recently
reported
improved
results
due
to
strong
pulp
and
paper
business
.

Weyerhaeuser
's
pulp
and
paper
operations
were
up
for
the
nine
months
,
but
full-year
performance
depends
on
the
balance

Looking

the

said
export
log

lumber
markets

be
weak

Bankers
Trust
New
York
Corp.
became
the
latest
major
U.S.
bank
to
increase
reserves
for
its
loans
to
less-developed
countries
,
making
a
$
1.6
billion
third-quarter
addition
to
its
provision
.

The
bank
also
said
it
expects
to
report
a
$
1.42
billion
loss
for
the
third
quarter
and
a
loss
for
the
full

The
new
reserves
bring
the

James

in
approving
of
the
move
.

Bankers

``
has
had
the
capacity

do
this
for

time
,
''
the
analyst
said
.

He
expects
Citicorp
to
take
a
similar
step
this
year
.

Citicorp
yesterday
reported
a
9
%
third-quarter
earnings
drop
,
which
analysts
called
a
bit
disappointing
,
while
Manufacturers
Hanover
Corp.
posted
a
$
789
million
loss
for
the
quarter
after
adding
$
950
million
to
its
reserve
for
loans
to
less-developed
countries
.

Three
other
major
U.S.
banks
posted
earnings
increases
.

Wells
Fargo
&
Co.
of
San
Francisco
posted
a
17
%
jump
.

PNC
Financial
Corp.
,
the
parent
of
Pittsburgh
National

,
reported
net
income
climbed
9.8
%
,
while
net
for
Banc
One
Corp.
of
Columbus
,
Ohio
,
grew
3.8
%

Citicorp
Analysts
were
only
slightly
disappointed
by
Citicorp
's
numbers
.

``
There
's
nothing
in
here
that
's
horrible

nothing
to
make
you

analyst
for
C.J.
Lawrence

Morgan

Earnings
from

``
The
consumer
business
continues

''
said
Mr.

of
Keefe

Bruyette

Woods
.

Corporate
finance
and
trading
results
in
member
countries
of
the
Organization
for
Economic
Cooperation
and
Development
were
``
relatively
flat
,
sometimes
choppy
,
''
the
bank
said
,
and
profit
for
the
area
sank
27
%
.

The
cross-border
loan
portfolio
reflected
``
adjustment
problems
and
episodic
payment
patterns
,
''
the
bank
said
no
interest
payments
from
Argentina
in
the
nine
months
and
none
from
Brazil
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
Venezuela
brought
itself
``
substantially
current
.

''
Overall
,
the
portfolio
narrowed
its
quarterly
loss
to
$
70
million
from
$
80
million
a
year
earlier
.

``
People
were
waiting
to
see
if
we
would
take
an
additional
provision
''
for
medium-term
and
long-term
loans
to
less-developed
countries
,
a
Citicorp
spokesman
said
.

But
he
reiterated
the
bank
's
position
that
it
is
comfortable
with
the
current
level
of
$
2.6
billion
,
covering
about
30
%
of
the
$
8.9
billion
of
such
loans
outstanding
.

Ronald
I.
Mandle
,
analyst
at
Sanford
C.
Bernstein
&
Co.
,
called
Citicorp
's
venture-capital
gains
of
$
93
million
before
taxes
``
strong
.

''
A
``
concerning
''
item
the
analyst
cited
was
the
10
%
jump
in
expenses
,
which
the
bank
attributes
to
costs
of
expanding
both
its
consumer
credit-card
operations
and
its
overseas
branch
business
.

Citicorp
's
spokesman
said
,
however
,
that
the
bank
is
maintaining
those
expenses
in
proportion
to
revenue
growth
.

Wells
Fargo
Wells
Fargo
continued
to
generate
one
of
the
highest
profit
margins
among
major
banks
,
minimizing
a
drop
in
net
interest
margin
with
13
%
third-quarter
growth
in
high-yielding
business
loans
and
similar
growth
in
mortgages
.

Its
margin
fell
only
seven
basis
points
,
or
of
a
percentage
point
,
from
a
year
ago
,
compared
with
a
13-point
drop
at
Security
Pacific
Corp.
and
much
larger
declines
among
banks
in
other
parts
of
the
country
.

As
a
result
,
Wells
Fargo
's
net
interest
income
rose
$
36.3
million
,
or
7
%
,
to
$
537
million
for
the
quarter
.

Non-interest
income
fell
slightly
to
$
191.9
million
from
$
193.3
million
,
while
Wells
Fargo
continued
to
rigorously
control
non-interest
expense
,
which
was
almost
flat
at
$
393.4
million
.

The
combination
of
solid
loan
growth
with
tight
expense
control
gave
Wells
Fargo
a
1.25
%
return
on
average
assets
for
the
quarter
,
about
40
%
higher
than
Security
Pacific
's
and
a
profit
ratio
matched
by
only
two
or
three
other
major
banks
in
the
U.S
.

Wells
Fargo
's
return
on
equity
increased
to
24.4
%
from
23.8
%
.

Wells
Fargo
has
sold
all
of
its
non-trade
loans
made
to
less-developed
countries
,
and
managed
to
partly
reverse
the
sharp
rise
in
domestic
non-accrual
loans
,
which
fell
8
%
from
the
previous
quarter
to
$
806.8
million
from
$
880.9
million
.

But
the
amount
was
still
39
%
higher
than
the
year-ago
level
,
and
25
%
higher
as
a
percentage
of
total
loans
.

That
trend
,
and
Wells
Fargo
's
heavy
exposure
to
leveraged
buy-outs
,
are
about
the
only
worries
analysts
have
about
Wells
Fargo
's
financial
picture
.

Wells
Fargo
is
rebuilding
its
loan-loss
reserve
,
which
increased
to
$
711
million
at
Sept.
30
from
$
664
million
the
previous
quarter
but
was
down
from
$
852
million
a
year
ago
,
when
the
bank
still
had
some
shaky
foreign
loans
.

Manufacturers
Hanover
Manufacturers
Hanover
said
that
excluding
the
addition
to
its
reserves
,
certain
tax
benefits
,
and
a
one-time
$
16
million
gain
on
the
sale
of
an
interest
in
a
foreign
leasing
company
,
third-quarter
earnings
were
$
75
million
.

The
comparable
year-earlier
number
was
$
56
million
,
a
spokesman
said
.

The
bank
's
additional
provisions
brought
reserves
for
loans
to
less-developed
countries
to
$
2.4
billion
,
covering
36
%
of
its
medium
and
long-term
loans
outstanding
to
these
nations
.

The
net
interest
margin
-
the
difference
between
the
bank
's
cost
of
funds
and
what
it
receives
as
interest
payments
--
improved
in
the
quarter
,
as
did
certain
areas
of
wholesale
banking
.

Fees
from
syndicating
loans
dropped
48
%
,
to
$
21
million
.

``
We
did
n't
take
part
in
a
lot
of
deals
''
in
the
quarter
``
because
their
credit
quality
was
poor
,
''
the
spokesman
said
.

Expenses
unrelated
to
interest
rose
5.4
%
,
to
$
541
million
.

PNC
Financial
PNC
Financial
cited
higher
income
from
sources
unrelated
to
interest
and
said
it
continues
to
cut
costs
.

Net
interest
income
in
the
third
quarter
edged
up
1.4
%
,
to
$
317.7
million
.

Trust
income
grew
15
%
,
to
$
49.9
million
,
while
service
charges
,
fees
and
commissions
increased
22
%
,
to
$
79.4
million
.

The
bank
's
total
allowance
for
credit
losses
was
$
502.1
million
,
or
1.82
%
of
total
loans
.

Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
set
a
date
next
month
for
general
elections
that
some
analysts
say
could
cost
him
and
his
ruling
Congress
(
I
)
Party
control
of
the
government
.

Other
analysts
say
the
Indian
leader
could
retain
control
with
a
slim
majority
or
be
forced
to
rule
as
the
dominant
partner
in
a
coalition
with
other
parties
.

Elections
in
this
large
,
diverse
and
passionate
nation
are
always
hard
to
predict
.

Much
depends
on
the
opposition
,
a
loose
group
of
regional
and
ideological
parties
led
by
former
Gandhi
cabinet
minister
Vishwanath
Pratap
Singh
.

The
biggest
certainty
is
that
the
elections
will
be
a
vote
for
or
against
Mr.
Gandhi
and
his
five
years
in
power
--
five
years
of
ups
and
downs
,
promises
and
disappointments
and
wide
fluctuations
in
popularity
.

Yesterday
,
four
days
after
an
unusual
parliamentary
defeat
for
the
ruling
party
,
Mr.
Gandhi
called
elections
for
the
lower
house
of
Parliament
on
Nov.
22
and
24
.

The
elections
will
be
held
in
different
states
on
one
of
the
two
days
.

(
The
lower
house
's
five-year
term
expires
in
January
;
the
Parliament
's
upper
house
is
appointed
.

)
The
elections
will
be
a
rigorous
test
for
the
45-year-old
prime
minister
and
Congress
(
I
)
,
which
in
various
forms
has
ruled
for
40
of
India
's
42
years
of
independence
.

After
a
landslide
win
in
1984
in
polls
held
after
the
assassination
of
his
mother
,
Indira
Gandhi
,
Mr.
Gandhi
saw
his
popularity
begin
a
roller
coaster
ride
.

His
early
promises
to
make
India
a
modern
nation
remain
bogged
down
in
bloated
bureaucracy
.

His
pledge
to
clean
up
local
administration
and
Indian
politics
,
including
his
own
party
,
went
unfulfilled
.

His
``
Mr.
Clean
''
image
was
muddied
by
an
arms-kickback
scandal
,
which
will
be
a
major
campaign
issue
.

Some
analysts
predict
that
disappointment
in
Mr.
Gandhi
's
spent
pledge
to
reduce
corruption
and
heavy-handed
local
government
will
crest
at
the
polls
.

``
There
's
a
wide
feeling
of
indignation
across
the
country
,
''
says
Bhabani
Sen
Gupta
of
the
Center
for
Policy
Research
,
in
New
Delhi
.

``
I
think
the
people
will
be
judging
the
regime
by
a
petty
policeman
,
by
a
corrupt
revenue
collector
.

This
could
be
a
big
protest
against
an
administrative
failure
.

''
Even
if
the
Congress
(
I
)
retains
control
of
the
government
,
Mr.
Gandhi
's
ability
to
push
through
major
initiatives
might
be
hobbled
by
a
thinner
majority
.

Economic
analysts
call
his
trail-blazing
liberalization
of
the
Indian
economy
incomplete
,
and
many
are
hoping
for
major
new
liberalizations
if
he
is
returned
firmly
to
power
.

The
Lok
Sabha
,
or
lower
house
of
Parliament
,
has
542
elected
and
two
appointed
seats
.

In
1984
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
captured
405
seats
,
the
largest
victory
in
the
history
of
Indian
democracy
.

The
landslide
was
fueled
by
panic
that
prevailed
in
India
at
the
time
.

Mrs.
Gandhi
had
been
assassinated
by
separatist
Sikhs
,
and
many
Indians
feared
their
country
might
split
apart
.

In
the
previous
three
general
elections
,
similar
national
issues
clinched
the
vote
.

In
1971
,
the
Congress
Party
won
after
India
's
victory
in
the
Bangladesh
war
.

In
1977
,
Mrs.
Gandhi
was
thrown
out
of
office
after
her
19-month
emergency
rule
,
and
in
1980
,
after
her
successors
made
a
mess
of
their
three
years
in
power
,
she
was
restored
to
office
.

Most
political
analysts
say
that
if
Mr.
Gandhi
's
opposition
unites
to
field
single
candidates
in
most
precincts
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
will
lose
big
.

But
if
the
opposition
remains
fractured
,
the
Congress
(
I
)
could
win
a
small
majority
,
or
lead
a
coalition
government
.

Chimanbhai
Mehta
,
a
parliamentarian
and
former
Gandhi
ally
,
predicts
Congress
(
I
)
will
win
only
150
seats
,
a
quarter
of
the
house
,
if
the
opposition
fields
single
candidates
in
80
%
of
the
races
.

Analysts
say
the
opposition
will
struggle
this
week
to
unite
,
and
its
success
will
be
clear
only
when
it
announces
its
final
list
of
parliamentary
candidates
.

The
arms-kickback
scandal
is
likely
to
be
one
of
the
big
talking
points
in
the
campaign
,
but
it
's
unclear
how
it
is
viewed
by
average
Indian
voters
.

In
1986
,
India
signed
a
$
1.4
billion
contract
with
AB
Bofors
,
a
unit
of
Nobel
Industries
Sweden
AB
,
to
purchase
400
artillery
pieces
.

The
contract
was
negotiated
by
the
countries
'
two
prime
ministers
,
and
was
supposed
to
be
free
of
commissions
or
agents
'
costs
.

In
April
1987
,
evidence
surfaced
that
commissions
were
paid
.

The
opposition
charged
that
the
money
was
used
to
bribe
Indian
government
officials
,
an
allegation
denied
by
Mr.
Gandhi
's
administration
.

But
many
of
his
statements
on
the
issue
in
Parliament
subsequently
were
proven
wrong
by
documentary
evidence
.

The
scandal
has
faded
and
flared
,
but
recent
disclosures
propelled
it
back
onto
the
front
pages
,
and
that
has
helped
galvanize
the
opposition
,
which
last
week
blocked
passage
of
two
constitutional
amendment
bills
.

It
was
the
first
time
in
20
years
that
such
government
bills
were
defeated
.

In
a
country
where
a
bribe
is
needed
to
get
a
phone
,
a
job
,
and
even
into
a
school
,
the
name
Bofors
has
become
a
potent
rallying
cry
against
the
government
.

That
illustrates
the
kind
of
disappointment
many
Indians
feel
toward
Mr.
Gandhi
,
whom
they
zestfully
elected
and
enthusiastically
supported
in
his
first
two
years
in
power
.

His
term
has
produced
no
spectacular
failures
in
politics
,
in
the
economy
or
on
the
military
front
,
and
has
chalked
up
some
successes
.

But
the
average
Indian
had
tremendous
hope
in
the
youthful
leader
and
his
promise
to
make
both
government
and
the
ruling
party
more
effective
and
less
corrupt
.

His
failures
in
those
two
areas
deeply
,
and
sometimes
bitterly
,
disappointed
many
Indians
.

``
We
do
n't
like
the
Congress
(
I
)
,
''
says
Sooraji
Jath
,
a
farmer
in
the
western
state
of
Gujarat
.

``
The
Congress
government
is
taking
the
farmers
'
bread
and
not
giving
us
any
support
.

When
there
are
well
problems
,
light
problems
,
road
problems
,
the
government
tells
us
to
forget
it
.

''
The
greatest
thing
going
for
Mr.
Gandhi
and
the
Congress
(
I
)
Party
is
the
poor
reputation
of
the
opposition
.

Even
if
it
unites
for
the
elections
,
its
coherence
is
likely
to
be
temporary
.

When
the
Congress
(
I
)
lost
the
1977
election
,
following
Mrs.
Gandhi
's
hated
emergency
rule
,
a
similar
coalition
took
power
and
then
disintegrated
.

Many
Indians
fear
a
repeat
of
that
experience
.

March
24
,
1986
:
AB
Bofors
,
a

contract
with

's
Defense
Ministry
to
supply
400
Bofors

field
howitzer
guns

In
1985
,
Prime
Minister
Rajiv
Gandhi
,
in
his
talks
with
then
Swedish
Prime
Minister
Olof
Palme
,
imposed
the
condition
that
the
contract
have
no
middlemen
.

April

1987
:
Swedish
National
Radio
reports
that
about
$
40
million
--
nearly
3
%
of
the
total
contract
--
was
paid
by
Bofors
as
commissions
to
middlemen
.

June

:
Sweden
's
National
Audit
Bureau
releases
its
report
confirming
payment
of
about
$
40
million
to
unidentified
Indians
.

The
report
says
that
investigations
were
severely
hampered
by
lack
of
cooperation
from
Bofors
.

Bofors
says
it
ca
n't
disclose
the
names
of
the
middlemen
because
it
would
jeopardize
industrial
confidentiality
.

A
portion
of
the
report
containing
names
of
the
middlemen
is
withheld
by
officials
citing
bank
secrecy
requirements
.

suggested
in
May
1987
that
the
government
cancel
the
Bofors
contract
.

According
to
Gen.
Sundarji
,
that
would
have
forced
Bofors
to
disclose
the
names
of
the
middlemen
who
received
kickbacks
from

company

His
recommendation
was
rejected
by

said
it

The
inverse
trading
relationship
between
bonds
and
stocks
was
interrupted
yesterday
as
bonds
fell
despite
a
modest
decline
in
stock
prices
.

But
bond
investors
continue
to
keep
a
close
watch
on
the
jittery
stock
market
.

In
early
trading
,
investors
were
bidding
bond
prices
higher
as
stocks
tumbled
and
fears
mounted
that
Friday
's
stock
market
debacle
would
be
repeated
.

But
a
partial
recovery
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
,
which
had
been
down
more
than
60
points
in
midmorning
,
dashed
those
expectations
.

Treasury
bonds
also
were
hurt
late
in
the
day
by
a
$
4
billion
offering
by
the
Tennessee
Valley
Authority
and
the
prospect
of
a
huge
amount
of
new
agency
debt
.

``
Bond
investors
were
hoping
that
stock
prices
would
continue
to
fall
,
''
said
Roger
Early
,
a
vice
president
at
Federated
Investors
Inc.
,
Pittsburgh
.

``
When
stocks
stabilized
,
that
was
a
disappointment
.

''
Meanwhile
,
for
the
second
straight
day
,
the
bond
market
paid
little
attention
to
the
Federal
Reserve
's
open
market
operations
.

Fed
officials
injected
more
cash
into
the
banking
system
by
arranging
$
1.5
billion
of
repurchase
agreements
during
the
usual
pre-noon
intervention
period
.

The
move
was
meant
to
keep
a
lid
on
interest
rates
and
to
boost
investor
confidence
.

``
The
intervention
has
been
friendly
,
meaning
that
they
really
did
n't
have
to
do
it
,
''
said
Maria
Fiorini
Ramirez
,
money-market
economist
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

She
said
a
more
aggressive
move
was
n't
needed
.

The
Fed
also
appears
reluctant
to
ease
credit
conditions
further
.

It
already
has
allowed
the
closely
watched
federal
funds
rate
to
decline
percentage
point
to
about
8
%
from
its
previous
target
level
of
about
9
%
.

The
rate
,
which
banks
charge
each
other
on
overnight
loans
,
is
considered
an
early
signal
of
changes
in
Fed
policy
.

It
ended
at
about
8
%
yesterday
,
but
was
as
low
as
8
%
Monday
.

The
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
bond
fell
more
than
point
,
or
over
$
5
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
while
the
yield
moved
above
8
%
for
the
first
time
since
Thursday
.

Investment-grade
corporate
,
municipal
and
mortgage-backed
securities
also
fell
.

But
most
junk
bonds
closed
unchanged
after
opening
slightly
higher
on
bargain-hunting
by
institutional
investors
.

Some
so-called
high-quality
junk
issues
,
such
as
R.H.
Macy
&
Co.
's
14
%
subordinated
debentures
,
rose
.

The
Macy
's
issue
closed
up
about
one
point
at
a
bid
price
of
97
.

The
TVA
's
public
debt
offering
was
its
first
in
15
years
.

Strong
investor
demand
prompted
it
to
boost
the
size
of
the
issue
from
$
3
billion
.

Traders
said
hedging
related
to
the
TVA
pricing
also
pressured
Treasury
bonds
.

``
Underwriters
of
the
TVA
bonds
reduced
their
market
risk
by
selling
Treasurys
to
cover
at
least
part
of
their
{
TVA
}
holdings
,
''
said
James
R.
Capra
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Shearson
Lehman
Government
Securities
Inc
.

The
TVA
bonds
also
``
served
to
remind
the
market
that
there
will
be
even
more
new
supply
,
''
said
Lawrence
N.
Leuzzi
,
a
managing
director
at
S.G.
Warburg
Securities
&
Co
.

Today
the
Treasury
will
announce
the
size
of
its
next
two-year
note
sale
and
Resolution
Funding
Corp.
will
announce
details
of
its
first
bond
offering
.

Some
traders
estimate
$
9.75
billion
of
new
two-year
Treasurys
will
be
sold
next
week
,
and
they
expect
Refcorp
to
offer
$
4
billion
to
$
6
billion
of
long-term
``
bailout
''
bonds
.

Refcorp
was
created
to
help
fund
the
thrift
bailout
.

Another
agency
issue
came
to
market
yesterday
.

The
Office
of
Finance
of
the
Federal
Home
Loan
Banks
said
it
priced
a
four-part
$
2.27
billion
bond
offering
for
the
banks
to
yield
from
8.125
%
to
8.375
%
.

The
release
of
several
economic
reports
had
little
impact
on
the
market
,
including
a
report
that
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
expanded
to
a
surprisingly
wide
$
10.77
billion
in
August
,
up
from
a
revised
$
8.24
billion
in
July
.

The
August
gap
was
expected
to
have
expanded
to
$
9.1
billion
.

Treasury
Securities
Treasury
securities
were
essentially
flat
to
about
point
lower
.

The
benchmark
30-year
bond
was
quoted
late
at
100
to
yield
8.04
%
,
compared
with
101
to
yield
7.97
%
Monday
.

The
latest
10-year

were
quoted
late
at
99
to
yield
8.01
%
,
compared
with
100
to
yield
7.97
%
.

Short-term
rates
increased
.

The
discount
rate
on
three-month
bills
rose
to
7.52
%
for
a
bond-equivalent
yield
of
7.75
%
.

The
rate
on
six-month

rose
to
7.53
%
for
a

of

%
.

Corporate
,
Other
Issues
Investment-grade
corporate
bonds
ended
to
point
lower
,
while
most
junk
bonds
ended
unchanged
.

The
TVA
's
huge
$
4
billion
offering
dominated
attention
in
the
new-issue
market
.

TVA
offered
$
2
billion
of
30-year
bonds
priced
to
yield
9.06
%
;
$
1
billion
in
10-year
notes
priced
to
yield
8.42
%
;
and
$
1
billion
in
five-year
notes
priced
to
yield
8.33
%
.

The
TVA
,
which
operates
one
of
the
nation
's
largest
electric
power
systems
,
is
a
corporation
wholly
owned
by
the
U.S.
government
.

Yesterday
's
bond
sale
was
part
of
a
$
6.7
billion
refinancing
plan
to
pay
off
high-interest
debt
the
TVA
owes
the
Federal
Financing
Bank
,
an
arm
of
the
Treasury
.

Meanwhile
,
Lockheed
Corp.
priced
a
$
300
million
note
offering
to
yield
9.39
%
.

Mortgage-Backed
Securities
The
derivative
mortgage-backed
market
revived
after
a
brief
hiatus
as
two
new
Remics
totaling
$
850
million
were
offered
and
talk
circulated
about
two
more
issues
that
could
be
priced
today
.

The
revival
of
the
real
estate
mortgage
investment
conduit
market
reflected
the
relative
calm
in
the
mortgage
market
after
two
days
of
volatile
trading
.

Dealers
noted
that
it
's
difficult
to
structure
new
Remics
when
prices
are
moving
widely
.

The
two
Remics
priced
were
a
$
500
million
Federal
Home
Loan
Mortgage
Corp.
issue
underwritten
by
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
a
$
350
million
Federal
National
Mortgage
Association
deal
underwritten
by
Greenwich
Capital
Markets
.

The
Remic
issuance
supported
prices
of
Freddie
Mac
and
Fannie
Mae
securities
,
which
held
up
better
than
Government
National
Mortgage
Association
securities
during
an
afternoon
sell-off
.

Ginnie
Mae
9
%
securities
for
November
delivery
ended
at
97
,
down
;
9
%
securities
at
99
,
down
;
and
10
%
securities
at
101
,
down
.

Freddie
Mac
9
%
securities
were
at
97
,
down
.

The
Ginnie
Mae
9
%
issue
was
yielding
9.43
%
to
a
12-year
average
life
assumption
,
as
the
spread
above
the
Treasury
10-year
note
held
at
1.42
percentage
points
.

Municipals
Confusion
over
the
near-term
trend
for
rates
dominated
the
municipal
arena
,
as
gyrations
in
the
stock
market
continued
to
buffet
bonds
.

Long
tax-exempt
dollar
bonds
were
mostly
flat
to
point
lower
after
a
whipsaw
session
of
moving
inversely
to
stocks
in
modest
dealer-led
trading
.

Prices
of
pre-refunded
municipal
bonds
were
capped
by
news
that
Chemical
Securities
Inc.
,
as
agent
for
a
customer
,
will
accept
bids
today
for
two
large
lists
of
bonds
that
include
many
such
issues
.

The
lists
total
$
654.5
million
.

Pre-refunded
bonds
are
called
at
their
earliest
call
date
with
the
escrowed
proceeds
of
another
bond
issue
.

Meanwhile
,
several
new
issues
were
priced
.

Underwriters
led
by
PaineWebber
Inc.
set
preliminary
pricing
for
$
144.4
million
of
California
Health
Facilities
Financing
Authority
revenue
bonds
for
Kaiser
Permanente
.

Tentative
reoffering
yields
were
set
from
6.25
%
in
1993
to
7.227
%
in
2018
.

As
part
of
its
College
Savings
Plan
,
Connecticut
offered
$
100.4
million
of
general
obligation
capital
appreciation
bonds
priced
to
yield
to
maturity
from
6.25
%
in
1994
to
6.90
%
in
2006
,
2007
and
2009
.

A
Chemical
Securities
group
won
a
$
100
million
Oregon
general

veterans
'
tax

issue
due
Nov.

,
1990
.

The
6
%
notes
yield
6.25
%
.

Foreign
Bonds
West
German
government
bond
prices
took
a
wild
roller-coaster
ride
,
pulled
down
by
Monday
's
U.S.
stock
market
gains
then
up
by
a
wider-than-expected
U.S.
trade
deficit
and
falling
U.S.
stock
prices
.

West
Germany
's
7
%
bond
due
October
1999
was
at
99.95
late
yesterday
,
off
0.10
point
from
Monday
,
to
yield
7.01
%
.

The
6
%
notes
due
April
1994
were
up
0.10
point
to
97.85
to
yield
7.31
%
.

British
government
bonds
surged
on
renewed
volatility
in
the
stock
market
.

The
Treasury
11
%
bond
due
rose
to
112
to
yield
10.03
%
.

But
Japanese
bonds
ended
weaker
.

The
benchmark
No.
111
4.6
%
bond
due
1998
ended
on
brokers
'
screens
at
a
price
of
96
,
off
0.15
point
to
yield
5.27
%
.

A
House-Senate
conference
approved
an
estimated
$
67
billion
fiscal
1990
spending
bill
that
provides
a
28
%
increase
for
space
research
and
development
and
incorporates
far-reaching
provisions
affecting
the
federal
mortgage
market
.

The
current
ceiling
on
home
loans
insured
by
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
would
be
increased
to
$
124,875
.

Separately
,
the
bill
gives
authority
to
the
Bush
administration
to
facilitate
the
refinancing
of
federally
subsidized
loans
for
low-income
and
moderate-income
homeowners
.

The
second
provision
,
affecting
so-called
235
mortgages
,
has
met
strong
opposition
from
investment
bankers
represented
by
the
Public
Securities
Association
.

And
a
squad
of
influential
former
Senate
aides
employed
by
the
Wall
Street
firm
Salomon
Brothers
came
to
the
Capitol
in
a
vain
attempt
to
strip
the
provision
.

By
an
11-2
margin
,
Senate
negotiators
voted
to
preserve
the
235
mortgage
refinancing
plan
,
and
despite
powerful
allies
,
the
opposition
found
itself
undercut
by
an
unusual
alliance
of
liberals
and
conservatives
.

The
government
currently
is
subsidizing
an
estimated
23,000
loans
above
11
%
under
the
235
program
,
and
however
disruptive
to
private
investors
,
the
refinancing
is
expected
to
yield
at
least
$
15
million
in
savings
in
fiscal
1990
.

This
sum
has
been
guarded
jealously
by
appropriators
anxious
to
offset
spending
elsewhere
,
and
conservative
Sen.
Phil
Gramm
cast
the
fight
as
a
populist
stand
against
monied
interests
.

``
We
are
stewards
here
,
not
of
the
mortgage
companies
,
but
the
taxpayers
,
''
said
the
Texas
Republican
.

The
action
came
as
the
administration
won
final
congressional
approval
of
$
9
million
in
assistance
for
elections
scheduled
in
Nicaragua
in
February
.

The
bulk
of
the
money
would
be
funneled
through
the
National
Endowment
for
Democracy
,
but
the
legislation
is
so
vaguely
written
that
it
has
been
dogged
by
questions
regarding
the
money
's
true
purpose
and
its
ultimate
destination
.

The
Senate
had
refused
late
Friday
to
invoke
cloture
and
limit
debate
,
but
behind
the
bipartisan
leadership
,
a
solid
majority
took
shape
yesterday
and
brushed
aside
amendments
seeking
to
cut
the
total
package
or
steer
it
away
from
direct
aid
to
political
parties
.

Final
approval
--
on
a
64-35
roll
call
--
was
never
in
doubt
,
but
the
opposition
drew
an
unusual
mix
of
senators
,
including
Republicans
Jesse
Helms
and
Warren
Rudman
and
Democrats
Bill
Bradley
and
John
Glenn
.

The
money
will
be
applied
for
voter
registration
and
election
monitoring
,
but
more
than
half
is
likely
to
go
to
the
Union
Nacional
Opositora
party
.

Critics
warned
such
cash
contributions
may
only
undercut
the
opposition
party
's
standing
,
and
one
irony
is
that
under
Nicaraguan
law
a
major
portion
of
the
opposition
party
's
funds
must
be
shared
with
the
government
's
Supreme
Electoral
Council
.

Within
the
appropriations
conference
yesterday
,
the
$
67
billion
measure
is
the
second
largest
of
the
annual
domestic
spending
bills
and
covers
a
disparate
collection
of
accounts
for
science
,
housing
,
veterans
and
the
environment
.

The
decision
to
raise
the
ceiling
on
FHA
home
loans
still
faces
strong
opposition
in
the
House
.

But
it
is
driven
by
the
same
fiscal
pressures
that
have
forced
lawmakers
to
resort
to
various
bookkeeping
devices
to
juggle
as
much
as
$
1
billion
in
spending
that
would
otherwise
put
the
bill
over
budget
.

These
costs
will
complicate
the
budget
picture
in
fiscal
1991
,
and
the
measure
further
commits
Congress
to
a
set
of
costly
projects
,
including
the
first
construction
funds
for
the
space
station
.

The
station
is
promised
$
1.8
billion
within
the
$
5.36
billion
provided
for
research
and
development
in
the
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
,
and
the
nation
's
high-speed
aerospace
plane
--
cut
by
the
Senate
--
could
receive
as
much
as
$
60
million
in
new
funds
or
transfers
.

Similarly
,
the
House
agreed
to
add
back
$
62
million
to
continue
work
on
the
advanced
communications
technology
satellite
,
being
developed
by
General
Electric
Co
.

And
while
setting
a
statutory
limit
of
$
1.6
billion
on
the
automated
space
probe
,
the
conference
appropriated
$
30
million
for
the
start-up
of
the
CRAF-Cassini
mission
,
a
successor
to
the
Voyager
space
probe
.

Among
major
domestic
agencies
,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
stands
to
receive
increases
significantly
beyond
those
sought
by
the
administration
,
with
pollution
abatement
and
control
accounts
growing
by
14
%
to
about
$
829.9
million
.

An
estimated
$
1.57
billion
is
separately
allocated
for
the
National
Science
Foundation
,
and
within
the
Housing
and
Urban
Development
Department
,
more
than
$
9.2
billion
is
provided
for
federally
assisted
housing
,
including
an
expanded
effort
to
modernize
public
housing
units
that
serve
the
poorest
families
.

To
an
unusual
degree
,
the
massive
bill
has
become
a
vehicle
for
lawmakers
to
earmark
funds
for
projects
in
home
states
.

While
the
practice
was
discouraged
in
the
past
,
the
conference
agreement
is
laced
with
veterans
'
hospitals
,
environmental
projects
and
urban
grants
designated
for
specific
communities
.

The
most
striking
example
yesterday
may
have
been
in
community
development
funds
,
where
the
two
houses
had
separately
approved
a
total
of
27
projects
valued
at
$
20
million
,
and
the
conference
added
15
more
valued
at
$
8
million
to
ostensibly
preserve
``
balance
''
between
the
House
and
Senate
.

Yesterday
's
conference
agreement
is
the
second
major
bill
to
emerge
from
negotiations
this
week
,
as
appropriators
approved
a
fiscal
1990
transportation
bill
late
Monday
that
includes
a
sweeping
ban
on
smoking
on
most
domestic
airline
flights
.

An
exemption
will
remain
for
flights
longer
than
six
hours
to
Hawaii
and
Alaska
,
but
estimates
by
the
tobacco
industry
yesterday
indicate
all
but
about
30
flights
would
be
covered
.

Separately
,
a
third
conference
report
covering
an
$
18.4
billion
Treasury
and
Postal
Service
bill
was
sent
to
the
Senate
after
passing
the
House
on
a
383-30
roll
call
yesterday
.

And
after
weeks
of
delay
,
the
appropriations
process
is
beginning
to
take
some
final
shape
.

Defense
and
foreign
aid
are
the
two
most
critical
areas
remaining
from
the
administration
's
standpoint
.

And
among
domestic
programs
,
the
most
serious
threat
is
White
House
opposition
to
abortion
riders
attached
to
separate
bills
funding
the
District
of
Columbia
and
Department
of
Health
and
Human
Services
.

The
same
issue
threatens
to
spill
over
to
the
foreign
aid
debate
,
and
Mr.
Bush
also
is
threatening
to
veto
any
agreement
that
preserves
Senate-passed
provisions
renewing
U.S.
support
for
the
United
Nations
Fund
for
Population
Activities
.

In
a
sharply
written
letter
,
Rep.
David
Obey
,
chairman
of
the
House
appropriations
subcommittee
for
foreign
operations
,
warned
Mr.
Bush
that
the
result
of
his
``
ultimatum
''
could
weaken
efforts
to
accommodate
the
administration
elsewhere
.

``
As
a
result
of
your
ultimatum
,
''

I

there

Markets
usually
get
noticed
because
they
soar
or
plunge
.

Gold
,
which
has
n't
risen
or
fallen
significantly
in
quite
some
time
,
yesterday
achieved
what
may
be
a
new
level
of
impassiveness
:
The
most
actively
traded
futures
contracts
closed
unchanged
despite
nervous
fluctuations
in
both
the
dollar
and
the
stock
market
.

The
settlement
prices
of
the
December
,
February
and
April
gold
contracts
were
even
with
Monday
's
final
prices
.

The
December
1989
contract
,
which
has
the
greatest
trading
volume
,
ended
at
$
371.20
an
ounce
.

The
other
months
posted
advances
of
10
cents
to
20
cents
an
ounce
.

According
to
one
analyst
,
Bernard
Savaiko
of
PaineWebber
,
New
York
,
the
stock
market
's
ability
on
Monday
to
rally
from
last
Friday
's
decline
--
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
economy
was
n't
going
to
fall
either
--
took
the
starch
out
of
precious
metals
prices
,
and
out
of
gold
's
,
in
particular
.

Yesterday
,
gold
traded
within
a
narrow
range
.

Gold
tried
to
rally
on
Monday
but
ran
into
the
same
situation
that
has
subdued
gold
prices
for
more
than
a
year
:
selling
by
gold
producers
,
who
want
to
fix
the
highest
possible
price
for
their
gold
.

``
December
delivery
gold
is
trading
in
a
range
of
$
365
to
$
375
{
an
ounce
}
and
is
having
difficulty
breaking
out
above
that
,
''
Mr.
Savaiko
said
.

``
Producers
at
the
moment
regard
that
area
a
good
one
in
which
to
sell
gold
.

''
Also
,
Mr.
Savaiko
noted
,
stock
market
investors
seeking
greater
safety
are
veering
toward
buying
bonds
rather
than
precious
metals
because
``
we
are
tending
more
toward
a
disinflationary
economy
that
does
n't
make
gold
and
precious
metals
attractive
.

''
Jeffrey
Nichols
,
president
of
APMS
Canada
,
Toronto
precious
metals
advisers
,
said
there
is
little
to
motivate
gold
traders
to
buy
the
metal
.

``
Investors
in
the
U.S.
and
Europe
are
comfortable
with
the
actions
of
the
{
Federal
Reserve
}
in
its
willingness
to
supply
liquidity
to
financial
system
,
which
helped
the
stock
market
rebound
on
Monday
,
''
he
said
.

There
is
n't
any
rush
on
the
part
of
investors
in
the
West
to
buy
gold
,
he
said
.

``
They
still
bear
the
memory
of
October
1987
,
when
they
bought
gold
after
the
stock
market
crashed
and
ended
up
losing
money
because
gold
prices
subsequently
fell
,
''
Mr.
Nichols
said
.

``
It
's
an
experience
they
do
n't
want
to
repeat
.

''
At
the
moment
gold
traders
are
n't
concerned
about
inflation
,
he
said
,
and
as
for
the
dollar
,
``
gold
's
association
with
the
currency
has
been
diminishing
recently
so
drops
in
the
currency
are
n't
having
much
impact
on
gold
.

''
Dinsa
Mehta
,
chief
bullion
trader
for
Chase
Manhattan
Bank
,
said
:
``
There
is
little
incentive
on
the
part
of
traders
to
sell
gold
because
the
stock
market
may
go
lower
and
gold
may
retain
some
of
its
`
flight
to
safety
'
quality
.

There
is
little
incentive
to
buy
gold
because
if
the
stock
market
goes
higher
,
it
may
be
just
a
false
alarm
.

This
is
keeping
the
gold
traders
handcuffed
.

''
The
most
remarkable
feature
about
yesterday
's
action
was
that
the
price
of
roughly
$
370
an
ounce
was
regarded
as
attractive
enough
by
gold
producers
around
the
world
to
aggressively
sell
gold
,
Mr.
Mehta
said
.

``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
means
over
the
long
run
,
but
for
the
short
term
,
it
appears
that
gold
producers
are
grateful
for
the
$
10
or
so
that
gold
has
risen
over
the
past
week
or
so
,
''
he
said
.

Previously
,
he
noted
,
gold
producers
tended
to
back
off
from
a
rising
gold
market
,
letting
prices
rise
as
much
as
possible
before
selling
.

Mr.
Mehta
observed
that
the
U.S.
merchandise
trade
deficit
,
which
rose
sharply
in
August
,
according
to
yesterday
's
report
,
has
been
having
less
and
less
impact
on
the
gold
market
.

``
The
dollar
has
n't
reacted
much
to
it
,
so
gold
has
n't
either
,
''
he
said
.

In
other
commodity
markets
yesterday
:
ENERGY
:
Crude
oil
prices
rose
slightly
in
lackluster
activity
as
traders
in
the
pits
tried
to
assess
action
in
the
stock
market
.

Since
stock
market
indexes
plummeted
last
Friday
,
participants
in
all
markets
have
been
wary
.

When
traders
become
confident
that
the
stock
market
has
stabilized
,
oil
prices
are
expected
to
rise
as
supply
and
demand
fundamentals
once
again
become
the
major
consideration
.

Crude
oil
for
November
delivery
edged
up
by
16
cents
a
barrel
to
$
20.75
a
barrel
.

Heating
oil
prices
also
rose
.

November
gasoline
slipped
slightly
.

SUGAR
:
Futures
prices
rose
on
a
report
that
Cuba
may
seek
to
postpone
some
sugar
shipments
.

The
March
contract
advanced
0.14
cent
a
pound
to
14.11
cents
.

According
to
an
analyst
,
Cuba
ca
n't
meet
all
its
shipment
commitments
and
has
asked
Japan
to
accept
a
delay
of
shipments
scheduled
for
later
this
year
,
into
early
next
year
.

``
Japan
is
perceived
as
a
wealthy
nation
that
can
turn
elsewhere
in
the
world
market
and
buy
the
sugar
,
''
the
analyst
said
.

It
was
the
possibility
of
this
demand
that
helped
firm
prices
,
the
analyst
said
.

Another
analyst
noted
that
Cuba
has
been
deferring
shipments
in
recent
years
.

``
To
the
professionals
in
the
trade
it
did
n't
cause
much
surprise
.

The
March
futures
contract
traded
as
high
as
14.24
cents
,
but
could
n't
sustain
the
advance
,
''
he
said
.

LIVESTOCK
AND
MEATS
:
The
prices
of
cattle
,
hogs
and
pork
belly
futures
contracts
rebounded
as
livestock
traders
shook
off
fears
that
the
Friday
stock
market
plunge
would
chill
consumer
spending
,
which
in
turn
would
hurt
retail
sales
of
beef
and
pork
.

The
prices
of
most
livestock
futures
contracts
had
dropped
sharply
Monday
.

Cattle
futures
prices
were
also
supported
yesterday
by
signs
that
supermarket
chains
are
making
plans
to
increase
their
promotions
concerning
beef
.

GRAINS
AND
SOYBEANS
:
The
prices
of
most
soybean
and
soybean-meal
futures
contracts
rose
amid
rumors
that
the
Soviet
Union
is
interested
in
buying
from
the
U.S.
or
South
America
about
250,000
metric
tons
of
soybeans
and
as
many
as
400,000
metric
tons
of
soybean
meal
.

Traders
are
especially
sensitive
to
reports
of
possible
U.S.
soybean
sales
because
U.S.
exports
are
lagging
.

Since
Sept.
1
,
about
13
million
fewer
bushels
of
U.S.
soybeans
have
been
sold
overseas
than
for
the
same
period
last
year
.

Corn
futures
prices
rose
slightly
while
wheat
prices
settled
mixed
.

Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
,
fretting
about
increasing
competitive
pressure
on
Ryder
,
placed
about
$
2.8
billion
in
company
securities
under
review
for
possible
downgrade
.

Ratings
under
review
are
Ryder
's
A-1
collateral
trust
debentures
,
A-2
senior
notes
and
bonds
,
A-2
preferred
stock
and
the
company
's
Prime-1
rating
for
commercial
paper
.

Moody
's
said
it
is
assessing
the
strategies
Ryder
's
management
may
follow
in
addressing
significant
challenges
in
some
major
markets
.

The
rating
agency
said
it
is
focusing
especially
on
the
transportation
service
company
's
efforts
to
control
costs
,
improve
margins
and
enhance
its
competitive
position
in
its
primary
business
,
vehicle
leasing
and
rental
.

The
nations
of
southern
Africa
know
a
lot
about
managing
elephants
;
their
herds
are
thriving
.

But
the
nations
of
Europe
and
North
America
have
decided
they
know
better
.

At
this
week
's
U.N.
conference
in
Lausanne
,
they
imposed
a
global
ivory
ban
that
seeks
to
overturn
local
policies
.

A
Zimbabwean
delegate
argued
that
the
ban
would
``
guarantee
the
extinction
of
the
elephant
.

''
Legitimate
ranchers
,
who
have
an
interest
in
preserving
the
herds
,
would
go
out
of
business
.

Poachers
would
control
the
underground
trade
.

Many
delegates
were
willing
to
craft
a
compromise
,
but
U.S.
delegate
Constance
Harriman
and
others
thundered
that
down
.

The
Greens
from
the
First
World
wanted
a
morality
play
,
not
a
negotiation
.

Fortunately
,
the
nations
of
southern
Africa
have
n't
totally
surrendered
their
sovereignty
.

Five
countries
announced
they
would
not
honor
what
one
Zimbabwean
delegate
wryly
called
the
``
made
in
Switzerland
''
solution
.

In
fact
,
they
seemed
a
mite
resentful
.

The
director
of
Zimbabwe
's
Wildlife
Department
described
American
conservationists
as
``
fat
little
puppies
from
urban
environments
who
do
n't
know
a
thing
about
Africa
.

''
That
's
not
fair
;
they
're
not
all
fat
.

HUGO'S
BLAST
generates
pleas
for
aid
from
South
Carolina
small
businesses
.

The
Small
Business
Administration
has
received
more
than
5,000
formal
requests
for
disaster
loans
because
of
the
hurricane
.

About
45
%
of
requests
for
SBA
relief
loans
,
which
also
are
available
to
homeowners
,
come
from
small
businesses
,
compared
with
a
25
%
business
share
after
most
disasters
.

The
SBA
expects
to
make
about
$
1
billion
in
Hurricane
Hugo
loans
.

The
disaster
fund
is
replenished
by
loan
repayments
.

Hardest
hit
by
Hugo
in
South
Carolina
were
small
retailers
tied
to
the
tourist
industry
and
businesses
in
agriculture
and
cultivated
seafood
.

The
State
Development
Board
set
up
a
Hugo
Hotline
to
accept
business-to-business
help
.

After
NBC
weather
man
Willard
Scott
broadcast
the
hot-line
number
,
it
was
flooded
with
10,000
calls
.

Last
week
,
the
U.S.
Chamber
of
Commerce
began
using
its
national
TV
show
to
seek
help
,
such
as
equipment
,
for
business
owners
.

Local
bankers
and
accountants
help
applicants
fill
out
forms
.

``
It
helps
us
,
and
people
feel
better
talking
to
someone
who
's
gone
through
the
same
thing
,
''
an
SBA
official
says
.

HEALTH
BENEFITS
remain
a
central
lobbying
effort
,
even
as
Section
89
fades
.

The
Senate
,
after
deleting
Section
89
repeal
from
its
deficit-reduction
bill
,
still
is
expected
to
join
the
House
in
voting
to
kill
the
law
,
which
forces
companies
to
provide
comparable
benefits
to
laborers
and
executives
alike
.

In
lobbying
on
other
health-coverage
topics
,
the
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
will
press
for
legislation
that
would
give
self-employed
people
a
100
%
tax
deduction
for
their
own
health
plans
,
up
from
25
%
currently
.

And
the
group
will
urge
that
the
federal
government
pre-empt
state
rules
on
what
must
be
covered
by
employers
'
health
insurance
.

Small-business
groups
also
will
fight
the
medical-leave
provision
of
legislation
that
would
expand
parental
leaves
.

And
they
still
oppose
as
too
costly
an
employer-paid
health
insurance
bill
sponsored
by
Sen.
Edward
Kennedy
(
D.
,
Mass
.

)
despite
his
proposal
to
phase
in
small
business
only
gradually
.

There
is
also
worry
that
the
Pepper
Commission
studying
long-term
health
care
will
again
push
lawmakers
toward
employerpaid
solutions
.

The
Section
89
victory
could
have
a
downside
by
making
it
harder
to
oppose
lawmakers
on
other
health
proposals
.

``
With
the
repeal
of
Section
89
,
we
can
no
longer
say
they
're
discouraging
businesses
from
offering
health
plans
,
''
says
Christine
Russell
,
the
Chamber
of
Commerce
's
small-business
advocate
.

JUMPING
THE
GUN
:
Sen.
Lloyd
Bentsen
(
D.
,
Texas
)
was
outraged
after
a
private
word
to
John
Motley
,
lobbyist
for
the
National
Federation
of
Independent
Business
,
resulted
in
a
news
release
saying
that
the
Senate
Finance
Committee
chairman
would
recommend
repeal
of
Section
89
.

Even
though
the
announcement
was
true
in
the
end
,
it
was
issued
without
the
senator
's
permission
.

``
I
blew
it
,
''
Mr.
Motley
says
apologetically
.

``
It
was
a
timing
mistake
.

''
PRISON-SHOP
BLUES
:
Sen.
Strom
Thurmond
(
R.
,
S.C
.

)
protests
pending
legislation
to
end
the
preference
that
the
federal
prison
system
gets
in
selling
prisoner-made
furniture
and
other
goods
to
government
agencies
.

Small-business
suppliers
want
prisons
to
stop
getting
high
priority
,
especially
as
prison
production
grows
with
swelling
inmate
populations
.

Last
year
,
the
prisons
'
sales
to
the
Pentagon
totaled
$
336
million
.

REPAIR
SHOPS
SCRAP
for
more
access
to
work
on
auto-emissions
systems
.

Groups
representing
some
independent
auto-repair
shops
join
a
compromise
on
the
Clean
Air
legislation
worked
out
between
environmentalists
and
Rep.
Henry
Waxman
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
.

The
plan
would
increase
the
warranty
on
auto-emission
systems
to
eight
years
or
80,000
miles
from
five
years
or
50,000
for
major
parts
.

But
the
warranty
on
simpler
parts
would
be
lowered
to
two
years
or
24,000
miles
.

The
garage
owners
say
they
would
benefit
because
car
owners
would
be
less
likely
to
go
back
to
dealers
for
the
simpler
repairs
after
two
years
.

The
repair
shops
are
n't
united
,
however
.

Shops
represented
by
the
Automotive
Service
Industry
Association
and
the
Motor
Equipment
Manufacturers
Association
oppose
any
increase
in
warranty
length
.

They
say
the
longer
the
warranty
,
the
longer
customers
will
automatically
return
to
new-car
dealers
,
which
then
find
non-warranty
work
that
might
otherwise
go
to
repair
shops
.

The
House
Energy
Committee
will
debate
the
issue
later
this
month
.

Stan
Hathcock
,
an
Atlanta
garage
owner
who
opposes
a
longer
warranty
,
estimates
that
the
current
plan
costs
him
as
much
as
$
15,000
a
year
in
lost
business
.

Moody
's
Investors
Service
Inc.
said
it
lowered
ratings
on
about
$
650
million
of
Beatrice
Co.
debt
,
citing
the
closely
held
Chicago
food
concern
's
proposed
recapitalization
.

The
ratings
concern
said
it
downgraded
Beatrice
notes
,
Euronotes
and
certain
industrial
revenue
bonds
to
single-B-1
from
Ba-3
and
the
company
's
subordinated
debentures
to
single-B-3
from
single-B-2
.

Moody
's
said
the
proposed
recaptilization
may
``
limit
the
company
's
ability
to
realize
its
profit
potential
''
and
that
paying
dividends
from
a
new
series
of

squeeze
``
basic

operations

''
A
Beatrice
spokesman
did
n't
return
calls
seeking
comment
.

Beatrice
,
which
went
private
in
an
$
8.2
billion
leveraged
buy-out
in
1986
,
said
last
month
that
it
might
borrow
again
to
help
pay
investors
as
much
as
$
983
million
in
preferred
stock
and
debt
securities
.

When
the
Soviets
announced
their
last
soldier
had
left
Afghanistan
in
February
,
the
voices
of
skepticism
were
all
but
drowned
out
by
an
international
chorus
of
euphoria
.

It
was
``
the
Soviets
'
Vietnam
.

''
The
Kabul
regime
would
fall
.

Millions
of
refugees
would
rush
home
.

A
resistance
government
would
walk
into
Kabul
.

Those
who
bought
that
illusion
are
now
bewildered
.

Eight
months
after
Gen.
Boris
Gromov
walked
across
the
bridge
into
the
U.S.S.R.
,
a
Soviet-controlled
regime
remains
in
Kabul
,
the
refugees
sit
in
their
camps
,
and
the
restoration
of
Afghan
freedom
seems
as
far
off
as
ever
.

But
there
never
was
a
chance
that
the
Afghan
resistance
would
overthrow
the
Kabul
regime
quickly
and
easily
.

Soviet
leaders
said
they
would
support
their
Kabul
clients
by
all
means
necessary
--
and
did
.

The
U.S.
said
it
would
fully
support
the
resistance
--
and
did
n't
.

With
the
February
1987
U.N.
accords
``
relating
to
Afghanistan
,
''
the
Soviet
Union
got
everything
it
needed
to
consolidate
permanent
control
.

The
terms
of
the
Geneva
accords
leave
Moscow
free
to
provide
its
clients
in
Kabul
with
assistance
of
any
kind
--
including
the
return
of
Soviet
ground
forces
--
while
requiring
the
U.S.
and
Pakistan
to
cut
off
aid
.

The
only
fly
in
the
Soviet
ointment
was
the
last-minute
addition
of
a
unilateral
American
caveat
,
that
U.S.
aid
to
the
resistance
would
continue
as
long
as
Soviet
aid
to
Kabul
did
.

But
as
soon
as
the
accords
were
signed
,
American
officials
sharply
reduced
aid
.

In
February
1989
,
when
the
Soviets
said
they
had
completed
their
pullout
,
the
U.S.
cut
it
further
.

Not
so
the
Soviets
.

Gen.
Gromov
himself
said
Soviet
troops
expected
to
leave
behind
more
than
$
1
billion
of
military
equipment
and
installations
for
the
Kabul
regime
.

Since
the
troop
withdrawal
,
Moscow
has
poured
in
an
additional
$
200
to
$
300
million
worth
per
month
--
nearly
$
2
billion
since
February
,
equivalent
to
the
total
U.S.
aid
to
the
resistance
in
nine
years
.

This
includes
what
Deputy
Foreign
Minister
Yuli
Vorontsov
fetchingly
called
``
new
peaceful
long-range
weapons
,
''
including
more
than
800
SCUD
missiles
.

By
early
May
,
Moscow
had
delivered
,
for
example
,
1,000
trucks
,
about
100
tanks
,
artillery
and
hundreds
of
other
combat
vehicles
.

Later
that
month
,
it
added
an
entire
tank
brigade
,
including
120
T-72
tanks
and
more
than
40
BMP
state-of-the-art
infantry
fighting
vehicles
.

By
September
,
a
new
Reinforced
Motorized
Rifle
Brigade
with
an
additional
300
combat
vehicles
,
1,000
more
trucks
and
10,000
Soviet-trained
Afghan
troops
had
arrived
in
Kandahar
.

In
the
last
few
weeks
,
Moscow
has
added
FROG-7B
missiles
,
the
bomber
version
of
the
An-12
,
MiG-23BN
high-altitude
aircraft
,
MiG-29s
,
which
can
outfly
Pakistan
's
U.S.-built
F16s
,
and
Sukhoi
SU-27
fighter-bombers
,
which
can
outfly
the
MiG-29s
.

Moscow
claims
this
is
all
needed
to
protect
the
Kabul
regime
against
the
guerrilla
resistance
.

It
is
well-known
that
the
regular
Afghan
infantry
is
filled
with
reluctant
conscripts
.

But
this
is
not
the
entire
Afghan
army
,
and
it
is
no
longer
Kabul
's
only
military
force
.

Complete
units
have
been
trained
and
indoctrinated
in
the
U.S.S.R.
and
other
East
bloc
nations
;
30,000
to
40,000
of
these
troops
have
returned
.

In
addition
,
the
regime
has
established
well-paid
paramilitary
forces
totaling
more
than
100,000
,
including
35,000
Soviet-trained
troops
of
the
Interior
Ministry
(
)
,
which
still
is
directed
by
1,500
Soviet
KGB
officers
.

Even
if
not
all
these
forces
are
committed
to
the
regime
,
they
are
now
dependent
on
it
.

And
thousands
of
Afghan
children
have
been
taken
to
the
Soviet
Union
,
where
they
are
hostage
for
the
behavior
of
their
families
.

Since
1981
,
Indian
military
advisers
have
been
assisting
the
Kabul
regime
.

In
preparation
for
the
withdrawal
,
Moscow
,
Kabul
and
New
Delhi
signed
two
agreements
for
several
hundred
newly
civilian
Indian
experts
to
replace
some
of
the
more
visible
Soviet
military
personnel
.

Cuban
military
personnel
also
have
been
active
in
Afghanistan
since
1979
.

The
Soviets
cut
a
deal
with
Iran
:
a
future
Iranian
role
in
Afghanistan
in
exchange
for
Iranian
support
of
Soviet
policy
.

The
deal
was
symbolized
by
the
restoration
of
the
Shi'ite
Sultan
Ali
Keshtmand
to
the
Afghan
prime
ministry
.

Moreover
,
serious
questions
have
been
raised
about
the
claimed
withdrawal
of
Soviet
forces
.

Before
his
assassination
in
1988
,
President
Zia
of
Pakistan
repeatedly
stated
that
fresh
Soviet
troops
were
being
inserted
into
Afghanistan
even
as
others
were
ostentatiously
withdrawn
.

Rep.
Bill
McCollum
(
R.
,
Fla.
)
reports
that
these
included
20,000
to
30,000
Soviet
Central
Asian
KGB
Border
Guards
,
ethnically
indistinguishable
from
Afghans
and
wearing
unmarked
uniforms
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Kabul
regime
is
increasingly
successful
at
portraying
the
resistance
as
bloody-minded
fanatics
.

In
this
they
are
aided
by
years
of
American
,
European
,
Pakistani
and
Saudi
support
for
the
most
extreme
factions
--
radical
Islamic
fanatics
with
leaders
whose
policies
are
anathema
to
the
Afghan
public
.

This
heavy
outside
support
for
the
worst
has
undermined
better
,
moderate
leaders
.

In
autumn
last
year
,
for
example
,
the
regime
garrison
at
Kandahar
was
prepared
to
surrender
the
city
to
resistance
moderates
.

At
the
last
minute
,
however
,
Pakistani
officials
sent
in
Gulbuddin
Hekhmatyar
,
perhaps
the
most
hated
and
feared
of
the
extremists
,
with
a
demand
that
the
surrender
be
made
to
his
forces
.

The
deal
fell
through
,
and
Kandahar
remains
a
major
regime
base
.

The
resistance
lacks
not
only
air
power
,
armor
and
expertise
but
often
such
essentials
as
maps
,
mine
detectors
,
or
even
winter
gloves
.

Experienced
resistance
commanders
wanted
to
use
guerrilla
action
and
siege
tactics
to
wear
down
the
regime
.

Instead
,
they
were
pressured
by
Pakistan
's
ISI
,
the
channel
for
their
support
,
into
attacking
Jalalabad
.

They
took
more
than
25
%
casualties
;
journalists
report
that
they
faced
minefields
without
mine
detectors
.

The
wonder
is
not
that
the
resistance
has
failed
to
topple
the
Kabul
regime
,
but
that
it
continues
to
exist
and
fight
at
all
.

Last
summer
,
in
response
to
congressional
criticism
,
the
State
Department
and
the
CIA
said
they
had
resumed
military
aid
to
the
resistance
months
after
it
was
cut
off
;
but
it
is
not
clear
how
much
is
being
sent
or
when
it
will
arrive
.

For
months
the
resistance
has
been
defenseless
against
air
attack
.

Thus
far
there
is
no
indication
that
they
have
been
re-supplied
with
Stingers
or
other
anti-aircraft
weapons
.

Indeed
,
U.S.
officials
have
indicated
to
the
press
that
the
continuation
of
aid
depends
on
what
success
the
weakened
resistance
achieves
by
the
end
of
this
year
.

Moscow
and
Kabul
must
have
found
that
information
useful
.

For
a
decade
U.S.
policy
has
been
incoherent
,
based
on
miscalculation
and
the
defense
of
bureaucratic
and
political
turf
.

No
settlement
negotiated
by
others
can
force
the
Afghan
people
to
give
up
their
struggle
.

A
cutoff
of
U.S.
military
aid
would
merely
abandon
them
to
die
in
vain
.

Creation
of
a
new
,
realistic
U.S.
policy
is
long
overdue
.

Nothing
stirred
the
soul
of
Ronald
Reagan
and
his
disciples
as
much
as
the
crusade
to
aid
Nicaragua
's
Contra
rebels
,
or
the
dream
of
building
a
space-based
defense
shield
to
knock
out
Soviet
nuclear
missiles
.

Yet
under
Mr.
Reagan
's
preferred
successor
,
President
Bush
,
those
two
cherished
national-security
causes
are
withering
on
the
vine
.

And
,
surprisingly
,
little
more
than
a
whimper
of
protest
is
being
heard
,
even
though
Reaganauts
once
breathed
fire
supporting
the
Contras
and
the
Strategic
Defense
Initiative
.

``
The
programs
have
arthritis
,
''
says
Rep.
Henry
Hyde
,
a
conservative
Republican
from
Illinois
.

Yet
,
he
asserts
,
``
you
look
around
...
and
you
say
,
`
Who
are
the
leaders
?
Who
is
going
to
carry
the
water
?
'
''
It
is
n't
surprising
that
President
Bush
has
n't
led
a
crusade
to
pump
up
the
Contras
or
SDI
.

Though
he
nominally
supports
both
programs
,
Mr.
Bush
has
n't
been
a
passionate
champion
of
either
cause
,
as
Mr.
Reagan
was
.

What
's
surprising
is
that
there
is
n't
more
of
a
conservative
outcry
as
the
Bush
administration
lets
the
programs
slip
down
the
national-priority
list
.

A
combination
of
factors
--
a
weariness
among
some
conservatives
,
a
decline
in
the
perception
of
a
Soviet
threat
and
a
preoccupation
with
other
issues
--
seem
to
explain
the
strange
tranquility
.

Above
all
,
though
,
conservative
Republicans
who
have
championed
both
the
Contras
and
SDI
are
reluctant
to
attack
a
Republican
president
for
failing
to
do
more
--
though
that
reluctance
may
be
receding
.

``
We
want
to
complain
,
we
want
to
say
something
about
it
,
and
we
're
going
to
as
it
gets
worse
,
''
says
Rep.
Dan
Burton
,
an
Indiana
Republican
who
has
been
a
staunch
Contra
backer
.

``
But
it
's
like
kicking
your
father
in
the
pants
.

You
hate
to
do
it
because
he
's
your
father
.

''
Mr.
Burton
says
conservatives
'
unhappiness
with
Mr.
Bush
's
cautious
handling
of
the
recent
unsuccessful
coup
in
Panama
will
make
them
more
willing
to
speak
out
.

Of
course
,
neither
President
Bush
nor
the
Congress
has
actually
abandoned
the
Contras
or
SDI
.

Mr.
Bush
has
struck
a
deal
with
congressional
leaders
to
provide
nonlethal
aid
to
the
Contras
until
Nicaragua
holds
national
elections
next
February
.

But
the
administration
has
dropped
any
effort
to
win
military
aid
for
the
rebels
.

And
the
administration
's
deal
with
Congress
gives
several
congressional
committees
the
right
to
cut
off
even
humanitarian
aid
next
month
,
though
the
committees
are
likely
to
let
aid
continue
until
February
.

Most
analysts
think
there
's
little
prospect
the
Contras
can
be
a
significant
fighting
force
without
U.S.
arms
,
and
after
the
February
election
their
future
in
any
form
will
be
murky
at
best
.

Instead
of
focusing
on
the
Contras
,
Mr.
Bush
has
switched
to
urging
members
of
Congress
--
most
recently
in
a
White
House
meeting
yesterday
--
to
approve
financing
for
the
election
campaign
of
political
opponents
of
Nicaragua
's
Sandinista
government
.

The
administration
continues
to
support
SDI
,
or
Star
Wars
,
and
it
recently
lobbied
to
persuade
the
Senate
to
restore
some
of
the
funds
it
planned
to
cut
from
the
program
.

And
just
last
week
,
Defense
Secretary
Dick
Cheney
gave
a
strong
speech
listing
``
compelling
reasons
''
to
push
ahead
with
SDI
and
saying
he
'd
urge
President
Bush
to
veto
a
defense
bill
with
``
inadequate
''
funding
for
the
program
.

But
the
strong
pitch
by
Mr.
Cheney
may
be
too
little
too
late
to
prevent
damage
to
SDI
.

The
House
has
already
voted
for
a
deep
cut
in
funding
,
and
in
the
end
the
program
's
backers
will
be
hard
pressed
to
head
off
some
reduction
in
spending
next
year
.

And
while
the
defense
secretary
is
speaking
out
,
President
Bush
himself
has
n't
launched
any
high-visibility
campaign
to
drum
up
support
,
as
President
Reagan
did
.

The
administration
also
acknowledges
that
it
is
n't
pursuing
Mr.
Reagan
's
original
vision
of
an
``
impenetrable
shield
''
protecting
the
whole
U.S.
,
but
rather
a
more
modest
version
.

More
ominous
to
SDI
supporters
,
the
Bush
administration
appears
to
have
tacitly
accepted
a
new
arms-control
proposal
from
the
Soviet
Union
that
spells
long-term
trouble
for
Star
Wars
.

The
Soviets
have
agreed
to
complete
a
treaty
cutting
strategic
weapons
without
including
restrictions
on
space-based
defenses
.

But
the
Soviets
also
are
insisting
that
they
will
reserve
the
right
to
withdraw
from
the
completed
strategic-arms
treaty
later
on
if
the
U.S.
does
SDI
testing
or
deployment
that
the
Soviets
think
violates
the
existing
anti-ballistic-missile
treaty
.

It
will
be
hard
down
the
road
to
persuade
Congress
to
approve
money
for
SDI
plans
if
lawmakers
fear
those
plans
could
scuttle
a
completed
treaty
.

As
a
result
,
Frank
Gaffney
,
a
former
Reagan
Pentagon
aide
who
now
heads
the
Center
for
Security
Policy
,
charges
that
the
administration
's
``
professions
of
continued
commitment
to
development
and
deployment
of
the
SDI
program
strain
credulity
.

''
Still
,
proponents
may
be
shying
away
from
more
drumbeating
because
they
sense
political
tides
have
turned
against
arming
the
Nicaraguan
rebels
or
boosting
spending
on
SDI
--
particularly
when
the
public
perceives
the
Soviet
threat
is
declining
under
Mikhail
Gorbachev
.

In
fact
,
because
communism
seems
to
be
beating
a
global
retreat
,
some
conservatives
may
simply
be
so
pleased
that
their
anti-communist
philosophy
is
prevailing
that
they
do
n't
have
the
fire
at
the
moment
to
push
controversial
programs
.

``
The
short
of
it
is
that
the
most
hard-bitten
among
us
can
not
get
into
too
sour
a
mood
with
communism
collapsing
,
''
says
Mitchell
Daniels
,
a
former
Reagan
White
House
aide
who
now
is
president
of
the
Hudson
Institute
.

Some
activists
are
toiling
to
raise
the
profile
of
the
two
causes
.

But
they
say
they
ca
n't
make
much
headway
because
of
a
lack
of
willing
leaders
in
a
position
to
turn
the
tide
.

One
longtime
champion
of
these
programs
in
Congress
,
Republican
whip
Newt
Gingrich
of
Georgia
,
is
distracted
by
questions
about
his
ethics
,
conservatives
note
.

Other
conservative
champions
,
like
Wyoming
Republican
Sen.
Malcolm
Wallop
,
a
longtime
SDI
advocate
,
do
n't
have
the
clout
with
the
Bush
White
House
that
they
enjoyed
with
President
Reagan
.

Above
all
,
though
,
proponents
say
neither
the
Contra
nor
the
SDI
cause
can
be
pushed
much
further
without
more
presidential
support
.

``
For
there
to
be
wind
in
the
sails
of
any
program
,
the
chief
executive
has
to
be
blowing
in
the
sails
,
''
says
Rep.
Burton
.

All
this
causes
Rep.
Hyde
to
muse
about
an
alternate
way
to
drum
up
more
enthusiasm
.

``
What
I
'd
like
to
see
,
if
he
is
up
to
it
,
is
for
Reagan
to
take
to
the
hustings
to
regenerate
enthusiasm
for
SDI
,
''
the
congressman
says
.

We
're
sorry
to
report
that
on
Monday
President
Bush
accepted
the
resignation
of
William
Allen
as
chairman
of
the
U.S.
Civil
Rights
Commission
.

Mr.
Allen
,
appointed
by
President
Reagan
,
grew
understandably
tired
of
dealing
with
the
guerrilla
tactics
of
his
enemies
.

His
recent
speech
,
provocatively
titled
``
Blacks
?
Animals
?
Homosexuals
?
What
is
a
Minority
?
''
caused
an
uproar
when
its
title
leaked
out
.

Mr.
Allen
's
commissioners
voted
to
call
his
unread
speech
``
thoughtless
,
disgusting
and
unnecessarily
inflammatory
.

''
Commissioner
Mary
Francis
Berry
said
it
was
``
another
sad
episode
in
the
saga
of
the
unguided
missile
who
is
chairman
.

''
Rep.
Don
Edwards
,
the
California
Democrat
,
warned
Mr.
Allen
that
the
speech
would
be
``
outside
the
scope
of
the
commission
's
jurisdiction
.

''
Thomas
Stoddard
,
head
of
the
Lambda
Legal
Defense
Fund
,
called
the
prospect
of
the
speech
``
frankly
shocking
.

''
We
've
actually
read
the
speech
.

Mr.
Allen
began
it
with
a
warning
to
his
hosts
,
a
California
church
group
that
opposes
rights
for
homosexuals
.

He
said
that
other
participants
in
the
conference
``
do
not
believe
that
the
rights
of
Americans
should
be
guaranteed
to
citizens
who
are
homosexual
,
''
but
that
``
I
mean
to
persuade
you
to
the
opposite
view
.

''
He
recalled
to
the
audience
a
``
strange
,
infelicitous
''
analogy
he
once
heard
arguing
``
now
that
we
have
finally
recognized
that
American
blacks
have
rights
,
we
need
to
do
the
same
for
animals
.

''
Mr.
Allen
objected
to
this
analogy
because
it
seems
to
``
assimilate
the
status
of
blacks
to
that
of
animals
--
as
a
mere
project
of
charity
,
of
humaneness
.

''
Rights
on
such
a
basis
,
whether
for
blacks
or
homosexuals
,
are
``
mere
indulgences
,
''
he
said
,
subject
to
being
taken
back
.

He
says
the
title
of
his
speech
was
to
make
his
point
that
Americans
have
rights
as
individuals
,
not
as
members
of
certain
select
groups
.

His
speech
criticized
the
``
idiocy
of
notions
of
protected
groups
in
society
''
as
opposed
to
individual
equality
or
,
as
he
put
it
,
in
``
a
common
destiny
as
Americans
.

''
Instead
of
lobbying
for
special
treatment
,
Mr.
Allen
said
that
homosexuals
and
others
should
try
to
ensure
equal
treatment
under
the
law
and
not
aim
for
special
privileges
that
would
risk
``
invidious
retrenchment
with
government
complicity
.

''
This
hardly
sounds
like
an
anti-homosexual
screed
.

What
's
really
going
on
here
?
The
three
most
important
things
to
understand
about
Mr.
Allen
is
that
he
is
a
black
conservative
intellectual
--
a
triple
threat
to
the
liberal
establishment
.

Mr.
Allen
,
who
teaches
government
at
prestigious
Harvey
Mudd
College
in
California
and
will
remain
a
member
of
the
commission
,
has
spent
years
arguing
that
civil
rights
are
individuals
'
rights
.

He
last
made
waves
when
he
dared
to
defend
an
Indian
girl
who
had
been
adopted
by
non-Indian
parents
off
her
reservation
.

Mr.
Allen
quickly
ran
up
against
the
liberal
establishment
again
,
which
somehow
elevated
the
vague
concept
of
``
Indian
rights
''
above
the
rights
of
individual
Indians
.

There
is
a
huge
divide
between
Mr.
Allen
's
we're-all-in-this-together
view
and
the
divisive
litigation
approach
of
the
civil
rights
groups
.

Indeed
,
the
gap
is
so
large
that
Mr.
Allen
's
critics
refuse
to
engage
the
debate
.

Their
ridicule
of
him
is
no
substitute
for
argument
.

Their
effort
to
run
him
out
of
Washington
is
an
embarrassment
to
the
original
purpose
of
their
own
movement
.

We
hope
the
next
head
of
the
Civil
Rights
Commission
will
be
as
brave
as
Mr.
Allen
in
making
the
case
for
equality
of
civil
rights
.

Bearings
Inc.
said
its
chairman
,
John
R.
Cunin
,
will
retire
as
an
officer
of
the
company
on
Jan.
2
.

George
L.
LaMore
,
president
and
chief
executive
officer
,
will
become
chairman
and
chief
executive
upon
Mr.
Cunin
's
retirement
.

John
C.
Dannemiller
,
executive
vice
president
and
chief
operating
officer
,
will
become
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

Mr.
Cunin
,
65
years
old
,
was
chief
executive
of
the
distributor
of
bearings
and
power-transmission
products
from
1982
to
1988
.

He
will
continue
as
a
director
.

Mr.
LaMore
,
63
,
a
48-year
veteran
at
Bearings
,
has
been
president
since
1983
.

Mr.
Dannemiller
,
51
,
joined
Bearings
in
August
1988
from
Leaseway
Transportation
Corp.
,
where
he
was
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

He
has
been
a
Bearings
director
since
1985
.

The
appointments
are
part
of
a
planned
succession
at
the
company
.

Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
opened
a
major
U.S.
trade
exhibition
in
Moscow
and
spent
two
hours
touring
some
of
the
150
stalls
representing
such
blue-chip
companies
as
General
Motors
Corp.
,
International
Business
Machines
Corp.
and
Johnson
&
Johnson
.

At
the
Archer-Daniels-Midland
Co.
stand
,
Mrs.
Nelson
Rockefeller
,
a
board
member
,
offered
him
a
soy
burger
.

He
did
n't
bite
.

The
exhibition
by
the
U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Trade
and
Economic
Council
underscores
the
growing
U.S.
interest
in
that
nation
's
market
,
though
trade
between
the
two
countries
is
a
minuscule
$
3
billion
.

The
Soviet
president
and
his
prime
minister
,
Nikolai
Ryzhkov
,
spent
the
longest
time
,
about
15
minutes
,
at
the
IBM
stand
,
where
they
got
souvenir
computer-chip
key
rings
.

At
the
GM
stall
,
they
barely
looked
at
a
gleaming
Cadillac
,
preferring
to
talk
about
cooperation
possibilities
.

In
Beijing
,
meantime
,
China
opened
an
international
aviation
show
,
but
the
West
's
embargo
on
military
deals
and
uncertainty
about
the
nation
's
stability
kept
many
foreign
exhibitors
away
.

Officials
said
91
companies
from
14
countries
,
including
the
U.S.
,
had
displays

down
from
about
260
firms
from
more
than
20
countries

the
last
show
in
Japanese
air-conditioner
maker
Daikin
Industries
Ltd.
was
fined
two
million
yen
(
$
14,000
)
for
exporting
to
the
Soviet
Union
a
chemical
solution
that
could
be
used
in
missile-guidance
systems
.

A
Daikin
executive
in
charge
of
exports
when
the
high-purity
halogenated
hydrocarbon
was
sold
to
the
Soviets
in
1986
received
a
suspended
10-month
jail
sentence
.

Judge
Masaaki
Yoneyama
told
the
Osaka
District
Court
Daikin
's
``
responsibility
is
heavy
because
illegal
exports
lowered
international
trust
in
Japan
.

''
Sale
of
the
solution
in
concentrated
form
to
Communist
countries
is
prohibited
by
Japanese
law
and
by
international
agreement
.

A
Soviet
legislative
panel
rejected
as
not
radical
enough
a
government
proposal
on
decentralizing
economic
control
.

The
newspaper
Leninskoye
Zamya
said
the
committee
decided
the
plan
to
parcel
out
economic
powers
previously
exercised
by
Moscow
to
the
country
's
15
republics
``
does
n't
reflect
the
radical
changes
in
the
Soviet
federation
.

''
The
committee
gave
the
government
until
Nov.
15
to
revise
the
proposal
.

The
move
reflected
the
growing
confidence
of
the
revamped
Supreme
Soviet
.

Scott
Paper
Co.
said
it
is
abandoning
a
proposed
$
650
million
tree-farming
project
in
Indonesia
because
it
no
longer
expects
to
use
as
much
eucalyptus
pulp
as
previously
anticipated
.

The
eucalyptus
plantation
and
pulp
mill
,
which
would
have
covered
about
175,000
acres
in
the
Irian
Jaya
region
,
had
been
approved
by
Indonesia
's
investment
board
.

But
it
was
opposed
by
some
environmentalists
as
a
threat
to
Irian
Jaya
's
forests
and
a
potential
source
of
social
unrest
for
the
primitive
tribes
who
inhabit
them
.

Yaohan
Departmentstore

of
Japan
is
moving
its
international-operations
headquarters
and
holding
company
to
Hong
Kong
to
gain
from
the
British
colony

advantages
and
tax
structure
.

With

(
US$

,
the
new

,
Yaohan

to

Major
European
auction
houses
are
turning
increasingly
to
specialized
sales
.

Christie
's
will
soon
have
a
sale
of
Dada

Symbolist
art
while
Sotheby

is
luring
collectors
with
sales
of

German
,

Canadian
paintings
.

In

Grisebach
will
auction
art
works
with
pre-sale
estimates

1,600

.

The
auction
house
,
known
for
its
sales
of
top-drawer
19th
and
20th
century
works
,
is
providing
``
a
service
to
clients
who
do
n't
want
to
sell
just
their
fabulous
oil
paintings
,
''
says
Villa
Grisebach
's
Vivien
Reuter
.

Antwerp
auctioneer
Campo
is
less
concerned
with
market
niches
than
with
Belgium
's
crushing
tax
and
auction-fee
burden
.

``
Everything
has
to

says

Ending
tax-free
shopping
in
the
European
Community
after
1992
could
threaten
more
than
3,000
jobs
,
the
International
Duty
Free
Confederation
said
.

Instead
of
banning
such
shopping
,
the
confederation
proposed
amending
controls
to
be
sure
the
privilege
is
n't
abused

.

British
and
Argentine
diplomats
opened
talks
in
Madrid
aimed
at
restoring

severed
because
of
their
1982
war
over
the
Falkland

.

Britain

Polaroid
Corp.
,
benefiting
from
staff-reduction
savings
,
reported
a
strong
gain
in
third-quarter
operating
results
and
net
income
of
$
29.9
million
,
or
40
cents
a
share
,
after
preferred-stock
requirements
.

Analysts
said
the
numbers
were
better
than
expectations
,
partly
because
of
strong
profit
margins
and
a
positive
foreign-currency
translation
.

However
,
they
said
the
company
's
flat
revenue
was
a
disappointment
,
and
an
indication
that
sales
of
Polaroid
's
new
conventional
film
in
the
U.S.
have
been
sluggish
.

Revenue
in
the
third
quarter
was
$
437.7
million
,
almost
unchanged
from
$
436.3
million
a
year
earlier
.

Polaroid
reported
operating
profit
before
taxes
and
interest
costs
of
$
63.1
million
for
the
third
quarter
,
more
than
double
the
year-before
$
24
million
.

Charges
for
staff
cuts
and
other
restructuring
produced
a
net
loss
of
$
54.1
million
,
or
77
cents
a
share
,
in
1988
's
third
quarter
.

``
I
'm
somewhat
skeptical
about
the
underlying
demand
''
for
Polaroid
products
,
said
Michael
Ellmann
,
an
analyst
with
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

``
If
you
believe
that
a
good
performance
next
year
is
contingent
on
an
acceleration
of
revenue
,
there
is
n't
a
lot
here
to
base
optimism
on
.

''
Alex
Henderson
,
an
analyst
with
Prudential-Bache
,
says
Polaroid
officials
told
him
yesterday
that
U.S.
sales
of
the
company
's
new
conventional
film
product
,
introduced
in
the
second
quarter
,
have
been
``
disappointing
''
after
a
promising
start
.

Sam
Yanes
,
a
Polaroid
spokesman
,
said
``
I
do
n't
know
about
disappointing
,
''
but
added
that
the
company
has
n't
been
able
to
get
the
product
on
the
shelves
of
some
mass-merchandise
,
discount
retailers
that
it
had
hoped
would
be
carrying
the
product
already
.

Mr.
Yanes
said
the
film
,
One
Film
,
is
currently
carried
at
about
15,000
retail
outlets
,
including
drugstores
and
supermarkets
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Polaroid
reported
earnings
of
$
98.5
million
,
or
$
1.27
a
share

Last
year
,
the
company
had
a
nine-month
loss
of

15.1

23

a

Why
is
the
stock
market
suddenly
so
volatile
?
Yesterday
,
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
did
a
now
familiar
dance
:
It
plunged
60.25
points
before
lunch
,
with
most
of
the
drop
occurring
in
25
minutes
.

Then
,
it
rebounded
to
finish
down
only
18.65
points
.

And
those
swings
paled
beside
Friday
's
190.58-point
plunge
and
Monday
's
88.12-point
recovery
.

``
It
's
madness
--
that
in
an
hour
you
can
whack
off
so
much
value
,
''
says
Stanford
Calderwood
,
chairman
of
Trinity
Investment
Management
Corp.
,
Boston
.

And
,
apparently
,
it
is
here
to
stay
.

Richard
Bernstein
,
senior
quantitative
analyst
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
,
says
,
``
My
gut
feel
is
that
we
'll
live
with
those
swings
for
a
while
.

''
There
are
many
reasons
for
the
market
's
jumpiness
:
new
trading
vehicles
such
as
stock-index
futures
and
options
;
computer-driven
strategies
like
program
trading
;
and
crowd
psychology
.

But
most
are
linked
by
a
single
theme
:
liquidity
--
the
ability
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
market
quickly
.

Prices
are
moving
up
and
down
so
fast
because
investors
are
employing
ways
to
turn
over
shares
at
ever-faster
rates
and
increasingly
acting
in
concert
.

``
Institutions
are
herding
animals
,
''
says
Peter
Anderson
,
who
heads
the
pension-fund
management
arm
of
IDS
Financial
Services
Inc
.

``
We
watch
the
same
indicators
and
listen
to
the
same
prognosticators
.

Like
lemmings
,
we
tend
to
move
in
the
same
direction
at
same
time
.

''
And
that
,
naturally
,
exacerbates
price
movements
.

Institutions
--
who
now
account
for
most
trading
--
count
on
being
able
to
buy
and
sell
big
blocks
of
stock
at
an
eye-blink
.

But
when
they
discover
that
markets
are
n't
always
as
liquid
as
they
supposed
--
markets
jump
.

On
Monday
,
for
instance
,
Howard
Ward
,
a
principal
at
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
,
found
that
``
you
could
n't
buy
blue-chips
at
quoted
prices
without
paying
up
.

''
And
when
many
firms
had
to
``
pay
up
,
''
Monday
's
sudden
rally
was
sparked
.

Trading
in
futures
and
options
,
some
people
believe
,
can
add
to
volatility
.

Investors
believe
they
can
can
rely
on
such
derivative
securities
to
get
in
and
out
of
the
stock
market
without
actually
selling
any
stocks
;
that
is
,
a
way
of
staying
liquid
even
when
they
own
stocks
.

These
and
other
modern
trading
methods
``
tend
to
promote
dramatic
shifts
in
assets
,
''
says
George
Douglas
,
first
vice
president
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc
.

``
It
's
the
idea
that
what
goes
in
easy
can
come
out
easy
''
--
so
that
bouts
of
higher
volatility
get
built
into
the
stock
market
.

One
new
investment
style
called
``
asset
allocation
''
shifts
portfolio
weightings
between
stocks
,
bonds
and
cash
when
computer
models
say
one
is
more
attractive
.

For
instance
,
First
Quadrant
Corp.
,
an
asset
allocator
based
in
Morristown
,
N.J.
,
said
it
quickly
boosted
stock
positions
in
its
``
aggressive
''
accounts
to
75
%
from
55
%
to
take
advantage
of
plunging
prices
Friday
.

It
added
another
5
%
Monday
before
stocks
rallied
.

When
they
did
,
the
firm
reduced
those
stock
holdings
to
about
70
%
.

A
classic
example
of
institutions
'
hunger
for
liquidity
is
portfolio
insurance
,
now
widely
discredited
.

Before
the
1987
crash
,
an
estimated
$
60
billion
in
institutional
money
was
managed
under
this
hedging
technique
.

The
idea
was
to
``
insure
''
the
value
of
a
portfolio
by
selling
futures
when
stock
prices
dropped
--
eliminating
the
need
to
sell
the
stocks
themselves
.

But
in
October
1987
,
when
portfolio
insurers
rushed
to
sell
at
the
same
time
,
they
overwhelmed
both
the
stock
and
futures
markets
.

Yet
even
today
,
institutions
are
quietly
practicing
forms
of
portfolio
insurance
by
nervously
rushing
to
and
fro
in
the
markets
.

Others
are
doing
``
index
arbitrage
''
a
strategy
of
taking
advantage
of
price
discrepancies
between
stocks
and
futures
.

Unlike
traditional
buy-and-hold
strategies
,
all
of
the
above
require
that
market
makers
be
on
hand
to
provide
liquidity
by
buying
and
selling
stocks
in
a
crunch
.

But
institutions
say
Wall
Street
brokerage
firms
are
less
willing
to
make
markets
.

Brokers
do
n't
deny
that
.

Wall
Street
traders
say
that
,
with
institutional
brokerage
commissions
far
lower
than
in
the
1970s
,
securities
firms
ca
n't
afford
to
take
the
risk
of
buying
too
much
stock
.

``
I
think
everyone
's
a
little
more
leery
,
''
says
Jack
Baker
,
head
of
equity
trading
at
Shearon
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
The
institutions
have
driven
(
commission
)
rates
down
to
the
point
where
it
makes
no
sense
to
commit
capital
,
''
says
Tom
Gallagher
,
senior
executive
vice
president
in
charge
of
institutional
trading
at
Oppenheimer
&
Co
.

``
Why
should
I
risk
money
for
a
guy
for
who
's
paying
me
five
cents
a
dance
?
All
you
get
is
risk
.

''
Lack
of
liquidity
can
also
result
from
exchange
``
reforms
.

''
Many
traders
say
that
``
circuit
breakers
''
put
in
place
to
damp
volatility
after
the
1987
crash
actually
added
to
volatility
when
the
stock
market
plunged
Friday
.

The
circuit
breakers
caused
a
30-minute
shutdown
in
trading
in
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
contract
as
the
markets
were
falling
.

``
With
the
futures-trading
halt
,
you
could
only
sell
stocks
''
to
cut
exposure
to
the
market
,
says
a
money
manager
.

``
It
was
scary
to
people
thinking
that
they
could
n't
get
their
trades
off
.

''
``
It
was
like
they
put
you
in
a
room
with
a
gorilla
and
told
you
there
were
three
doors
to
exit
,
''
said
one
Chicago-based
futures
trader
.

``
Then
they
said
,
`
By
the
way
,
two
of
the
doors
are
locked
.

'
''
The
takeover
mania
also
adds
to
volatility
.

UAL
Corp.
is
a
good
example
.

Valued
as
a
buy-out
target
,
the
airline
stock
was
trading
at
nearly
$
280
a
share
.

When
the
deal
ran
into
trouble
,
the
stock
tumbled
;
it
closed
at
$
198
yesterday
.

Presumably
,
UAL
is
now
trading
closer
to
its
value
based
on
earnings
.

By
contrast
,
traditional
buy-and-hold
investors
are
unlikely
to
generate
sudden
price
moves
.

Scott
Black
,
a
value-oriented
money
manager
who
heads
Delphi
Management
Inc.
,
points
out
that
for
those
who
invest
on
fundamentals
,
``
the
value
of
a
stock
from
day
to
day
does
n't
change
all
that
much
.

''
Some
experts
say
markets
are
n't
as
volatile
as
widely
assumed
.

Hans
Stoll
,
finance
professor
at
Vanderbilt
University
,
says
the
current
volatility
in
U.S.
markets
pales
in
comparison
to
the
1930s
,
decades
before
derivative
instruments
such
as
options
and
futures
were
introduced
.

``
I
just
ca
n't
believe
that
the
innovations
in
the
financial
market
are
causing
any
of
this
volatility
,
''
he
says
.

And
Robert
D.
Arnott
,
president
of
asset
allocator
First
Quadrant
,
notes
that
before
Friday
's
tailspin
,
daily
volatility
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
in
recent
weeks
had
reached
``
historically
low
levels
.

''
Some
people
tend
to
ignore
that
a
50-point
move
is
less
in
percentage
terms
than
it
was
when
the
stock
market
was
lower
.

John
J.
Phelan
Jr.
,
chairman
of
the
Big
Board
,
asserts
that
``
1988
and
1989
have
been
two
of
the
least
volatile
years
in
the
last
30
or
40
years
.

''
But
the
low
average
volatility
Mr.
Phelan
is
talking
about
is
n't
any
comfort
in
a
period
of
rapid
stock-market
moves
like
the
past
week
.

In
addition
,
Sanford
Grossman
,
a
Wharton
School
finance
professor
,
says
volatile
jumps
in
stock
prices
will
continue
as
long
as
liquidity
falls
short
of
the
voracious
demands
of
institutions
``
who
can
go
out
and
say
`
I
have
a
billion
dollars
of
stocks
to
sell
.

'
''
Some
people
think
the
search
for
liquidity
is
fruitless
.

In
1936
,
John
Maynard
Keynes
wrote
that
``
of
the
maxims
of
orthodox
finance
none
,
surely
,
is
more
antisocial
than
the
fetish
of
liquidity
.

''
It
leads
investors
to
focus
on
short-term
price
movements
--
``
a
game
of
musical
chairs
,
''
he
called
it
--
rather
than
on
long-term
fundamental
valuation
.

James
A.
White
contributed
to
this
article
.

The
National
Aeronautics
and
Space
Administration
said
a
computer
virus
has
infected
one
of
its
networks
and
is
spreading
anti-nuclear
messages
related
to
its
Galileo
space
probe
,
which
is
to
be
launched
today
.

Charles
Redmond
,
a
NASA
spokesman
,
said
the
agency
discovered
the
virus
on
Monday
on
the
collection
of
computer
networks
collectively
called
Internet
and
expected
100
university
centers
to
be
infected
by
today
.

Although
the
network
is
n't
connected
to
the
computer
systems
that
operate
either
Galileo
or
the
shuttle
,
part
of
the
network
will
carry
analyses
of
Galileo
data
once
the
craft
gets
spaceborn
.

Mr.
Redmond
said
the
intruder
had
n't
yet
done
any
harm
but
the
agency
feared
``
garbage
data
could
be
substituted
for
real
data
.

''
He
estimated
it
could
take
a
day
for
a
computer
security
manager
to
expunge
the
virus
from
a
computer
system
.

The
intruder
,
among
the
broadest
yet
to
hit
a
research
network
,
appeared
to
affect
only
Digital
Equipment
Corp.
hardware
that
uses
Digital
's
operating
system
.

It
is
unrelated
to
the
much-publicized
virus
that
last
year
infected
Arpanet
,
a
much
larger
network
used
by
researchers
at
universities
,
laboratories
and
government
agencies
around
the
world
.

In
the
lingo
of
computer
security
,
the
NASA
intruder
is
technically
a
computer
worm
,
Mr.
Redmond
said
.

A
worm
resides
in
the
operating
system
of
a
computer
and
spreads
by
boring
into
other
computers
contacted
through
networks
.

The
Galileo
worm
apparently
was
hatched
on
a
computer
in
France
hooked
up
to
NASA
's
Space
Physics
Analysis
Network
,
Mr.
Redmond
said
.

NASA
said
the
Galileo
worm
had
n't
affected
its
computers
or
the
computers
of
other
government
agencies
because
they
had
modified
their
systems
to
reject
worms
.

But
Mr.
Redmond
said
the
worm
hit
universities
that
had
n't
elected
to
make
the
changes
.

Michael
Alexander
,
a
senior
editor
at
Computerworld
,
a
trade
publication
,
said
he
was
told
that
the
worm
gets
into
a
computer
center
by
looking
for
obvious
passwords
--
such
as
ones
that
are
the
same
as
the
user
's
name
.

If
it
finds
one
and
gets
into
the
system
,
it
will
display
a
screen
when
a
user
logs
on
that
says
,
``
Worms
Against
Nuclear
Killers
...
.

You
talk
of
times
of
peace
for
all
,
and
then
prepare
for
war
.

''
In
addition
,
Mr.
Alexander
said
,
the
worm
sends
strange
messages
to
other
machines
at
the
center
--
such
as
,
``
George
Orwell
was
an
optimist
,
''
or
``
Do
n't
feed
the
bats
tonight
.

''
The
worm
also
looks
for
elementary
passwords
that
confer
more
privileges
on
the
user
.

The
passwords
are
included
in
the
system
software
when
it
is
installed
but
are
supposed
to
be
replaced
as
soon
as
the
system
is
up
and
running
.

If
it
finds
one
of
those
passwords
,
Mr.
Alexander
said
,
the
worm
will
do
such
things
as
change
users
'
passwords
to
a
series
of
random
numbers
,
preventing
them
from
signing
on
to
the
network
.

NASA
estimated
that
,
on
Monday
,
about
four
computer
centers
were
affected
.

Yesterday
,
the
number
grew
to
40
;
today
the
number
is
expected
to
grow
to
100
.

NASA
said
it
will
take
about
a
week
before
it
knows
exactly
how
many
centers
of
the
6,000
connected
to
Internet
were
affected
and
the
extent
of
the
damage
,
if
any
.

Anti-nuclear
activists
have
protested
the
launch
of
the
Galileo
space
probe
to
Jupiter
because
it
uses
plutonium
to
generate
the
electricity
needed
to
run
the
craft
.

Activists
fear
that
if
the
shuttle
carrying
Galileo
into
orbit
should
explode
,
or
if
Galileo
itself
crashes
into
the
Earth
during
the
two
times
it
flies
close
to
the
planet
,
fatal
levels
of
plutonium
would
be
released
into
the
atmosphere
.

So
far
Galileo
has
been
delayed
twice
,
once
because
of
a
computer
malfunction
connected
with
a
space-shuttle
engine
,
and
yesterday
because
of
the
weather
.

NASA
said
the
Galileo
worm
had
nothing
to
do
with
either
delay
.

Mr.
Alexander
of
Computerworld
said
hackers
have
gone
after
SPAN
before
.

He
said
the
Chaos
Computer
Club
,
of
West
Germany
,
once
managed
to
invade
SPAN
and
do
such
things
as
change
the
value
of
pi
,
messing
up
some
calculations
.

It
is
now
a
commonplace
that
prosecutors
are
bringing
criminal
indictments
in
cases
where
until
a
few
years
ago
only
a
civil
action
at
most
would
have
been
brought
.

Yet
it
is
also
axiomatic
that
the
power
to
create
new
crimes
belongs
only
to
the
legislature
,
and
not
to
courts
.

Beginning
in
the
early
19th
century
,
with
U.S.
v.
Hudson
and
Goodwin
,
the
Supreme
Court
has
repeatedly
held
that
a
judicial
power
to
declare
conduct
to
be
against
the
public
interest
and
hence
criminal
,
while
well
established
in
British
law
,
would
usurp
legislative
authority
under
the
doctrine
of
separation
of
powers
.

That
's
the
conventional
theory
anyway
.

In
practice
,
however
,
the
line
between
interpretation
and
redefinition
of
the
criminal
law
long
ago
began
to
blur
.

In
particular
,
a
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
has
developed
with
surprising
rapidity
over
the
past
decade
.

For
example
,
although
insider
trading
has
long
been
criminal
,
it
has
never
been
statutorily
defined
.

In
1983
,
the
Supreme
Court
tried
to
supply
a
workable
definition
in
the
Dirks
v.
SEC
decision
,
which
found
that
liability
depended
on
whether
the
tipper
had
breached
his
fiduciary
duty
to
the
corporation
in
order
to
obtain
``
some
personal
gain
''
and
whether
the
tippee
knew
or
recklessly
disregarded
this
fact
.

Gradually
,
however
,
lower
courts
and
prosecutors
have
pushed
this
definition
to
its
breaking
point
.

Consider
the
facts
underlying
the
1989
conviction
of
Robert
Chestman
.

Prior
to
a
tender
offer
by
A&P
for
Waldbaum
Inc.
in
1986
,
the
founder
of
the
Waldbaum
's
supermarket
chain
called
an
elderly
relative
to
tell
her
to
assemble
her
stock
certificates
for
delivery
.

She
called
her
daughter
to
take
her
to
the
bank
,
who
,
in
turn
,
persuaded
her
husband
,
a
Mr.
Loeb
,
to
run
this
errand
.

Hearing
of
this
information
,
the
husband
discussed
it
with
his
broker
,
Mr.
Chestman
,
and
Mr.
Chestman
then
bought
for
his
own
account
and
other
clients
.

Basically
,
Mr.
Chestman
was
a
fourth-level
tippee
.

Did
Mr.
Loeb
,
his
tipper
,
breach
a
fiduciary
duty
(
and
,
if
so
,
to
whom
)
?
Did
Mr.
Loeb
seek
personal
gain
(
and
if
so
,
how
)
?
Or
did
Mr.
Chestman
only
hear
a
market
rumor
(
which
one
may
lawfully
trade
upon
)
?
The
line
seems
awfully
thin
for
criminal-law
purposes
.

A
second
illustration
is
supplied
by
the
recent
guilty
plea
entered
by
Robert
Freeman
,
formerly
head
of
arbitrage
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

Essentially
,
Mr.
Freeman
had
invested
heavily
in
the
Beatrice
leveraged
buy-out
,
when
he
was
told
by
another
prominent
trader
,
Bernard
``
Bunny
''
Lasker
,
that
the
deal
was
in
trouble
.

After
placing
orders
to
sell
,
Mr.
Freeman
called
Martin
Siegel
,
an
investment
banker
at
Kidder
,
Peabody
&
Co.
,
who
was
advising
on
the
deal
,
to
confirm
these
rumors
.

Mr.
Siegel
asked
Mr.
Freeman
who
his
source
was
and
,
on
hearing
that
it
was
Bunny
Lasker
,
responded
:
``
Well
,
your
bunny
has
a
good
nose
.

''
The
illegal
``
tip
''
of
the
bunny
's
good
nose
was
then
largely
a
confirmation
of
rumors
already
known
to
many
in
the
market
.

Had
the
case
gone
to
trial
the
same
issues
would
have
surfaced
:
Was
there
a
fiduciary
breach
in
order
to
obtain
personal
gain
?
Did
Mr.
Freeman
have
notice
of
this
?
Finally
,
was
the
information
material
?
Yet
,
all
these
issues
are
subsidiary
to
a
more
central
issue
:
Who
is
and
who
should
be
making
the
criminal
law
here
?
It
is
not
my
contention
that
either
Mr.
Chestman
or
Mr.
Freeman
was
an
innocent
victim
of
prosecutorial
overzealousness
.

Arguably
,
both
were
on
notice
that
their
behavior
was
at
least
risky
.

But
even
if
they
behaved
recklessly
,
reasons
still
exist
to
fear
and
resist
this
steady
process
of
case-by-case
judicial
extension
of
the
law
of
insider
trading
.

Courts
and
legislatures
make
decisions
in
very
different
ways
and
are
each
susceptible
to
very
different
kinds
of
errors
.

After-the-fact
judicial
examination
of
an
actor
's
conduct
has
always
been
the
common
law
's
method
.

When
only
civil
liability
is
involved
,
this
method
has
the
undeniable
strengths
of
factual
specificity
and
avoidance
of
overgeneralization
.

Still
,
case-by-case
retrospective
decision
making
of
this
sort
is
vulnerable
to
the
tunnel
vision
caused
by
a
fixation
on
ad
hoc
(
and
usually
sleazy
)
examples
.

When
a
court
decides
that
a
particular
actor
's
conduct
was
culpable
and
so
extends
the
definition
of
insider
trading
to
reach
this
conduct
,
it
does
not
see
the
potentially
enormous
number
of
other
cases
that
will
be
covered
by
the
expanded
rule
.

Thus
,
a
court
is
poorly
positioned
to
make
judgments
about
the
social
utility
of
the
expanded
rule
.

For
example
,
in
focusing
on
Mr.
Freeman
's
attempt
to
gain
nonpublic
information
about
a
deal
's
collapse
,
one
does
not
naturally
think
about
the
reverse
side
of
the
coin
:
What
if
the
rumor
had
been
false
?
Can
a
security
analyst
call
an
investment
banker
to
make
certain
that
a
seemingly
improbable
rumor
is
in
fact
false
?
In
the
past
,
not
only
would
reputable
professionals
have
rushed
to
check
out
such
rumors
with
the
company
,
but
companies
listed
on
the
major
stock
exchanges
were
encouraged
by
the
exchanges
to
respond
openly
to
such
inquiries
from
securities
analysts
.

Today
,
after
Mr.
Freeman
's
plea
,
there
is
an
uncertainty
that
is
both
unfair
and
inefficient
.

In
this
light
,
the
comparative
advantages
of
legislative
law-making
become
clear
:
(
1
)
Before
it
acts
,
the
legislature
typically
will
hear
the
views
of
representatives
of
all
those
affected
by
its
decision
,
not
just
the
immediate
parties
before
the
court
;
and
(
2
)
the
legislature
can
frame
``
bright
line
''
standards
that
create
less
uncertainty
than
the
fact-bound
decisions
of
courts
.

Although
legislative
lines
can
result
in
under-inclusion
(
which
explains
why
the
SEC
has
long
resisted
a
legislative
definition
of
insider
trading
)
,
judicial
lawmaking
inevitably
creates
uncertainty
because
of
the
shadowy
outer
edges
and
implications
of
most
judicial
decisions
.

At
least
when
the
stakes
are
high
,
uncertainty
in
turn
results
in
overinclusion
,
as
individuals
do
not
dare
to
approach
an
uncertain
line
closely
.

The
federal
mail
and
wire
fraud
statutes
provide
even
better
illustrations
of
the
rapid
evolution
of
a
federal
common
law
of
white-collar
crime
.

In
1987
,
the
Supreme
Court
attempted
in
McNally
v.
U.S.
to
halt
the
inexorable
expansion
of
these
statutes
by
adopting
a
rule
of
strict
construction
for
ambiguous
criminal
statues
.

Yet
,
late
last
year
,
Congress
effectively
reversed
this
decision
by
enacting
a
one-sentence
statute
that
defined
fraud
to
include
any
scheme
to
deprive
another
of
``
the
intangible
right
of
honest
services
.

''
At
a
stroke
,
this
may
criminalize
all
fiduciary
breaches
(
and
possibly
all
misrepresentations
by
an
agent
or
employee
)
.

Such
a
statute
illustrates
the
fundamental
problem
:
Congress
finds
it
is
easier
to
pass
sweepingly
moralistic
prohibitions
,
which
the
courts
must
thereafter
interpret
,
than
to
engage
in
the
difficult
line-drawing
distinctions
that
are
inherently
its
responsibility
.

We
are
confronted
less
with
a
judicial
power
grab
than
with
a
legislative
giveaway
.

Predictably
,
when
confronted
with
morally
dubious
behavior
,
prosecutors
will
exploit
the
latitude
such
openended
statutes
give
them
.

Over
the
long
run
,
however
,
sleazy
cases
will
make
bad
law
.

Corning
Inc.
posted
a
38
%
decline
in
third-quarter
net
income
to
$
76.5
million
,
or
80
cents
a
share
,
from
$
123.9
million
,
or
$
1.37
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
year-earlier
figure
included
a
one-time
gain
of
$
59.9
million
from
the
sale
of
Corning
's
stakes
in
Japanese
businesses
.

Without
the
gain
,
operating
profit
was
$
64
million
,
or
71
cents
a
share
.

The

,

glass
,
ceramic
products
and

the

Corning

,
James
R.
Houghton
,
said
operating
performance
continued
to
be
strong
in
the
telecommunications
and
health
and
science
segments
.

But
the
specialty-material
segment
slowed
somewhat
and
consumer
products
continued
below
expectations
.

As
for
joint
ventures
,
Mr.
Houghton
said
profit
was
``
essentially
flat
''
due
primarily
to
a
slow
recovery
at
Samsung-Corning
Co.
in
Korea
following
a
strike
at
a
major
customer
and
the
disruption
of
shipments
to
China
.

Also
,
profit
was
hurt
by
the
strength
of
the
dollar
overseas
which
negatively
affected
the
company
's
currency-exchange
rate
.

and
the

The

show
that

remains
fragile

volatile
--
ready
to
jump
at
the

rumor
--
a
few
days
after
its

.

Nervous

UAL
,
which

n't
finance
,
represents
the
future
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
ingredients
in
the
bull
market
-
corporate
restructuring
.

An
important
element
of
this
phenomenon
--
the
now-shaky

for
junk

,
used
often
to
finance
restructurings

continued

leveraged-buy-out

Investors
can
get
slightly
higher
yields
on
deposits
below
$
50,000
than
they
can
on
deposits
of
$
90,000
and
up
.

``
Banks
want
to
remain
competitive
,
''
said
Norberto
Mehl
,
chairman
of
Banxquote
.

``
October
is
a
big
rollover
month
and
perhaps
they
anticipate
greater
demand
...
among
people
leaving
the
stock
market
.

''
Some
bankers
are
reporting
more
inquiries
than
usual
about
CDs
since
Friday
.

``
Reports
from
branches
are
that
there
has
been
greater
interest
in
the
last
day
or
so
,
''
said
Steven
Braitman
,
a
vice
president
at
Chemical
Bank
in
New
York
.

Chemical
said
deposits
Monday
were
about
$
5
million
higher
than
usual
and
it
expects
more
activity
as
investors
receive
the
proceeds
from
sales
of
stock
.

``
This
is
no
time
to
be
playing
in
the
street
...
the
Dow

more
ups
and
downs
than
an

,
''
proclaimed
an
advertisement
Monday
in
New
York
newspapers
,
touting
Lincoln
Savings
Bank
's
one-year
CD
.

Harold
Jones
,
Lincoln
's
chief
retail
banking
officer
,
said
there
has
n't
yet
been
``
a
discernible
response
,
''
although
the
ad
included
a
coupon
that
could
arrive
later
in
the
week
.

Friday
's
market
rout
came
smack
in
the
middle
of
the
heaviest
month
for
CD
rollovers
,
when
a
number
of
banks
and
thrifts
already
have
promotions
under
way
.

First
National
Bank
of
Boston
,
for
example
,
is
offering
certain
new
depositors
an
extra
quarter
of
a
percentage
point
on
six-month
and
12-month
CDs
.

Some
banks
actually
boosted
yields
on
the
shortest
term
CDs
in
the
latest
week
.

New
York
's
Citibank
,
for
instance
,
increased
the
yield
on
small-denomination
three-month
CDs
to
8
%
from
7.9
%
.

On
average
,
however
,
three-month
CDs
at
major
banks
are
yielding
a
tenth
of
a
percentage
point
less
than
they
were
a
week
ago
.

Average
yields
on
CDs
aimed
at
individual
investors
fell
less
than
half
as
much
as
yields
on
Treasury
bills
sold
at
Monday
's
auction
.

Six-month
CDs
of
$
50,000
and
less
yielded
an
average
8.02
%
in
the
week
ended
Tuesday
,
down
from
8.10
%
,
according
to
Banxquote
.

The
yield
on
six-month
T-bills
fell
to
7.82
%
on
Monday
,
from
8.01
%
the
week
before
.

Meanwhile
,
the
average
yield
on
six-month
CDs
of
more
than
$
90,000
fell
to
7.93
%
in
the
latest
week
,
according
to
Banxquote
,
from
8.10
%
the
week
before
.

Mr.
Mehl
noted
that
actual
rates
are
almost
identical
on
small
and
large-denomination
CDs
,
but
yields
on
CDs
aimed
at
the
individual
investor
are
boosted
by
more
frequent
compounding
.

CDs
sold
by
major
brokerage
houses
,
which
like
jumbo
CDs
tend
to
closely
follow
interest
rate
trends
,
also
posted
larger
drops
in
yields
.

A
six-month
,
broker-sold
CD
,
for
example
,
was
yielding
an
average
8.09
%
in
the
latest
week
,
a
fifth
of
a
percentage
point
lower
than
the
week
before
.

In
late
April
,
when
interest
rates
were
at
their
recent
highs
,
short-term
CDs
sold
by
brokers
were
offering
yields
half
a
percentage
point
or
more
higher
than
banks
.

CD
yields
are
generally
expected
to
fall
further
in
coming
weeks
.

``
What
happened
in
the
stock
market
and
the
bigger
trade
deficit
''
reported
yesterday
``
make
it
unlikely
that
short-term
interest
rates
will
rise
''
any
time
soon
,
said
Mr.
Mehl
of
Banxquote
.

``
Even
before
the
market
drop
,
rates
were
down
about
half
a
percentage
point
,
''
said
Robert
J.
Hutchinson
,
senior
vice
president
for
retail
marketing
at
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
Co.
in
New
York
.

``
That
puts
pressure
on
CD
rates
.

''
Conservatives
have
an
important
decision
to
make
this
fall
.

At
the
recent
meetings
of
the
World
Bank
and
International
Monetary
Fund
,
the
Bush
administration
announced
its
intention
to
decide
by
yearend
the
size
of
the
next
increase
in
the
IMF
's
capital
base
.

While
the
U.S.
share
of
the
increase
probably
will
not
reach
the
$
12
billion
or
more
implicit
in
the
IMF
's
request
for
a
doubling
of
its
$
90
billion
capital
,
the
administration
probably
will
agree
to
a
multibillion-dollar
increase
.

This
would
be
consistent
with
its
unwavering
support
for
the
Brady
Plan
and
G-7
exchange-rate
intervention
,
and
with
its
financial
commitment
to
Mexico
,
Poland
and
others
.

The
IMF
has
several
reasons
for
requesting
the
increase
.

Its
role
in
the
economies
of
developing
countries
has
grown
steadily
since
the
1970s
.

The
size
and
pace
of
disbursements
will
accelerate
further
under
the
Brady
Plan
,
which
promises
larger
and
earlier
disbursements
to
approved
countries
.

At
least
three
other
factors
have
encouraged
the
IMF
to
insist
on
increased
capital
.

First
,
it
argues
that
its
capital
base
must
be
increased
in
order
to
maintain
its
size
relative
to
world
financial
markets
,
for
which
it
feels
some
responsibility
.

Second
,
the
World
Bank
's
recent
$
75
billion
capital
increase
--
$
14
billion
from
the
U.S.
--
has
left
the
IMF
feeling
less
than
first
fiddle
among
international
financial
institutions
.

Third
,
the
IMF
would
like
to
meet
Japan
's
request
for
increased
ownership
(
currently
4.5
%
)
.

Japan
has
supported
a
larger
role
for
the
IMF
in
developing-country
debt
issues
,
and
is
an
important
financial
resource
for
IMF-guided
programs
in
developing
countries
.

While
international
politics
may
argue
for
the
capital
increase
,
there
is
a
clear
economic
case
against
it
.

Opponents
of
the
increase
argue
that
the
IMF
practices
central
planning
while
supporting
ineffective
governments
.

They
question
whether
the
IMF
has
any
role
in
developing
countries
,
given
its
original
mandate
to
assist
industrial
countries
in
balance-of-payments
emergencies
.

Opponents
show
that
there
are
already
more
funds
available
than
commendable
reform
efforts
.

They
worry
that
new
IMF
funding
of
developing
countries
will
simply
end
up
substituting
IMF
debt
for
reschedulable
commercial
bank
debt
,
a
bad
trade
all
around
.

They
believe
microeconomics
,
which
addresses
the
problems
of
markets
,
investment
climate
and
management
practices
,
is
the
key
to
developing-country
growth
,
not
the
IMF
's
Keynesian
focus
on
trade
deficits
,
quarterly
targets
and
government
debt
.

They
point
at
the
numerous
developing-country
governments
that
have
inflated
,
taxed
and
regulated
themselves
into
despair
under
successive
IMF
programs
.

Decisions
on
increases
in
the
IMF
's
capital
base
traditionally
are
made
by
the
administration
,
with
subsequent
authorization
by
Congress
.

The
last
U.S.
congressional
authorization
,
in
1983
,
was
a
political
donnybrook
and
carried
a
$
6
billion
housing
program
along
with
it
to
secure
adequate
votes
.

The
politics
of
the
1990
congressional
authorization
are
likely
to
be
similar
to
those
of
previous
authorizations
.

Liberals
may
support
the
stabilizing
,
quasi-governmental
role
of
the
IMF
on
two
conditions
:
that
the
administration
give
assurances
that
liberal
Democrats
'
support
will
not
be
used
against
them
in
congressional
re-election
campaigns
;
and
that
the
legislation
address
--
with
dollars
--
social
and
environmental
concerns
.

Conservative
Republicans
will
be
given
the
choice
of
supporting
or
fighting
their
party
's
popular
president
in
an
election
year
.

A
U.S.
decision
to
refuse
the
IMF
its
capital
increase
,
or
limit
it
to
25
%
,
would
bring
a
major
change
in
international
economic
policy
,
and
could
not
be
taken
lightly
.

Commentators
would
fret
over
the
implications
for
the
G-7
coordination
process
and
the
stability
of
world
financial
markets
.

Because
commercial
banks
and
the
developing-country
governments
believe
they
will
get
a
piece
of
any
capital
increase
,
a
scaled-down
IMF
mission
would
leave
both
feeling
shortchanged
.

Furthermore
,
a
U.S.
rejection
of
the
capital
increase
(
and
transfer
of
shares
to
Japan
)
would
give
Japan
an
argument
against
future
calls
for
economic
burden-sharing
.

On
the
other
hand
,
a
decision
to
increase
the
IMF
's
capital
would
reinforce
the
central
economic
role
of
multilateral
institutions
in
developing
countries
.

With
the
increase
,
even
more
developing-country
energy
and
talent
would
be
diverted
from
creating
profitable
economic
systems
to
setting
up
economic
planning
ministries
that
generate
IMF-approved
economic
plans
.

Upping
the
ante
could
slow
economic
development
even
further
,
as
countries
delay
market-opening
steps
in
anticipation
of
richer
multilateral
support
.

Conservatives
should
take
a
position
prior
to
the
administration
's
year-end
deadline
.

The
issues
are
too
important
to
be
left
to
the
financial
and
budget
ministries
fighting
over
the
size
of
the
capital
increase
,
rather
than
its
purpose
.

If
conservatives
do
n't
support
an
increase
in
the
IMF
's
capital
,
then
it
is
incumbent
on
them
to
speak
up
now
and
explain
the
alternative
.

Mr.
Malpass
directs
the
Republican
staff
of
the
Joint
Economic
Committee
of
Congress
.

The
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
fined
and
suspended
two
commodities
traders
accused
of
making
prearranged
trades
with
each
other
that
allegedly
cheated
a
customer
.

Merc
officials
said
Gary
N.
Roberts
was
disciplined
following
the
exchange
's
investigation
of
his
trading
in
several
commodities
pits
from
July
to
November
1988
.

The
Merc
said
Mr.
Roberts
withheld
from
the
market
certain
orders
in
cooperation
with
another
trader
,
David
Stein
.

The
Merc
fined
Mr.
Roberts
$
15,000
and
suspended
his
trading
membership
for
three
years
.

Also
,
he
and
Mr.
Stein
were
ordered
to
make
restitution
of
$
35,000
to
a
customer
.

Mr.
Stein
was
fined
$
25,000
and
suspended
for
three
years
.

Messrs.
Roberts
and
Stein
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

The
Merc
said
that
as
part
of
the
disciplinary
settlement
,
neither
man
admitted
,
nor
denied
the
alleged
violations
.

Neither
was
among
the
46
traders
indicted
last
August
in
a
federal
investigation
of
traders
at
both
the
Merc
and
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

In
a
move
that
could
pose
a
new
competitive
challenge
to
Time
Warner
Inc.
's
powerful
Home
Box
Office
,
cable
giant
Tele-Communications
Inc.
agreed
to
buy
half
of
Showtime
Networks
Inc.
from
Viacom
Inc.
for
$
225
million
.

The
purchase
comes
after
nearly
three
years
of
on-again
off-again
talks
between
TCI
and
Viacom
,
which
has
also
discussed
the
sale
of
an
interest
in
Showtime
with
other
cable
operators
.

Showtime
is
a
distant
No.
2
to
Home
Box
Office
,
and
in
May
filed
a
$
2.5
billion
antitrust
suit
against
Time
Warner
,
charging
the
company
and
its
HBO
and
American
Television
cable
units
with
conspiring
to
monopolize
the
pay
TV
business
.

HBO
has
close
to
24
million
subscribers
to
its
HBO
and
Cinemax
networks
,
while
Showtime
and
its
sister
service
,
The
Movie
Channel
,
have
only
about
10
million
,
according
to
Paul
Kagan
Associates
,
a
Carmel
,
Calif.
,
research
firm
.

For
TCI
,
the
investment
in
Showtime
puts
it
in
an
unusual
position
;
as
the
largest
cable
operator
,
with
control
of
close
to
12
million
of
the
nation
's
52
million
cable
subscribers
,
TCI
is
HBO
's
largest
customer
.

But
TCI
President
John
Malone
has
long
been
concerned
about
HBO
's
dominance
of
the
pay
TV
business
,
and
has
been
eager
to
keep
Showtime
as
a
healthy
competitor
.

``
It
is
important
to
the
cable
industry
that
we
have
a
vibrant
and
competitive
pay-television
marketplace
,
''
Mr.
Malone
said
in
a
statement
.

In
a
telephone
interview
,
Robert
Thomson
,
TCI
senior
vice
president
,
said
Showtime
's
suit
against
HBO
``
does
n't
involve
us
,
and
nothing
we
're
doing
here
bears
any
relationship
to
that
.

''
He
added
,
``
We
do
n't
intend
to
be
drawn
into
it
,
''
noting
that
TCI
wo
n't
play
any
active
role
in
the
management
of
Showtime
.

Linking
up
Showtime
with
the
largest
cable
operator
in
the
U.S.
could
sharply
boost
its
subscribers
.

TCI
said
it
may
bring
in
other
cable
operators
as
investors
,
a
practice
it
has
employed
in
the
past
with
investments
in
other
cable
networks
,
such
as
The
Discovery
Channel
.

Additional
cable
partners
could
boost
subscribers
even
further
.

Time
Warner
declined
comment
.

In
addition
to
owning
HBO
,
Time
Warner
owns
American
Television
&
Communications
Inc.
,
the
nation
's
second
largest
cable
operator
after
TCI
.

Viacom
also
owns
cable
systems
,
but
it
is
the
14th
largest
operator
of
such
systems
,
with
less
than
one
million
subscribers
.

The
TCI
investment
is
a
big
victory
for
Viacom
's
chief
executive
officer
,
Frank
Biondi
,
and
Winston
H.
Cox
,
president
of
the
Showtime
unit
.

``
This
takes
any
question
of
Showtime
's
viability
and
puts
it
away
once
and
for
all
,
''
Mr.
Biondi
said
in
a
telephone
interview
.

The
fight
between
HBO
and
Showtime
is
particularly
acrimonious
because
Mr.
Biondi
is
the
former
chief
executive
of
HBO
,
and
Mr.
Cox
served
as
chief
of
marketing
for
the
service
.

They
were
both
hired
by
Sumner
Redstone
,
the
Boston
billionaire
who
took
control
of
Viacom
three
years
ago
in
a
leveraged
buy-out
.

Time
Warner
has
vigorously
denied
all
of
Viacom
's
allegations
.

Boeing
Co.
,
already
struck
by
its
Machinists
union
,
briefly
called
off
contract
talks
with
its
engineers
and
labeled
their
demands
``
grossly
excessive
.

''
Later
,
however
,
the
company
agreed
to
meet
on
Monday
with
the
Seattle
Professional
Engineering
Employees
Association
after
a
federal
mediator
intervened
,
according
to
the
union
.

A
spokesman
for
the
engineers
said
the
company
asked
the
union
to
reduce
its
demands
,
which
included
a
19
%
pay
hike
in
the
first
year
and
8
%
in
the
second
and
third
years
.

The
union
represents
about
28,000
engineers
and
technical
workers
.

Its
contract
expires
Dec.
1
.

Meanwhile
,
a
federal
mediator
is
scheduled
to
meet
today
with
Boeing
officials
and
representatives
of
55,000
striking
Machinists
.

``
It
will
take
several
meetings
to
resolve
this
,
''
said
a
spokesman
for
the
Machinists
union
.

``
We
do
n't
want
to
bring
back
something
the
members
will
reject
.

''
Machinists
already
have
rejected
a
package
that
would
have
provided
a
10
%
pay
raise
plus
bonuses
over
the
three-year
life
of
the
contract
.

It
also
would
have
reduced
mandatory
overtime
.

Investor
Asher
Edelman
increased
his
stake
in
Intelogic
Trace
Inc.
and
cleared
the
way
for
additional
purchases
.

It
was
n't
clear
,
however
,
whether
the
actions
were
related
to
a
battle
between
the
corporate
raider
and
New
York
attorney
Martin
Ackerman
for
control
of
Datapoint
Corp.
,
a
San
Antonio
,
Texas-based
data-processing
systems
maker
.

Intelogic
Trace
,
a
computer
services
company
,
was
spun
off
to
Datapoint
holders
in
1985
,
after
Mr.
Edelman
gained
control
.

After
Mr.
Ackerman
announced
he
was
soliciting
consents
from
shareholders
in
order
to
wrest
control
of
Datapoint
from
Mr.
Edelman
,
the
corporate
raider
purchased
30
%
of
Datapoint
's
shares
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
Mr.
Edelman
said
from
Sept.
29
to
Oct.
13
,
he
acquired
309,500
shares
of
Intelogic
common
shares

to

The
purchases
increased
his
stake
to
16.2
%
of
the
shares
outstanding
.

The
filing
also
said
certain
provisions
which
apply
to
persons
acquiring
20
%
or
more
of
Intelogic
common
stock
,
were
waived
by
Intelogic
for
Mr.

,
who
is
chairman
of

.

Mr.
Edelman
could
n't
be
reached
for
comment
.

The
federal
government
should
make
free
,
voluntary
testing
for
the
AIDS
virus
the
cornerstone
of
an
expanded
campaign
to
stop
the
spread
of
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
,
the
Hudson
Institute
recommended
.

``
By
encouraging
massive
,
routine
,
voluntary
testing
we
can
enable
society
to
voluntarily
segregate
itself
sexually
into
two
groups
:
those
who
carry
the
virus
and
those
who
do
not
,
''
the
Indianapolis
research
organization
said
in
a
new
report
.

The
report
takes
a
more
alarmed
view
of
AIDS
and
recommends
a
more
sweeping
response
than
many
other
analyses
.

It
warns
that
the
AIDS
epidemic
``
may
reduce
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
work
force
,
curb
productivity
gains
and
slow
economic
growth
.

''
It
contends
that
current
government
policy
is
failing
to
stem
the
AIDS
epidemic
because
it
suggests
the
use
of
condoms
can
make
sex
``
safe
.

''
But
the
report
says
:
``
The
only
safe
sex
is
sex
between
uninfected
partners
,
''
and
testing
is
the
only
way
to
learn
of
infection
.

Hudson
's
researchers
estimated
that
it
would
cost
less
than
$
650
million
a
year
to
test
the
entire
population
between
the
ages
of
12
and
65
years
old
.

In
addition
,
the
report
recommends
that
federal
and
state
governments
provide
free
treatment
to
all
who
test
positive
.

An
unexpectedly
sharp
widening
in
the
U.S.
trade
gap
for
August
dragged
the
dollar
lower
Tuesday
,
but
profit-taking
on
short
positions
helped
the
currency
rebound
to
close
mixed
against
major
counterparts
.

While
the
market
kept
careful
tabs
on
Wall
Street
's
gyrations
,
it
shrugged
off
a
modest
downturn
in
equities
to
bid
the
dollar
well
above
the
day
's
lows
.

Soon
after
the
release
of
the
U.S.
trade
figures
,
the
dollar
plunged
to
an
intraday
low
of
140.95
yen
.

It
also
declined
against
the
mark
but
did
n't
reach
its
intraday
low
of
1.8435
marks
until
two
hours
later
.

The
unit
stabilized
about
midday
New
York
time
at
around
1.85
marks
and
141
yen
,
prompting
unconfirmed
rumors
that
the
U.S.
Federal
Reserve
had
intervened
to
blunt
the
unit
's
tumble
.

The
dollar
finished
at
its
intraday
highs
.

Dealers
noted
that
the
foreign
exchange
market
's
initial
bearish
reaction
to
the
U.S.
trade
figures
was
tempered
later
by
a
``
calmer
reassessment
of
the
data
.

''
The
U.S.
Commerce
Department
reported
a
$
10.77
billion
deficit
in
August
,
compared
with
a
revised
July
deficit
of
$
8.24
billion
.

Economists
had
expected
a
$
9.1
billion
gap
.

The
August
figure
reflected
a
6.4
%
rise
in
imports
and
a
0.2
%
drop
in
exports
.

Marc
M.
Goloven
,
an
economist
with
Manufacturers
Hanover
Trust
in
New
York
,
said
that
while
the
figures
appear
to
indicate
a
sadly
deteriorating
U.S.
trade
performance
,
there
's
still
enough
positive
news
in
the
data
to
justify
buying
dollars
.

He
said
that
while
the
U.S.
trade
gap
with
Canada
has
widened
significantly
,
the
trade
deficit
with
Western
Europe
and
Japan
continues
to
narrow
.

And
he
added
that
manufactured
goods
exports
are
still
rising
.

The
dollar
's
near-term
path
remains
foggy
,
according
to
currencny
analysts
,
who
characterize
the
market
as
``
bewildering
.

''
In
late
New
York
trading
yesterday
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8667
marks
,
down
from
1.8685
marks
late
Monday
,
and
at
142.75
yen
,
up
from
141.85
yen
late
Monday
.

Sterling
was
unchanged
at
$
1.5753
.

In
Tokyo
Wednesday
,
the
U.S.
currency
opened
for
trading
at
142.55
yen
,
unchanged
from
Tuesday
's
Tokyo
close
.

Later
,
the
U.S.
currency
fell
to
about
142.25
yen
on
news
reports
of
the
San
Francisco
earthquake
.

Some
analysts
remain
bullish
and
point
out
that
the
dollar
continues
to
be
well
bid
despite
key
rate
increases
in
Europe
and
Japan
,
several
weeks
of
aggressive
dollar
sales
by
the
world
central
banks
--
some
traders
estimate
that
the
barrage
of
sales
topped
$
12
billion
--
and
a
190-point
plunge
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

They
note
that
the
U.S.
unit
is
trading
at
the
upper
end
of
the
presumed
target
zones
established
by
the
Group
of
Seven
trading
partners
.

The
G-7
comprises
West
Germany
,
the
U.S.
,
France
,
the
U.K.
,
Italy
,
Canada
and
Japan
.

The
so-called
Louvre
accord
was
seen
to
have
set
ranges
of
1.70
marks
to
1.90
marks
and
120
yen
to
140
yen
.

They
say
that
the
recent
injection
of
liquidity
into
the
U.S.
banking
system
has
been
modest
,
and
they
do
n't
anticipate
significant
easing
by
the
U.S.
Federal
Reserve
.

The
Fed
arranged
$
1.5
billion
of
customer
repurchase
agreements
Tuesday
,
the
second
repurchase
agreement
in
two
days
.

The
move
,
which
injects
capital
into
the
system
,
is
seen
as
an
effort
to
reassure
the
finanicial
markets
that
the
U.S.
central
bank
is
ready
to
provide
the
ample
liquidity
.

But
other
analysts
contend
that
while
the
Fed
's
move
to
loosen
credit
has
n't
been
aggressive
,
it
nevertheless
sends
a
clear
signal
that
,
at
least
for
now
,
the
Fed
has
relaxed
its
grip
on
credit
.

They
add
that
the
Fed
has
allowed
the
key
federal
funds
interest
rate
to
dip
to
about
8
%
from
its
levels
of
just
below
9
%
last
week
.

The
federal
funds
rate
is
the
overnight
lending
rate
that
banks
charge
each
other
.

Market
participants
said
that
the
mark
continues

post
the
most
significant

On

National
Semiconductor
Corp.
said
it
settled
a
four-year-old
patent
infringement
case
against
Linear
Technology
Corp.
by
accepting
a
$
3
million
payment
from
Linear
in
exchange
for
granting
Linear
irrevocable
licenses
for
all
products
involved
.

The
two
companies
also
agreed
to
settle
any
future
property
rights
issues
over
the
next
10
years
through
binding
arbitration
,
both
companies
said
.

The
products
are
so-called
analog
integrated
circuits
that
have
applications
in
the
consumer
electronics
,
automobile
and
electronic
instrumentation
markets
.

Linear
Technology
,
Milpitas
,
Calif.
,
called
the
settlement
``
positive
,
''
since
products
covered
by
the
disputed
patents
account
for
about
20
%
of
its
annual
sales
.

The
electronics
concern
said
it
already
has
paid
$
2
million
of
the
settlement
to
National
Semiconductor
,
Santa
Clara
,
Calif.
,
and
will
pay
the
remaining
$
1
million
in
equal
installments
over
the
next
eight
quarters
.

The
payments
are
n't
expected
to
have
an
impact
on
coming
operating
results

The

Procter

expanding
its

said
it
acquired
Maryland

Foods
,
a
coffee
supplier
,
from
an
investor
group
led
by
F.
Philip
Handy
of
Winter

Houston-based
Maryland
Club
Foods
,
which
had
sales
of
about
$
200
million
last
year
,
sells
coffee
under
the
Maryland
Club
and
Butter-Nut
brands
to
restaurants
,
hotels
,
offices
and
airlines
.

The
acquisition
``
gives
us
additional
production
capacity
for
the
food
service
coffee
business
and
a
stronger
distribution
network
,
''
a
P&G
spokesman
said
.

P&G
already
sells
its
Folgers
ground
roast
coffee
to
food
service
concerns
,
but
not
to
as
many
markets
as
Maryland
Club
.

For
example
,
P&G
up
until
now
has
n't
sold
coffee
to
airlines
and
does
only
limited
business
with
hotels
and
large
restaurant
chains
.

Maryland
Club
also
distributes
tea
,
which
fits
well
with
P&G
's
Tender
Leaf
brand
,
and
hot
cocoa
products
.

The
company
said
the
acquisition
has
been
completed
and
reviewed
by

The
purchase
includes

plant
in

said
the

will
be
used

President
Bush
will
veto
a
bill
funding
the
Departments
of
Labor
,
Education
and
Health
and
Human
Services
because
it
would
allow
federal
funding
of
abortions
for
victims
of
rape
and
incest
,
the
White
House
said
.

Mr.
Bush
had
threatened
a
veto
previously
.

But
he
put
off
a
firm
decision
while
his
aides
and
legislators
searched
for
a
compromise
that
would
tighten
requirements
for
such
abortions
in
a
way
acceptable
to
the
president
.

White
House
Press
Secretary
Marlin
Fitzwater
said
negotiations
between
Bush
aides
and
lawmakers
ended
Monday
without
success
.

Most
lawmakers
think
it
will
be
extremely
difficult
for
Mr.
Bush
's
opponents
on
the
abortion
issue
to
round
up
the
votes
needed
to
override
the
veto
.

But
there
still
may
be
prolonged
debate
and
political
maneuvering
that
holds
up
the
$
156.7
billion
funding
bill
for
the
fiscal
year
that
began
Oct.
1
.

Mr.
Bush
has
said
he
personally
approves
of
abortions
in
the
cases
of
rape
,
incest
and
danger
to
the
life
of
the
mother
.

But
he
has
opposed
Medicaid
funding
of
abortions
for
poor
women
who
say
they
are
victims
of
rape
and
incest
,
arguing
that
those
exceptions
are
enforced
so
loosely
that
they
open
the
way
for
abortions
for
other
women
.

,
will
help
the
statutory
managers
of
DFC
New

Ltd.
to
evaluate
the
failed
investment
bank
's
condition
.

Earlier
this
month
,
the
Reserve
Bank
of
New
Zealand
,
the
country
's
central
bank
,
appointed
the
managers
to
run
the
investment
bank
and
pay
creditors
.

DFC
asked
the
central
bank
to
appoint
managers
after
it
revised
loan-loss
provisions
to
around
the
same
level
of
shareholders
'
funds
of
180
million
New

dollars
(
US$
105.4
million
)
.

DFC
is
held
80
%
by

,
New

,
and
20
%
by

.

A

confirmed
its

declined
to
elaborate
.

The
managers
said
in
a
brief
statement
yesterday
that
Morgan
will
help
evaluate
DFC
's
position
and
help
determine
alternatives
.

The
managers
do
n't
expect
to
complete
the
evaluation
until
Nov.

An
experimental
vaccine
can
alter
the
immune
response
of
people
infected
with
the
AIDS
virus
,
a
prominent
U.S.
scientist
said
.

However
,
that
does
n't
mean
they
can
benefit
from
the
vaccine
.

Its
effectiveness
ca
n't
be
determined
until
a
large
clinical
trial
is
undertaken
by
the
Army
in
January
,
according
to
Robert
Redfield
,
chief
of
acquired
immune
deficiency
syndrome
research
at
Walter
Reed
Army
Institute
of
Research
.

Dr.
Redfield
's
report
on
early
experiments
using
an
AIDS
vaccine
made
by
MicroGeneSys
Inc.
of
West
Haven
,
Conn.
,
came
at
a
meeting
of
AIDS
vaccine
researchers
in
Florida
late
Monday
.

The
vaccine
,
VaxSyn
HIV-1
,
has
been
safely
given
to
14
people
,
some
of
whom
are
experiencing
substantial
increases
in
certain
antibodies
.

``
The
conventional
wisdom
used
to
be
that
you
could
n't
modify
the
immune
response
of
an
infected
individual
''
by
innoculating
them
with
synthetic
viral
proteins
,
Dr.
Redfield
said
.

``
We
've
demonstrated
that
you
can
.

''
He
said
certain
volunteers
developed
kinds
of
antibodies
associated
with
early
AIDS
.

Other
antibodies
sparked
by
the
preparation
are
of
a
sort
rarely
present
in
large
quantities
in
infected
or
ill
individuals
,
he
added
.

One
of
the
mysteries
of
AIDS
remains
why
infected
people
produce
large
quantities
of
antibodies
,
but
deteriorate
nonetheless
.

Matra
S.A.
reported
its
1989
first-half
profit
soared
88
%
,
and
indicated
that
its
previous
estimate
of
a
50
%
rise
in
earnings
for
all
of
1989
will
be
exceeded
by
a
wide
margin
.

The
French
electronics
and
defense
group
said
attributable
consolidated
net
profit
for
the
first
six
months
of
1989
totaled
244
million
francs
(
$
38.4
million
)
,
compared
with
130
million
francs
(
$
20.5
million
)
in
the
corresponding
period
of
Operating
profit
climbed
51
%
,
to
572
million
francs
from
378
million
in
the
first
half
of
1988
.

Matra
said
the
sharp
improvement
in
net
profit
partly
reflected
a
decline
of
59
million
francs
in
the
group
's
net
loss
from
nonrecurring
items
in
the
first
half
of
this
year
to
104
million
francs
from
163
million
a
year
earlier
.

There
was
also
a
decline
in
the
group
's
net
financial
costs
to
25
million
francs
from
50
million
a
year
before
.

These
movements
were
offset
,
however
,
by
a
steep
rise
in
corporate
income
tax
payments
to
199
million
francs
from
35
million
in
the
first
six
months
of
1988
.

Matra
said
the
sharp
rise
in
its
first-half
earnings
was
based
on
a
15
%
gain
in
consolidated
revenue
to
10.16
billion
francs
from
8.85
billion
a
year
earlier
.

Rep.
Lee
Hamilton
(

)
said
he
and
Rep.
Byron
Dorgan
(

)
are
backing
away
from
their
proposal
to
make
the
Treasury
Secretary
a
voting
member
of
the
Federal
Reserve
panel
that
sets
monetary
policy
.

Rep.
Hamilton
said
the
bill
will
be
modified
substantially
to
call
for
two
meetings
each
year
between
the
Fed
's
open
market
committee
and
the
Treasury
Secretary
,
the
chairman
of
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
and
the
director
of
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
.

The
original
bill
was
strongly
opposed
by
the
Fed
and
publicly
criticized
by
friends
of
the
Fed
as
an
attempt
to
undermine
the
central
bank
's
independence
.

Fed
critics
,
however
,
hailed
it
as
a
long
overdue
attempt
to
bring
a
measure
of
openness
and
democracy
to
the
setting
of
monetary
policy
.

Rep.
Hamilton
said
the
purpose
of
the
meetings
would
be
to
``
improve
communications
and
perhaps
coordination
between
the
executive
branch
and
the
Fed
.

B.F.
Goodrich
Co.
said
third-quarter
profits
dropped
34
%
because
of
lower
prices
for
polyvinyl
chloride
materials
,
the
company
's
largest
product

Polyvinyl

.

Prices
for
general-purpose
PVC
resin
have
dropped
more
than

The
plastic
resin
is
used
in
a
wide
range
of
products
,
including
siding
,
pipe
and
electrical
wire
insulation

Goodrich

conducting

talks
with
West

's
Daimler-Benz
AG
on
a
series
of
projects
in
the
aerospace
sector
,
Fiat
officials
said
.

However
,
the
officials
said
it
was
too
early
to
disclose
the
nature
of
the
proposed
projects
or
indicate
when
the
talks
might
be
concluded
.

Daimler-Benz
Chairman
Edzard

told

daily
Il

that
talks
are
taking
place
between
both

``

us
very
much

there
currently
are

,
''
a
Fiat
spokeswoman
said
.

In
the
interview
,
Mr.
Reuter
said
he
is
thinking
foremost
of
cooperation
in
the
truck
sector
,
but
``
in
the
long
run
,
I
do
n't
want
to
rule
out

.

''
Roberto
Morelli
,
Italy
analyst
for
County

London
,
said
that
right
now
``
the
market
is
n't
being
influenced
by
that
kind
of
news
,
''
referring
to
the
conditional
nature
of
the
talks
mentioned
by
Mr.
Reuter
and
by
the
uncertainty
surrounding
world
stock
exchanges
this
week
.

Paul
Tanner
was
named
president
,
chief
executive
officer
and
chairman
of
this
oil
and
natural
gas
company
.

He
succeeds
John
A.
Boudreau
,
who
resigned
for
personal
reasons
.

Mr.
Tanner
had
been
president
of
Penn
Pacific
's
National
Southwest
Capital
Group
subsidiary
.

Mr.
Boudreau
will
remain
with
Penn
Pacific
as
a
director
and
a
member
of
the
executive

.

He
has
also
agreed
to
become

the

said

Spooked
investors
,
despite
their
stampede
to
dump
takeover
stocks
,
should
hold
on
tight
to
their
Jaguar
shares
.

That
's
the
view
of
some
analysts
here
who
argue
that
Britain
's
leading
maker
of
luxury
cars
still
may
have
two
U.S.
auto
giants
battling
for
it
.

Yesterday
,
Ford
Motor
disclosed
that
it
has
raised
its
holding
in
Jaguar
to
10.4
%
from
5
%
.

Both
Ford
and
its
rival
General
Motors
recently
set
their
sights
on
grabbing
significant
minority
stakes
in
the
British
company
.

Ford
's
latest
move
increases
the
pressure
on
GM
to
complete
its
current
talks
with
Jaguar
quickly
.

GM
is
likely
to
reach
the
cooperative
operating
pact
it
has
been
seeking
in
about
two
weeks
,
knowledgeable
individuals
say
.

At
that
point
investors
may
face
a
long
,
bumpy
ride
.

A
victor
in
the
fight
for
Jaguar
may
not
emerge
until
after
the
expiration
late
next
year
of
British
government
takeover
restrictions
.

The
curbs
prevent
a
buyer
from
purchasing
more
than
15
%
of
Jaguar
shares
without
permission
.

``
This
is
an
exceptionally
odd
takeover
battle
,
''
says
London
analyst
Christopher
Will
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
.

Jaguar
's
American
depositary
receipts
were
up
yesterday
in
a
down
market
,
closing
at
10
.

(
Jaguar
's
ADRs
make
the
company
one
of
the
most
widely
held
United
Kingdom
stocks
in
the
U.S.
,
with
more
than
one-fourth
of
its
shares
owned
there
.

)
Jaguar
topped
the
most-active
list
for
the
U.S.
over-the-counter
market
Monday
.

And
on
London
's
Stock
Exchange
Monday
,
18.5
million
shares
were
traded
,
far
above
the
usual
volume
.

Ford
's
share
purchases
undoubtedly
accounted
for
much
of
Monday
's
heavy
trading
.

Last
week
,
many
Jaguar
shareholders
took
their
money
and
ran
.

Fears
that
Ford
's
ardor
might
be
cooling
put
Jaguar
shares
into
reverse
after
GM
confirmed
its
friendly
negotiations
with
Jaguar
.

But
yesterday
's
announcement
indicates
that
Ford
has
n't
lost
interest
.

Both
Shearson
's
Mr
.

Will
and
Stephen
Reitman
,
European
auto
analyst
at
the
London
brokerage
firm
UBS-Phillips
&
Drew
,
recently
switched
their
Jaguar
recommendations
to
hold
from
buy
.

``
Sit
tight
''
through
the
coming
volatility
,
Mr.
Reitman
suggests
,
though
he
concedes
that
many
small
investors
will
find
Jaguar
's
zigzags
``
too
hard
to
swallow
.

''
But
a
crucial
point
is
how
Ford
reacts
when
GM
,
the
world
's
largest
auto
maker
,
firms
up
its
proposed
deal
with
Jaguar
.

At
the
moment
,
Ford
executives
will
say
little
beyond
reiterating
their
desire
to
raise
Ford
's
Jaguar
stake
to
about
15
%
.

GM
is
expected
to
inject
roughly
#
200
million
(
$
316
million
)
by
acquiring
some
Jaguar
shares
,
and
then
win
Jaguar
management
's
promise
of
an
eventual
30
%
stake
.

Analysts
believe
the
car
makers
also
will
create
joint
ventures
to
develop
new
executive
models
,
doubling
Jaguar
's
yearly
output
of
50,000
cars
.

Jaguar
shareholders
would
have
to
bless
such
a
far-reaching
accord
.

Ford
might
challenge
the
proposal
by
offering
a
full
bid
if
holders
and
the
U.K.
government
agreed
to
drop
the
anti-takeover
barrier
early
.

``
I
think
Ford
is
going
to
come
out
with
full
guns
blazing
,
''
Mr.
Reitman
says
.

``
Ford
wants
{
Jaguar
}
very
much
.

''
U.S.
takeover-stock
speculators
,
who
may
own
between
20
%
and
30
%
of
Jaguar
,
could
give
Ford
enough
votes
to
block
the
GM
deal
.

GM
might
counterbid
.

Then
,
Mr
.

Will
says
,
``
you
get
a
bidding
war
between
two
very
rich
,
very
determined
international
companies
.

''
He
believes
Jaguar
's
share
price
could
zoom
to
between
#
8
and
#
10
(
$
12.60
to
$
15.80
)
.

``
There
's
quite
a
bit
of
value
left
in
the
{
Jaguar
}
shares
here
even
though
they
have
run
up
''
lately
,
says
Doug
Johnson
,
a
fund
manager
for
Seattle-based
Safeco
Asset
Management
.

At
the
moment
,
he
intends
to
keep
the
firm
's
180,000
Jaguar
shares
.

The
risk
is
that
Jaguar
's
share
price
could
slump
if
GM
's
agreement
with
Jaguar
effectively
locks
out
its
U.S.
rival
.

``
Ford
's
appetite
to
attack
{
Jaguar
}
could
gradually
wane
over
time
,
particularly
if
Saab
is
a
reasonably
attractive
proposition
,
''
says
John
Lawson
,
an
auto
analyst
at
London
's
Nomura
Research
Institute
.

He
thinks
Saab-Scania
AB
on
Friday
will
announce
the
sale
of
50
%
of
its
car
division
to
Ford
;
the
companies
have
been
discussing
closer
cooperation
for
months
.

Clifford
Stahl
,
president
and
chief
investment
officer
of
C-S
Capital
Advisors
Inc.
,
two
weeks
ago
sold
his
Cincinnati
firm
's
107,100
Jaguar
ADRs
at
about
10
each
,
making
a
tidy
profit
on
a
holding
purchased
at
4
in
early
May
.

``
I
thought
the
probabilities
of
{
a
bidding
war
}
happening
were
less
,
''
he
says
.

Of
course
,
that
was
before
Ford
's
latest
move
.

Newport

of
Santa
Ana
,
Calif.
,
said
Milton
B.
Hollander
,
who
holds
a
49.4
%
stake
,
requested
a
special
shareholders
'
meeting
next
Wednesday
to
remove
four
current
directors
and
elect
an
alternative
slate
.

Mr.
Hollander
's
High
Technology
Holding
Co.
of
Stamford
,

,
acquired
most
of
its
stake
last
August
in
an
$
11-a-share
tender
offer
for
Newport
,
a
maker
of
electronic-measuring
devices
.

Newport
said
Mr.
Hollander
is
asking
shareholders
to
retain
only

director
,
James
R.
Lees
,
a
Newport

.

The
board
is

proposing

and
the

date
,
Newport
said
.

Mr.
Hollander
``

Sandoz
AG
,
a
major
Swiss
chemical
and
pharmaceutical
group
,
said
that
its
group
sales
rose
25
%
to
9.482
billion
francs
(
$
5.80
billion
)
in
the
first
nine
months
of
this
year
,
with
strong
gains
in
all
divisions
.

A
year
earlier
sales
totaled
7.567
billion
francs
.

Positive
currency
rates
and
strong
sales
growth
led
to
a
substantial
rise
in
consolidated
profit
in
the
period
,
although
the
company
did
n't
provide
figures
,
as
is
customary
with
Swiss
companies
.

Sandoz
said
it
expects
a
``
substantial
increase
''
in
consolidated
profit
for
the
full
year
,
barring
major
currency
rate
changes
.

Amstrad
PLC
,
a
British
maker
of
computer
hardware
and
communications
equipment
,
posted
a
52
%
plunge
in
pretax
profit
for
the
latest
year
.

The
#
76.6
million
(
$
120.6
million
)
in
pretax
profit
for
the
12
months
to
June
30
was
down
from
#
160
million
(
$
252
million
)
a
year
earlier
and
below
market
expectations
of
#
80
million
and
#
90
million
.

The
slump
in
profit
,
which
came
despite
steady
sales
,
was
attributed
to
increased
costs
for
parts
and
problems
with
model
introductions
.

Amstrad
's
profit
after
taxes
fell
a
similarly
steep
51
%
,
to

51.1

from

its
competitors
and
customers
in
the
personal-computer
industry
,
as
it
reported
a
36
%
jump
in
fiscal
first-quarter
earnings
on
a
33
%
revenue
gain
.

The
Redmond
,
Wash.
company
,
a
bellwether
provider
of
operating
systems
and
software
for
personal-computer
makers
and
users
,
reported
net
income
for
the
quarter
ended
Sept.
30
of
$
49.6
million
,
or
87
cents
a
share
,
up
from
$
36.6
million
,
or
65
cents
a
share
,
in
the
year-ago
period
.

Revenue
rose
to
$
235.2
million
,
from
$
176.4
million
.

Microsoft
previously
indicated
it
would
have
a
strong
quarter
by
forecasting
its
revenue
gain
on
Oct.
4
,
causing
a
$
6.50
a
share
jump
in
its
stock
.

But
its
stock
jumped
again
yesterday
as
it
disclosed
surprisingly
strong
margins
on
those
sales
.

Microsoft
's
stock
rose
$
2.875
a
share
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
to
$
78.625
.

The
stock
had
hit
a
high
of
$
81
a
share
early
last
week
but
collapsed
to
$
73.50
in
the
Friday
stock
plunge
.

The
company
had
been
experiencing
softening
margins
because
of
increased
sales
of
software
applications
,
which
have
lower
margins
than
do
operating
systems
.

But
the
company
said
that
trend
was
offset
in
the
first
quarter
by
better
economies
of
scale
and
efficiencies
in
manufacturing
.

As
a
result
,
Microsoft
's
cost
of
goods
,
as
a
percentage
of
sales
,
fell
17
%
from
the
year-ago
quarter
and
13
%
from
the
previous
period
.

The
trend
drove
up
the
aftertax
margin
--
net
income
as
a
percentage
of
revenues
--
to
21.1
%
in
the
quarter
,
compared
with
20.7
%
a
year
earlier
.

Microsoft
officials
said
the
strong
results
also
reflected
continuing
high
demand
for
its
software
applications
and
operating
systems
.

While
it
has
predicted
that
overall
growth
in
unit
sales
of
personal
computers
is
slowing
to
about
a
10
%
yearly
rate
,
its
own
products
are
selling
at
a
much
faster
rate
because
many
are
geared
to
the
high-performance
end
of
the
market
.

That
segment
continues
to
post
strong
quarter-to-quarter
gains
,
while
the
low-end
,
or
commodity
segment
,
of
the
industry
is
experiencing
sluggish
growth
or
even
sales
declines
.

Compared
with
its
previous
quarter
,
the
final
period
of
its
1989
fiscal
year
,
net
rose
9
%
,
and
sales
rose
7
%
.

Control
Data
Corp.
,
Minneapolis
,
signed
a
joint
development
agreement
with
MIPS
Computer
Systems
Inc.
to
incorporate
an
emerging
computing
architecture
in
future
machines
.

MIPS
is
a
leader
in
what
is
known
as
reduced-instruction
set
computing
,
or
RISC
,
a
technology
combining
microprocessors
and
sophisticated
software
.

In
joining
MIPS
,
Control
Data
follows
several
competitors
in
embracing
RISC
as
a
new
design
approach
.

Digital
Equipment
Corp.
,
Tandem
Computers
Inc.
,
NEC
Corp.
and
Group
Bull
,
among
others
,
have
similar
arrangements
with
MIPs
,
based
in
Sunnyvale
,
Calif
.

Control
Data
said
it
expects
its
first
RISC-based
mainframe
machine
to
be
introduced
next
year
.

The
accord
with
MIPS
calls
for
Control
Data
to
share
its
expertise
in
data
storage
,
the
companies
said
.

Control
Data
also
said
it
is
developing
what
it
called
a
``
supermainframe
''
computer
,
the
Cyber

,
intended
for
scientists
,
engineers
and

Paul

a

Mr.

BroadBeach
Associates
Inc.
,
the
Los
Angeles
investment
partnership
whose
$
62-a-share
bid
for
McGill
Manufacturing
Co.
was
topped
recently
by
a
competing
offer
from
a
Swedish
concern
,
disclosed
that
it
sold
its
entire
7
%
McGill
stake
.

McGill
,
a
Valparaiso
,
Ind.
,
ball-bearing
manufacturer
,
had
rebuffed
BroadBeach
's
proposal
.

It
has
since
asked
holders
not
to
immediately
tender
their
shares
under
a
recent
$
72-a-share
,
or
$
104
million
,
bid
from
AB
SKF
of
Sweden
,
until
McGill
directors
have
completed
their
evaluation
.

In
a
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
filing
,
BroadBeach
said
it
sold
the
101,000
McGill
shares
for
$
7.3
million
in
a
private
transaction
on
Oct.
12
.

BroadBeach
did
n't
identify
the
buyer
of
the
shares
,
but
the
date
of
the
selloff
followed
by
one
day
the
Swedish

offer
,
and
the
indicated

A
BroadBeach

Luis
Nogales
,
45
years

,
has
been
elected
to
the
board
of
this
brewer

Mr.
Nogales

former
president
of

and
the
Univision
Spanish-language
network
,
most
recently
co-founded
Nogales
Castro
Partners
,
a
California-based
media
acquisition
firm
.

Mr.
Nogales
,
the
first
Hispanic

to
serve
as
a
Coors

,
is
an
addition
to
the

,
increasing

Hachette
S.A.
,
a
European
media
and
publishing
group
,
reported
a
small
rise
in
its
attributable
first-half
group
profit
,
excluding
exceptional
items
,
to
133.8
million
francs
(
$
21.1
million
)
from
130.1
million
francs
a
year
earlier
.

The
Paris-based
group
said
its
earlier
projection
--
that
group
profit
for
all
of
1989
would
be
close
to
the
322.7
million
francs
posted
for
1988
--
remains
valid
.

Taking
into
account
nonrecurring
gains
and
losses
,
Hachette
's
group
net
income
for
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
totaled
246.6
million
francs
,
practically
double
the
year-earlier
figure
of
124.5
million
francs
.

Analysts
said
Hachette
's
earnings
in
the
second
half
might
be
boosted
by
a
capital
gain
from
the
sale
of
the
Paris
headquarters
of
a
newspaper-delivery
company
that
is
49
%
owned
by
Hachette

Oncor
Inc.
,
Gaithersburg
,
Md.
,
said
it
received
approval
from
the
U.S.
Food
and
Drug
Administration
to
market
a
genetic
test
that
will
assist
in
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
leukemia
and
lymph
cancer
.

The
gene
rearrangement
test
is
more
accurate
than
existing
tests
for
diagnosing
the
type
of
cancer
,
whether
it
has
spread
or
whether
there
is
a
recurrence
following
treatment
,
said
Oncor
President
Stephen
Turner
.

Mr.
Turner
said
the
test
initially
will
be
used
in
conjunction
with
biopsies
and
other
tests
,
but
eventually
might
become
the
benchmark
for
tumor
analysis
.

Mr.
Turner
said
the
test
will
be
shipped
in
45
days
to
hospitals
and
clinical
laboratories
.

Dr.
Wyndham
Wilson
,
a
cancer
treatment
specialist
at
the
National
Cancer
Institute
,
said
the
test
is
widely
used
in
research
centers
but
is
n't
having
a
major
impact
because
it
is
only
occasionally
useful
in
choosing
the
most
effective
treatment
.

But
the
test
may
prove
to
be
more
sensitive
in
determining
whether
a
tumor
has
spread
or
returned
following
treatment
,
Dr.
Wilson
said
.

``
We
do
n't
know
yet
how
useful
it
's
going
to
be
,
''
he
said
.

Oncor
,
a
six-year-old
developer
of
genetic
medical
tests
,
projects
that
the
cancer
test
will
help
it
to
post
its
first-ever
profit
during
the
first
quarter
of
1990
,
Mr.
Turner
said
.

The
company
will
charge
$
35
for
a
test
and
projects
about
$
2
million
in
revenue
from
the
test
during
the
first
12
months
of
marketing
,
he
said

Unilab
Corp.
,
Norcross
,
Ga.
,
said
it
acquired
the
clinical
laboratories
of
closely
held
Central
Diagnostic
Laboratory
Inc.
in
a
cash
and
securities
transaction
valued
at
$
85
million
.

Unilab
said
its
wholly
owned
MetWest
Inc.
unit
paid
$
25
million
in
cash
,
provided
$
30
million
in
notes
and
$
30
million
in
preferred
stock
to
acquire
Central
's
labs
in
the
Western
U.S
.

Unilab
,
which
provides
clinical
laboratory
services
,
competed
with
Central
,
based
in
Tarzana
,
Calif.
,
in
a
number
of
areas
.

Beyond
removing
a
competitor
,
the
combination
should
provide
``
synergies
,
''
said
Fred
Harlow
,
Unilab
's
chief
financial
officer
.

It
also
will
hand
Unilab
new
markets
.

In
Los
Angeles
,
for
example
,
Central
has
had
a
strong
market
position
while
Unilab
's
presence
has
been
less
prominent

to
Mr.
Harlow

are
racing
to
exploit
the
possibilities
.

Eventually
viewers
may
grow
bored
with
the

and
resent
the

.

But
right
now
programmers
are
figuring
that

who
are
busy
dialing
up

range
of
services
may
put
down

One
of

leaders
behind
the
expanded
use

numbers
is
Call
Interactive
,
a
joint
venture
of
giants
American
Express
Co.
and
American
Telephone

.

Formed
in
August

the
venture
weds
AT&T

newly
expanded
900
service
with
200
voice-activated
computers
in
American
Express
's
Omaha
,
Neb.
,
service
center
.

Other
long-distance
carriers
have
also
begun
marketing
enhanced
900
service
,
and
special
consultants
are
springing
up
to
exploit
the
new
tool
.

Blair
Entertainment
,
a
New
York
firm
that
advises
TV
stations
and
sells
ads
for
them
,
has
just
formed
a
subsidiary
--
900
Blair
--
to
apply
the
technology
to
television
.

The
use
of
900
toll
numbers
has
been
expanding
rapidly
in
recent
years
.

For
a
while
,
high-cost
pornography
lines
and
services
that
tempt
children
to
dial
(
and
redial
)
movie
or
music
information
earned
the
service
a
somewhat
sleazy
image
,
but
new
legal
restrictions
are
aimed
at
trimming
excesses
.

The
cost
of
a
900
call
is
set
by
the
originator
--
ABC
Sports
,
for
example
--
with
the
cheapest
starting
at
75
cents
.

Billing
is
included
in
a
caller
's
regular
phone
bill
.

From
the
fee
,
the
local
phone
company
and
the
long-distance
carrier
extract
their
costs
to
carry
the
call
,
passing
the
rest
of
the
money
to
the
originator
,
which
must
cover
advertising
and
other
costs
.

In
recent
months
,
the
technology
has
become
more
flexible
and
able
to
handle
much
more
volume
.

Before
,
callers
of
900
numbers
would
just
listen
and
not
talk
,
or
they
'd
vote
``
yes
''
or
``
no
''
by
calling
one
of
two
numbers
.

(
People
in
the
phone
business
call
this
technology
``
900
click
.

''
)
Now
,
callers
are
led
through
complex
menus
of
choices
to
retrieve
information
they
want
,
and
the
hardware
can
process
10,000
calls
in
90
seconds
.

Up
to
now
,
900
numbers
have
mainly
been
used
on
local
TV
stations
and
cable
channels
.

MTV
used
one
to
give
away
the
house
that
rock
star
Jon
Bon
Jovi
grew
up
in
.

For
several
years
,
Turner
Broadcasting
System
's
Cable
News
Network
has
invited
viewers
to
respond
nightly
to
topical
issues
(
``
Should
the
U.S.
military
intervene
in
Panama
?
''
)
,
but
even
the
hottest
controversies
on
CNN
log
only
about
10,000
calls
.

The
newest
uses
of
the
900-interactive
technology
demonstrate
the
growing
variety
of
applications
.

Capital
Inc.
,
CBS
Inc.
and
General
Electric
Co.
's
National
Broadcasting
Co.
unit
are
expected
to
announce
soon
a
joint
campaign
to
raise
awareness
about
hunger
.

The
subject
will
be
written
into
the
plots
of
prime-time
shows
,
and
viewers
will
be
given
a
900
number
to
call
.

Callers
will
be
sent
educational
booklets
,
and
the
call
's
modest
cost
will
be
an
immediate
method
of
raising
money
.

Other
network
applications
have
very
different
goals
.

ABC
Sports
was
looking
for
ways
to
lift
deflated
halftime
ratings
for
``
Monday
Night
Football
.

''
Kurt
Sanger
,
ABC
Sports
's
marketing
director
,
says
that
now
``
tens
of
thousands
''
of
fans
call
its
900
number
each
week
to
vote
for
the
best
punt
return
,
quarterback
sack
,
etc
.

Profit
from
the
calls
goes
to
charity
,
but
ABC
Sports
also
uses
the
calls
as
a
sales
tool
:
After
thanking
callers
for
voting
,
Frank
Gifford
offers
a
football
videotape
for
$
19.95
,
and
5
%
of
callers
stay
on
the
line
to
order
it
.

Jackets
may
be
sold
next
.

Meanwhile
,
NBC
Sports
recently
began
``
Scores
Plus
,
''
a
year-round
,
24-hour
900
line
providing
a
complex
array
of
scores
,
analysis
and
fan
news
.

A
spokesman
said
its
purpose
is
``
to
bolster
the
impression
that
NBC
Sports
is
always
there
for
people
.

''
NBC
's
``
On-Line
''
consumer
minutes
have
increased
advertiser
spending
during
the
day
,
the
network
's
weakest
period
.

Each
weekday
matches
a
sponsor
and
a
topic
:
On
Mondays
,
Unilever
N.V.
's
Lever
Bros.
sponsors
tips
on
diet
and
exercise
,
followed
by
a
30-second
Lever
Bros.
commercial
.

Viewers
can
call
a
900
number
for
additional
advice
,
which
will
be
tailored
to
their
needs
based
on
the
numbers
they
punch
(
``
Press
one
if
you
're
pregnant
,
''
etc
.

)
.

If
the
caller
stays
on
the
line
and
leaves
a
name
and
address
for
the
sponsor
,
coupons
and
a
newsletter
will
be
mailed
,
and
the
sponsor
will
be
able
to
gather
a
list
of
desirable
potential
customers
.

Diane
Seaman
,
an
NBC-TV
vice
president
,
says
NBC
has
been
able
to
charge
premium
rates
for
this
ad
time
.

She
would
n't
say
what
the
premium
is
,
but
it
's
believed
to
be
about
40
%
above
regular
daytime
rates
.

``
We
were
able
to
get
advertisers
to
use
their
promotion
budget
for
this
,
because
they
get
a
chance
to
do
couponing
,
''
says
Ms.
Seaman
.

``
And
we
were
able
to
attract
some
new
advertisers
because
this
is
something
new
.

''
Mr.
Parks
of
Call
Interactive
says
TV
executives
are
considering
the
use
of
900
numbers
for
``
talk
shows
,
game
shows
,
news
and
opinion
surveys
.

''
Experts
are
predicting
a
big
influx
of
new
shows
in
1990
,
when
a
service
called
``
automatic
number
information
''
will
become
widely
available
.

This
service
identifies
each
caller
's
phone
number
,
and
it
can
be
used
to
generate
instant
mailing
lists
.

``
Hard
Copy
,
''
the
new
syndicated
tabloid
show
from
Paramount
Pictures
,
will
use
its
900
number
for
additional
purposes
that
include
research
,
says
executive
producer
Mark
B.
von
S.
Monsky
.

``
For
a
piece
on
local
heroes
of
World
War
II
,
we
can
ask
people
to
leave
the
name
and
number
of
anyone
they
know
who
won
a
medal
,
''
he
says
.

``
That
'll
save
us
time
and
get
people
involved
.

''
But
Mr.
Monsky
sees
much
bigger
changes
ahead
.

``
These
are
just
baby
steps
toward
real
interactive
video
,
which
I
believe
will
be
the
biggest
thing
yet
to
affect
television
,
''
he
says
.

Although
it
would
be
costly
to
shoot
multiple
versions
,
TV
programmers
could
let
audiences
vote
on
different
endings
for
a
movie
.

Fox
Broadcasting
experimented
with
this
concept
last
year
when
viewers
of
``
Married
...
With
Children
''
voted
on
whether
Al
should
say
``
I
love
you
''
to
Peg
on
Valentine
's
Day
.

Someday
,
viewers
may
also
choose
different
depths
of
news
coverage
.

``
A
menu
by
phone
could
let
you
decide
,
`
I
'm
interested
in
just
the
beginning
of
story
No.
1
,
and
I
want
story
No.
2
in
depth
,
''
Mr.
Monsky
says
.

``
You
'll
start
to
see
shows
where
viewers
program
the
program

Integrated
Resources
Inc.
,
the
troubled
financial-services
company
that
has
been
trying
to
sell
its
core
companies
to
restructure
debt
,
said
talks
with
a
potential
buyer
ended
.

Integrated
did
n't
identify
the
party
or
say
why
the
talks
failed
.

Last
week
another
potential
buyer
,
Whitehall
Financial
Group
--
which
had
agreed
in
August
to
purchase
most
of
Integrated
's
core
companies
for
$
310
million
--
ended
talks
with
Integrated
.

Integrated
said
that
it
would
continue
to
pursue
``
other
alternatives
''
to
sell
the
five
core
companies
and
that
a
group
of
senior
executives
plans
to
make
a
proposal
to
purchase
three
of
the
companies
--
Integrated
Resources
Equity
Corp.
,
Resources
Trust
Co.
and
Integrated
Resources
Asset
Management
Corp
.

A
price
was
n't
disclosed
.

Integrated
also
said
it
expects
to
report
a
second-quarter
loss
wider
than
the
earlier
estimate
of
about
$
600
million
.

The
company
did
n't
disclose
the
new
estimate
but
said
the
change
was
related
to
Integrated
's
failure
to
sell
its
core
businesses
,
as
well
as
``
other
events
,
''
which
it
did
n't
detail
,
that
occurred
after
its
announcement
last
week
that
it
was
in
talks
with
the
unidentified
prospective
buyer
.

Meanwhile
,
a
number
of
top
sales
producers
from
Integrated
Resources
Equity
will
meet
this
afternoon
in
Chicago
to
discuss
their
options
.

The
unit
is
a
loosely
constructed
group
of
about
3,900
independent
brokers

financial
planners
who
sell
insurance
,
annuities
,
limited
partnerships
,
mutual
funds
and
other
investments
for
Integrated
and
other
firms
.

The
sales
force
is
viewed
as
a
critical
asset
in
Integrated
's
attempt
to
sell
its
core
companies
.

Whitehall
cited
concerns
about
how
long
Integrated
would
be
able
to
hold
together
the
sales
force
as
one
reason
its
talks
with
Integrated
failed
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
yesterday
,
Integrated
closed
at
$
1.25
a
share
,
down
25
cents
.

Integrated
has
been
struggling
to
avoid
a
bankruptcy-law
filing
since
June
,
when
it
failed
to
make
interest
payments
on
nearly
$
1
billion
of
debt
.

Integrated
senior
and
junior
creditors
are
owed
a
total
of
about
$
1.8
billion

AN
EARTHQUAKE
STRUCK
Northern
California
,
killing
more
than
50
people
.

The
violent
temblor
,
which
lasted
about
15
seconds
and
registered
6.9
on
the
Richter
scale
,
also
caused
the
collapse
of
a
30-foot
section
of

Bay
Bridge
and
shook
Candlestick
Park

The
tremor
was
centered
near
Hollister
,
southeast
of
San
Francisco
,
and
was
felt
as
far
as
200
miles
away
.

Numerous
injuries
were
reported
.

Some
buildings
collapsed
,
gas
and
water
lines
ruptured
and
fires
raged
.

The
quake
,
which
also
caused
damage
in

Jose
and
Berkeley
,
knocked
out
electricity
and
telephones
,
cracked
roadways
and
disrupted

Senate
Democratic
leaders
said
they
had
enough
votes
to
defeat
a
proposed
constitutional
amendment

ban

is
aimed
at
skirting

rules
to
ensure
that
its
economy
becomes
as
open
as
the
other
industrialized
nations
by

Bush
assured
Roh
that

stand
by
its
security
commitments
``
as
long
as
there
is
a
threat
''
from

the
death
of

said
that
while

``
there

Moscow
has
n't
joined
efforts
,
led
by
Moslem
nations
,
to
expel
Israel
from
the
world

,
and
was
viewed
as
a
sign
of
improving
Soviet-Israeli
ties

Black

for
the
execution
of

II
,
although
he
probably
was
aware

amid
indications
the
takeover
may
take
weeks
to
be
revived
.

The
stock
has
fallen
$
87.25
,
or
31
%
,
in
the
three
trading
days
since
announcement
of
the
collapse
of
the
$
300-a-share
takeover
jolted
the
entire
stock
market
into
its
second-worst
plunge
ever
.

``
This
is
a
total
bloodbath
''
for
takeover-stock
traders
,
one
investment
banker
said
.

Los
Angeles
financier
Marvin
Davis
,
who
put
United
in
play
with
a
$
5.4
billion
bid
two
months
ago
,
last
night
proffered
both
a
ray
of
hope
and
an
extra
element
of
uncertainty
by
saying
he
remains
interested
in
acquiring
UAL
.

But
he
dropped
his
earlier
$
300-a-share
back-up
bid
,
saying
he
must
first
explore
bank
financing
.

Even
as
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
scrambled
to
line
up
bank
financing
for
a
revised
version
of
the
lapsed
labor-management
bid
,
British
Airways
,
a
15
%
partner
in
the
buying
group
,
indicated
it
wants
to
start
from
scratch
.

Its
partners
are
United
's
pilots
,
who
were
to
own
75
%
,
and
UAL
management
at
10
%
.

Adding
insult
to
injury
,
United
's
25,000-member
Machinists
'
union
,
which
helped
scuttle
financing
for
the
first
bid
,
yesterday
asked
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
and
other
UAL
directors
to
resign
.

A
similar
demand
was
made
by
a
group
that
represents
some
of
United
's
26,000
noncontract
employees
.

John
Peterpaul
,
Machinists
union
general
vice
president
,
attacked
Mr.
Wolf
as
``
greedy
and
irresponsible
''
for
pursuing
the
buy-out
.

Although
Mr.
Wolf
and
John
Pope
,
UAL
's
chief
financial
officer
,
stood
to
pocket
$
114.3
million
for
stock
and
options
in
the
buy-out
,
UAL
executives
planned
to
reinvest
only
$
15
million
in
the
new
company
.

The
blue-collar
machinists
,
longtime
rivals
of
the
white-collar
pilots
,
say
the
buyout
would
load
the
company
with
debt
and
weaken
its
finances
.

Confusion
about
the
two
banks
'
hurried
efforts
to
round
up
financing
for
a
new
bid
that
the
UAL
board
has
n't
even
seen
yet
helped
send
UAL
stock
spiraling
downward
.

And
rumors
of
forced
selling
by
takeover-stock
traders
triggered
a
25-point
downdraft
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
around
11:15
a.m.
EDT
yesterday
.

Yesterday
's
selling
began
after
a
Japanese
news
agency
reported
that
Japanese
banks
,
which
balked
at
the
first
bid
,
were
ready
to
reject
a
revised
version
at
around
$
250
a
share
,
or
$
5.65
billion
.

Several
reports
as
the
day
progressed
gave
vague
or
conflicting
indications
about
whether
banks
would
sign
up
.

Citicorp
,
for
example
,
said
only
that
it
had
``
expressions
of
interest
of
a
transaction
from
both
the
borrowers
and
the
banks
,
''
but
did
n't
have
an
agreement
.

Late
in
the
day
,
Mr.
Wolf
issued
a
onepage
statement
calling
Mr.
Peterpaul
's
blast
``
divisive
and
uncalled
for
.

''
But
he
gave
few
details
on
the
progress
toward
a
new
bid
,
saying
only
,
``
We
are
working
toward
a
revised
proposal
for
majority
employee
ownership
.

''
Meanwhile
,
in
another
sign
that
a
new
bid
is
n't
imminent
,
it
was
learned
that
the
UAL
board
held
a
telephone
meeting
Monday
to
hear
an
update
on
the
situation
,
but
that
a
formal
board
meeting
is
n't
likely
to
be
convened
until
early
next
week
.

In
London
,
British
Airways
Chairman
Lord
King
was
quoted
in
the
Times
as
declaring
he
is
``
not
prepared
to
take
my
shareholders
into
a
hasty
deal
.

''
Observers
said
it
appeared
that
British
Air
was
angered
at
the
way
the
bid
has
degenerated
into
confusion
,
as
well
as
by
the
banks
'
effort
to
round
up
financing
for
what
one
called
``
a
deal
that
is
n't
a
deal
.

''
The
effort
to
revive
the
bid
was
complicated
by
the
unwieldy
nature
of
the
three-party
buying
group
.

The
pilots
were
meeting
outside
Chicago
yesterday
.

But
British
Air
,
which
was
to
have
supplied
$
750
million
out
of
$
965
million
in
equity
financing
,
apparently
was
n't
involved
in
the
second
proposal
and
could
well
reject
it
even
if
banks
obtain
financing
.

A
group
of
United
's
noncontract
employees
said
in
a
statement
,
``
The
fact
that
Wolf
and
other
officers
were
going
to
line
their
pockets
with
literally
millions
of
dollars
while
instituting
severe
pay
cuts
on
the
nonunion
employees
of
United
is
not
only
deplorable
but
inexcusable
.

''
The
machinists
also
asked
for
an
investigation
by
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
into
possible
securities-law
violations
in
the
original
bid
for
UAL
by
Mr.
Davis
,
as
well
as
in
the
response
by
UAL
.

Last
week
,
just
before
the
bank
commitments
were
due
,
the
union
asked
the
U.S.
Labor
Department
to
study
whether
the
bid
violated
legal
standards
of
fairness
governing
employee
investment
funds
.

In
his
statement
,
Mr.
Wolf
said
,
``
We
continue
to
believe
our
approach
is
sound
,
and
that
it
is
far
better
for
all
employees
than
the
alternative
of
having
an
outsider
own
the
company
with
employees
paying
for
it
just
the
same
.

''
Mr.
Wolf
has
eschewed
merger
advice
from
a
major
Wall
Street
securities
firm
,
relying
instead
only
on
a
takeover
lawyer
,
Peter
Atkins
of
Skadden
Arps
Slate
Meagher
&
Flom
.

The
huge
drop
in
UAL
stock
prompted
one
takeover
stock
trader
,
George
Kellner
,
managing
partner
of
Kellner
,
DiLeo
&
Co.
,
to
deny
publicly
rumors
that
his
firm
was
going
out
of
business
.

Mr.
Kellner
said
that
despite
losses
on
UAL
stock
,
his
firm
's
health
is
``
excellent
.

''
The
stock
's
decline
also
has
left
the
UAL
board
in
a
quandary
.

Although
it
may
not
be
legally
obligated
to
sell
the
company
if
the
buy-out
group
ca
n't
revive
its
bid
,
it
may
have
to
explore
alternatives
if
the
buyers
come
back
with
a
bid
much
lower
than
the
group
's
original
$
300-a-share
proposal
.

At
a
meeting
Sept.
1
to
consider
the
labor-management
bid
,
the
board
also
was
informed
by
its
investment
adviser
,
First
Boston
Corp.
,
of
interest
expressed
by
buy-out
funds
including
Kohlberg
Kravis
Roberts
&
Co.
and
Forstmann
Little
&
Co.
,
as
well
as
by
Robert
Bass
,
Morgan
Stanley
's
buy-out
fund
,
and
Pan
Am
Corp
.

The
takeover-stock
traders
were
hoping
that
Mr.
Davis
or
one
of
the
other
interested
parties
might
re-emerge
with
the
situation
in
disarray
,
or
that
the
board
might
consider
a
recapitalization
.

Meanwhile
,
Japanese
bankers
said
they
were
still
hesitant
about
accepting
Citicorp
's
latest
proposal
.

Macmillan
Inc.
said
it
plans
a
public
offering
of
8.4
million
shares
of
its
Berlitz
International
Inc.
unit
at
$
19
to
$
21
a
share
.

The
offering
for
the
language
school
unit
was
announced
by
Robert
Maxwell
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
London-based
Maxwell
Communication
Corp.
,
which
owns
Macmillan
.

After
the
offering
is
completed
,
Macmillan
will
own
about
56
%
of
the
Berlitz
common
stock
outstanding
.

Five
million
shares
will
be
offered
in
the
U.S.
,
and
3.4
million
additional
shares
will
be
offered
in
concurrent
international
offerings
outside
the
U.S
.

Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co.
will
manage
the
offering
.

Macmillan
said
Berlitz
intends
to
pay
quarterly
dividends
on
the
stock
.

The
company
said
it
expects
to
pay
the
first
dividend
,
of
12.5
cents
a
share
,
in
the
1990
first
quarter
.

Berlitz
will
borrow
an
amount
equal
to
its
expected
net
proceeds
from
the
offerings
,
plus
$
50
million
,
in
connection
with
a
credit
agreement
with
lenders
.

The
total
borrowing
will
be
about
$
208
million
,
the
company
said
.

Proceeds
from
the
borrowings
under
the
credit
agreement
will
be
used
to
pay
an
$
80
million
cash
dividend
to
Macmillan
and
to
lend
the
remainder
of
about
$
128
million
to
Maxwell
Communications
in
connection
with
a
promissory
note
.

Proceeds
from
the
offering
will
be
used
to
repay
borrowings
under
the
short-term
parts
of
a
credit
agreement
.

Berlitz
,
which
is
based
in
Princeton
,
N.J.
,
provides
language
instruction
and
translation
services
through
more
than
260
language
centers
in
25
countries
.

In
the
past
five
years
,
more
than
68
%
of
its
sales
have
been
outside
the
U.S
.

Macmillan
has
owned
Berlitz
since
1966
.

In
the
first
six
months
of
this
year
,
Berlitz
posted
net
income
of
$
7.6
million
on
sales
of
$
106.2
million
,
compared
with
net
income
of
$
8.2
million
on
sales
of
$
90.6
million
.

Right
away
you
notice
the
following
things
about
a
Philip
Glass
concert
.

It
attracts
people
with
funny
hair
(
or
with
no
hair
--
in
front
of
me
a
girl
with
spiked
locks
sat
beside
a
boy
who
had
shaved
his
)
.

Whoever
constitute
the
local
Left
Bank
come
out
in
force
,
dressed
in
black
,
along
with
a
smattering
of
yuppies
who
want
to
be
on
the
cutting
edge
.

People
in
Glass
houses
tend
to
look
stoned
.

And
,
if
still
conscious
at
the
evening
's
end
,
you
notice
something
else
:
The
audience
,
at
first
entranced
and
hypnotized
by
the
music
,
releases
its
pent-up
feelings
in
collective
gratitude
.

Currently
in
the
middle
of
a
four-week
,
20-city
tour
as
a
solo
pianist
,
Mr.
Glass
has
left
behind
his
synthesizers
,
equipment
and
collaborators
in
favor
of
going
it
alone
.

He
sits
down
at
the
piano
and
plays
.

And
plays
.

Either
one
likes
it
or
one
does
n't
.

The
typical
Glass
audience
,
which
is
more
likely
to
be
composed
of
music
students
than
their
teachers
,
certainly
does
.

The
work
,
though
,
sounds
like
Muzak
for
spaceships
.

Philip
Glass
is
the
emperor
,
and
his
music
the
new
clothes
,
of
the
avant-garde
.

His
success
is
easy
to
understand
.

Softly
introducing
and
explaining
his
pieces
,
Mr.
Glass
looks
and
sounds
more
like
a
shaggy
poet
describing
his
work
than
a
classical
pianist
playing
a
recital
.

The
piano
compositions
,
which
have
been
labeled
variously
as
minimalist
,
Oriental
,
repetitive
,
cyclical
,
monophonic
and
hypnotic
,
are
relentlessly
tonal
(
therefore
unthreatening
)
,
unvaryingly
rhythmic
(
therefore
soporific
)
,
and
unflaggingly
harmonious
but
unmelodic
(
therefore
both
pretty
and
unconventional
)
.

It
is
music
for
people
who
want
to
hear
something
different
but
do
n't
want
to
work
especially
hard
at
the
task
.

It
is
E-Z
listening
for
the
now
generation
.

Mr.
Glass
has
inverted
the
famous
modernist
dictum
``
less
is
more
.

''
His
more
is
always
less
.

Far
from
being
minimalist
,
the
music
unabatingly
torments
us
with
apparent
novelties
not
so
cleverly
disguised
in
the
simplicities
of
time
,
octave
intervals
,
and
ragtime
or
gospel
chord
progressions
.

But
the
music
has
its
charm
,
and
Mr.
Glass
has
constructed
his
solo
program
around
a
move
from
the
simple
to
the
relatively
complex
.

``
Opening
''
(
1981
)
,
from
Glassworks
,
introduces
the
audience
to
the
Glass
technique
:
Never
straying
too
far
from
the
piano
's
center
,
Mr.
Glass
works
in
the
two
octaves
on
either
side
of
middle
C
,
and
his
fingers
seldom
leave
the
keys
.

There
is
a
recognizable
musical
style
here
,
but
not
a
particular
performance
style
.

The
music
is
not
especially
pianistic
;
indeed
,
it
's
hard
to
imagine
a
bad
performance
of
it
.

Nothing
bravura
,
no
arpeggios
,
no
ticklish
fingering
problems
challenge
the
performer
.

We
hear
,
we
may
think
,
inner
voices
,
but
they
all
seem
to
be
saying
the
same
thing
.

With
``
Planet
News
,
''
music
meant
to
accompany
readings
of
Allen
Ginsberg
's
``
Wichita
Vortex
Sutra
,
''
Mr.
Glass
gets
going
.

His
hands
sit
farther
apart
on
the
keyboard
.

Seventh
chords
make
you
feel
as
though
he
may
break
into
a
(
very
slow
)
improvisatory
riff
.

The
chords
modulate
,
but
there
is
little
filigree
even
though
his
fingers
begin
to
wander
over
more
of
the
keys
.

Contrasts
predictably
accumulate
:
First
the
music
is
loud
,
then
it
becomes
soft
,
then
(
you
realize
)
it
becomes
louder
again
.

``
The
Fourth
Knee
Play
,
''
an
interlude
from
``
Einstein
on
the
Beach
,
''
is
like
a
toccata
but
it
does
n't
seem
to
move
much
beyond
its
left-hand
ground
in
``
Three
Blind
Mice
.

''
When
Mr.
Glass
decides
to
get
really
fancy
,
he
crosses
his
hands
and
hits
a
resonant
bass
note
with
his
right
hand
.

He
does
this
in
at
least
three
of
his
solo
pieces
.

You
might
call
it
a
leitmotif
or
a
virtuoso
accomplishment
.

In
``
Mad
Rush
,
''
which
came
from
a
commission
to
write
a
piece
of
indeterminate
length
(
Mr.
Glass
charmingly
,
and
tellingly
,
confessed
that
``
this
was
no
problem
for
me
''
)
,
an
A
section
alternates
with
a
B
section
several
times
before
the
piece
ends
unresolved
.

Not
only
is
the
typical
Glasswork
open-ended
,
it
is
also
often
multiple
in
its
context
(
s
)
.

``
Mad
Rush
''
began
its
life
as
the
accompaniment
to
the
Dalai
Lama
's
first
public
address
in
the
U.S.
,
when
Mr.
Glass
played
it
on
the
organ
at
New
York
's
Cathedral
of
St.
John
the
Divine
.

Later
it
was
performed
on
Radio
Bremen
in
Germany
,
and
then
Lucinda
Childs
took
it
for
one
of
her
dance
pieces
.

The
point
is
that
any
piece
can
be
used
as
background
music
for
virtually
anything
.

The
evening
ended
with
Mr.
Glass
's
``
Metamorphosis
,
''
another
multiple
work
.

Parts
1
,
2
,
and
5
come
from
the
soundtrack
of
Errol
Morris
's
acclaimed
film
,
``
The
Thin
Blue
Line
,
''
and
the
two
other
parts
from
incidental
music
to
two
separate
dramatizations
of
the
Kafka
story
of
the
same
name
.

When
used
as
background
in
this
way
,
the
music
has
an
appropriate
eeriness
,
as
when
a
two-note
phrase
,
a
descending
minor
third
,
accompanies
the
seemingly
endless
litany
of
reports
,
interviews
and
confessions
of
witnesses
in
the
Morris
film
.

Served
up
as
a
solo
,
however
,
the
music
lacks
the
resonance
provided
by
a
context
within
another
medium
.

Admirers
of
Mr.
Glass
may
agree
with
the
critic
Richard
Kostelanetz
's
sense
that
the
1974
``
Music
in
Twelve
Parts
''
is
as
encyclopedic
and
weighty
as
``
The
Well-Tempered
Clavier
.

''
But
while
making
the
obvious
point
that
both
composers
develop
variations
from
themes
,
this
comparison
ignores
the
intensely
claustrophobic
nature
of
Mr.
Glass
's
music
.

Its
supposedly
austere
minimalism
overlays
a
bombast
that
makes
one
yearn
for
the
astringency
of
neoclassical
Stravinsky
,
the
genuinely
radical
minimalism
of
Berg
and

and
what
in
retrospect
even
seems
like
concision
in
Mahler
.

Mr.
Spiegelman
is
professor
of
English
at
Southern
Methodist
University
and
editor
of
the
Southwest
Review
.

Honeywell
Inc.
said
it
hopes
to
complete
shortly
the
first
of
two
sales
of
shares
in
its
Japanese
joint
venture
,
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
for
about
$
280
million
.

The
company
would
n't
disclose
the
buyer
of
the
initial
16
%
stake
.

Proceeds
of
the
sale
,
expected
to
be
completed
next
week
,
would
be
used
to
repurchase
as
many
as
10
million
shares
of
Honeywell
stock
,
the
company
said
.

Honeywell
said
it
is
negotiating
the
sale
of
a
second
stake
in
Yamatake-Honeywell
,
but
indicated
it
intends
to
hold
at
least
20
%
of
the
joint
venture
's
stock
long
term
.

A
20
%
stake
would
allow
Honeywell
to
include
Yamatake
earnings
in
its
results
.

Honeywell
previously
said
it
intended
to
reduce
its
holding
in
the
Japanese
concern
as
part
of
a
restructuring
plan
which
also
calls
for
a
reduction
of
dependence
on
weapons
sales
.

Yesterday
a
spokeswoman
said
the
company
was
``
pleased
with
our
progress
''
in
that
regard
and
``
hopes
to
provide
additional
details
soon
.

''
Honeywell
said
its
Defense
and
Marine
Systems
group
incurred
delays
in
shipping
some
undisclosed
contracts
during
the
third
quarter
,
resulting
in
lower
operating
profit
for
that
business
.

Overall
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
74.4
million
,
or
$
1.73
a
share
,
for
the
three
months
ended
Oct.
1
compared
with
a
loss
of
$
41.4
million
,
or
98
cents
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
previous
period
's
results
included
a
$
108
million
pretax
charge
related
to
unrecoverable
contract
costs
and
a
$
12.3
million
pretax
gain
on
real
estate
sales
.

Sales
for
the
latest
quarter
were
flat
,
at
$
1.72
billion
.

For
the
nine
months
,
Honeywell
reported
earnings
of
$
212.1
million
,
or
$
4.92
a
share
,
compared
with
earnings
of
$
47.9
million
,
or
$
1.13
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Sales
declined
slightly
to
$
5.17
billion
.

Once
again
,
your
editorial
page
misstates
the
law
to
conform
to
your
almost
beatific
misperceptions
.

In
an
excursus
of
little
relevance
to
his
central
point
about
private
enforcement
suits
by
environmental
groups
,
Michael
S.
Greve
informs
your
readers
,
``
...
the
Clean
Water
Act
is
written
upon
the
presumption
--
the
pretense
,
rather
--
that
nothing
but
zero
risk
will
do
;
it
establishes
a
legal
standard
of
zero
discharge
''
(
``
Congress's
Environmental
Buccaneers
,
''
Sept.
18
)
.

This
statement
surely
buttresses
your
editorial
viewpoint
that
environmental
protection
is
generally
silly
or
excessive
,
but
it
is
simply
wrong
.

The
Clean
Water
Act
contains
no
``
legal
standard
''
of
zero
discharge
.

It
requires
that
``
discharges
of
pollutants
''
into
the
``
waters
of
the
United
States
''
be
authorized
by
permits
that
reflect
the
effluent
limitations
developed
under
section
301
.

Whatever
may
be
the
problems
with
this
system
,
it
scarcely
reflects
``
zero
risk
''
or
``
zero
discharge
.

''
Perhaps
Mr.
Greve
was
confused
by
Congress
's
meaningless
statement
of
``
the
national
goal
''
in
section
101
,
which
indeed
calls
for
the
elimination
of
discharges
--
by
1985
,
no
less
.

This
fatuous
statement
was
not
taken
seriously
when
enacted
in
1972
,
and
should
not
now
be
confused
with
the
operative
provisions
of
the
statute
.

Thus
,
you
do
the
public
a
great
disservice
when
Mr.
Greve
suggests
,
even
facetiously
,
that
the
Clean
Water
Act
prohibits
the
preparation
of
a
scotch
and
water
;
your
tippling
readers
may
be
led
to
believe
that
nothing
but
chance
or
oversight
protects
them
,
as
they
cower
in
the
night
with
their
scotch
and
waters
,
from
the
hairyknuckled
knock
of
the
Sierra
Club
at
their
doors
.

Robert
J.
McManus
Washington
National
Geographic
,
the
sixth-largest
U.S.
magazine
,
is
attracting
more
readers
than
ever
and
offers
the
glossy
,
high-toned
pages
that
upscale
advertisers
love
.

So
why
did
advertising
pages
plunge
by
almost
10
%
and
ad
revenue
by
7.2
%
in
the
first
half
?
To
hear
advertisers
tell
it
,
the
magazine
just
has
n't
kept
up
with
the
times
.

Despite
renewed
interest
by
the
public
in
such
topics
as
the
environment
and
the
Third
World
,
it
has
n't
been
able
to
shake
its
reputation
as
a
magazine
boys
like
to
flip
through
in
search
of
topless
tribe
women
.

Worse
,
it
lagged
behind
competitors
in
offering
now-standard
gimmicks
,
from
regional
editions
to
discounts
for
frequent
advertisers
.

But
now
,
the
magazine
is
attempting
to
fight
back
,
with
an
ambitious
plan
including
a
revamped
sales
strategy
and
a
surprisingly
aggressive
ad
campaign
.

Advertisers
do
n't
think
of
the
magazine
first
,
says
Joan
McCraw
,
who
joined
in
April
as
national
advertising
director
.

``
What
we
want
to
do
is
take
a
more
aggressive
stance
.

People
did
n't
believe
we
were
in
tune
with
the
marketplace
,
and
in
many
ways
we
were
n't
.

''
The
101-year-old
magazine
has
never
had
to
woo
advertisers
with
quite
so
much
fervor
before
.

It
largely
rested
on
its
hard-to-fault
demographics
:
10.8
million
subscribers
in
the
first
half
,
up
from
10.5
million
a
year
ago
;
an
average
age
of
42
for
readers
--
at
the
height
of
their
consuming
years
;
loyalty
to
the
tune
of
an
85
%
average
subscription
renewal
rate
.

The
magazine
had
its
best
year
yet
in
1988
,
when
it
celebrated
its
centennial
and
racked
up
a
17
%
gain
in
ad
pages
,
to
283
.

But
this
year
,
when
the
hullabaloo
surrounding
its
centennial
died
,
so
too
did
some
advertiser
interest
.

The
reason
,
ad
executives
say
,
is
that
the
entire
magazine
business
has
been
soft
--
and
National
Geographic
has
some
quirks
that
make
it
especially
unattractive
during
a
soft
market
.

Perhaps
the
biggest
of
those
factors
is
its
high
ad
prices
--
$
130,000
for
a
four-color
page
,
vs.
$
47,000
for
the
Smithsonian
,
a
comparable
publication
with
a
far
smaller
circulation
.

When
ad
dollars
are
tight
,
the
high
page
cost
is
a
major
deterrent
for
advertisers
,
who
generally
want
to
appear
regularly
in
a
publication
or
not
at
all
.

Even
though
National
Geographic
offers
far
more
readers
than
does
a
magazine
like
Smithsonian
,
``
the
page
costs
you
an
arm
and
a
leg
to
develop
any
frequency
,
''
says
Harry
Glass
,
New
York
media
manager
for
Bozell
Inc
.

To
combat
that
problem
,
National
Geographic
,
like
other
magazines
,
began
offering
regional
editions
allowing
advertisers
to
appear
in
only
a
portion
of
its
magazines
--
for
example
,
ads
can
run
only
in
the
magazines
sent
to
subscribers
in
the
largest
25
markets
.

But
the
magazine
was
slower
than
its
competitors
to
come
up
with
its
regional
editions
,
and
until
last
year
offered
fewer
of
them
than
did
competitors
.

Time
magazine
,
for
example
,
has
more
than
100
separate
editions
going
to
different
regions
,
top
management
,
and
other
groups
.

Another
sticking
point
for
advertisers
was
National
Geographic
's
tradition
of
lumping
its
ads
together
,
usually
at
the
beginning
or
end
of
the
magazine
,
rather
than
spreading
ads
out
among
its
articles
,
as
most
magazines
do
.

And
National
Geographic
's
smaller-than-average
size
means
extra
production
costs
for
advertisers
.

But
Ms.
McCraw
says
the
magazine
is
fighting
back
.

It
now
offers
30
regional
editions
,
it
very
recently
began
running
ads
adjacent
to
articles
,
and
it
has
been
beefing
up
its
sales
force
.

And
it
just
launched
a
promotional
campaign
to
tell
chief
executives
,
marketing
directors
,
and
media
executives
just
that
.

The
centerpiece
of
the
promotion
is
its
new
ad
campaign
,
into
which
the
magazine
will
pour
about
$
500,000
,
mostly
in
the
next
few
weeks
.

The
campaign
,
created
by
Omnicom
Group
's
DDB
Needham
agency
,
takes
advantage
of
the
eye-catching
photography
that
National
Geographic
is
known
for
.

In
one
ad
,
a
photo
of
the
interior
of
the
Sainte-Chapelle
in
Paris
is
paired
with
the
headline
,
``
The
only
book
more
respected
than
ours
does
n't
accept
advertising
.

''
Another
ad
pictures
a
tree
ant
,
magnified
80
times
,
with
the
headline
,
``
For
impact
far
beyond
your
size
consider
our
regional
editions
.

''
Ms.
McCraw
says
she
wants
the
campaign
to
help
attract
advertisers
in
10
categories
,
including
corporate
,
financial
services
,
consumer
electronics
,
insurance
and
food
.

Her
goal
:
to
top
300
ad
pages
in
1990
,
up
from
about
274
this
year
.

Whether
she
can
meet
that
ambitious
goal
is
still
far
from
certain
.

``
The
ad
campaign
is
meant
to
contemporize
the
thought
of
National
Geographic
,
''
she
says
.

``
We
want
it
to
be
a
'90s
kind
of
image
.

The
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
plans
to
restrict
dual
trading
on
commodity
exchanges
,
a
move
almost
certain
to
infuriate
exchange
officials
and
traders
.

The
CFTC
said
it
will
propose
the
restrictions
after
the
release
of
a
study
that
shows
little
economic
benefit
resulting
from
dual
trading
and
cites
``
problems
''
associated
with
the
practice
.

Dual
trading
gives
an
exchange
trader
the
right
to
trade
both
for
his
own
account
and
for
customers
.

The
issue
exploded
this
year
after
a
Federal
Bureau
of
Investigation
operation
led
to
charges
of
widespread
trading
abuses
at
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
and
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
.

While
not
specifically
mentioned
in
the
FBI
charges
,
dual
trading
became
a
focus
of
attempts
to
tighten
industry
regulations
.

Critics
contend
that
traders
were
putting
buying
or
selling
for
their
own
accounts
ahead
of
other
traders
'
customer
orders
.

Traders
are
likely
to
oppose
such
restrictions
because
dual
trading
provides
a
way
to
make
money
in
slower
markets
where
there
is
a
shortage
of
customer
orders
.

The
exchanges
contend
that
dual
trading
improves
liquidity
in
the
markets
because
traders
can
buy
or
sell
even
when
they
do
n't
have
a
customer
order
in
hand
.

The
exchanges
say
liquidity
becomes
a
severe
problem
for
thinly
traded
contracts
such
as
those
with
a
long
time
remaining
before
expiration
.

The
CFTC
may
take
those
arguments
into
account
by
allowing
exceptions
to
its
restrictions
.

The
agency
did
n't
cite
specific
situations
where
dual
trading
might
be
allowed
,
but
smaller
exchanges
or
contracts
that
need
additional
liquidity
are
expected
to
be
among
them
.

Wendy
Gramm
,
the
agency
's
chairman
,
told
the
Senate
Agriculture
Committee
that
she
expects
the
study
to
be
released
within
two
weeks
and
the
rule
changes
to
be
completed
by
Thanksgiving
.

The
study
,
by
the
CFTC
's
division
of
economic
analysis
,
shows
that
``
a
trade
is
a
trade
,
''
a
member
of
the
study
team
said
.

Whether
a
trade
is
done
on
a
dual
or
non-dual
basis
,
the
member
said
,
``
does
n't
seem
to
have
much
economic
impact
.

''
Currently
,
most
traders
on
commodity
exchanges
specialize
in
trading
either
for
customer
accounts
,
which
makes
them
brokers
,
or
for
their
own
accounts
as
socalled
locals
.

``
The
tests
indicate
that
dual
and
non-dual
traders
are
similar
in
terms
of
the
trade
executions
and
liquidity
they
provide
to
the
market
,
''
Mrs.
Gramm
told
the
Senate
panel
.

Members
of
Congress
have
proposed
restricting
dual
trading
in
bills
to
reauthorize
CFTC
operations
.

The
House
's
bill
would
prohibit
dual
trading
in
markets
with
daily
average
volume
of
7,000
contracts
or
more
,
comprising
those
considered
too
difficult
to
track
without
a
sophisticated
computer
system
.

The
Senate
bill
would
force
the
CFTC
to
suspend
dual
trading
if
an
exchange
ca
n't
show
that
its
oversight
system
can
detect
dual-trading
abuses
.

So
far
,
one
test
of
restricting
dual
trading
has
worked
well
.

The
Chicago
Merc
banned
dual
trading
in
its
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
futures
pit
in
1987
.

Under
the
rules
,
traders
decide
before
a
session
begins
whether
they
will
trade
for
their
own
account
or
for
customers
.

Traders
who
stand
on
the
pit
's
top
step
,
where
most
customer
orders
are
executed
,
ca
n't
trade
for
themselves
.

A
Merc
spokesman
said
the
plan
has
n't
made
much
difference
in
liquidity
in
the
pit
.

``
It
's
too
soon
to
tell
...
but
people
do
n't
seem
to
be
unhappy
with
it
,
''
he
said
.

He
said
he
would
n't
comment
on
the
CFTC
plan
until
the
exchange
has
seen
the
full
proposal
.

But
at
a
meeting
last
week
,
Tom
Donovan
,
the
Board
of
Trade
's
president
,
told
commodity
lawyers
:
``
Dual
trading
is
definitely
worth
saving
.

It
adds
something
to
the
market
.

But
some

are
negotiating
looser

,
while
others
decline
to
deal
at

Nissan
Motor

division

to
insist
that

furnish

only

dealership

on

second
floor

Yet
some
dealers
have
turned
down
Infiniti
or
Lexus
franchises
because
they
were
unwilling
or
unable
to
meet
the
design
requirements
.

Lee
Seidman
of
Cleveland
says
Infiniti
``
was
a
bear
on
interiors
''
but
at
least
let
him
retrofit
an
existing
building
--
without
the
stream
.

Mr.
Seidman
says
he
turned
down
a
Lexus
franchise
in
part
because
``
the
building
was
gorgeous
but
very
expensive
.

To
head
off
arguments
,
Infiniti
offers
dealers
cash
bonuses

Dictation
Device
's
Saga
Plays
Back
a
Lesson
PRODUCTS
DON'T
have
to
be
first
to
be
winners
.

That
's
the
lesson
offered
through
one
case
study
featured
in
a
design
exhibit
.

Dictaphone
Corp.
was
caught
off
guard
in
1974
when
its
main
competitor
,
Lanier
Office
Products
of
Japan
,
introduced
a
microcassette
dictation
recorder
half
the
size
of
standard
cassette
devices
.

Blocked
by
patent
protection
from
following
suit
,
Dictaphone
decided
to
go
a
step
further
and
cut
the
cassette
in
half
again
--
down
to
the
length
of
a
paperclip
.

By
1979
,
designers
and
engineers
at
Dictaphone
,
a
Pitney
Bowes
subsidiary
,
had
produced
a
working
model
of
a
``
picocassette
''
recorder
.

By
1982
,
however
,
the
patent
status
of
the
Lanier
microcassette
had
changed
,
permitting
Dictaphone
to
develop
its
own
competitive
micro
system
,
which
it
did
.

Marketing
and
sales
departments
then
urged
abandonment
of
the
pico
project
.

But
others
said
pico
should
proceed
.

Both
were
right
.

Dictaphone
went
ahead
and
introduced
the
pico
in
1985
,
but
it
has
n't
sold
well
.

To
date
,
says
Emil
Jachmann
,
a
Dictaphone
vice
president
,
it
has
``
broken
even
or
shown
a
small
loss
.

''
Nevertheless
,
the
device
has
been
successful
in
other
ways
.

It
helped
Dictaphone
attract
better
engineers
,
and
it
provided
new
technology
for
other
company
products
.

The
picocassette
recorder
also
helped
transform
the
company
's
reputation
from
follower
to
leading-edge
innovator
.

``
It
gave
me
great
pride
to
see
the
inventor
of
the
microcassette
in
Japan
look
at
the
pico
and
shake
his
head
and
say
`
unbelievable
,
'
''
says
Mr.
Jachmann
.

Dictaphone
's
picocassette
recorder
is
one
of
13
case
studies
in
the
TRIAD
Design
Project
,
sponsored
by
the
Design
Management
Institute
of
Boston
and
Harvard
Business
School
.

The
studies
are
on
exhibit
at
Harvard
this
month
and
will
travel
to
Chicago
's
Institute
of
Design
and
the
University
of

A
Rake
's
Progress
Means
Branching
Out
ONE
DAY
Carl
Barrett
of
Mobile
,
Ala.
,
was
raking
some
sycamore
leaves
,
but
the
rake
kept
riding
up
over
the
piles
.

The
harder
he
tried
to
push
them
into
large
piles
,
the
closer
he
came
to
breaking
the
rake
and
straining
his
back
.

So
Mr.
Barrett
,
then
vice
president
of
the
Alabama
Steamship
Association
,
took
a
steel-toothed
garden
rake
and
taped
it
to
the
underside
of
a
leaf
rake
about
nine
inches
up
.

His
crude
device
worked
:
The
lower
teeth
gathered
the
leaves
into
a
pile
,
while
the
higher
,
harder
teeth
moved
the
top
of
the
pile
.

Now
incorporated
into
a
polypropylene
rake
,
the
four-inch
prongs
,
or
``
wonderbars
,
''
also
are
supposed
to
aid
in
picking
up
leaves
.

One
customer
,
Donald
Blaggs
of
Mobile
,
says
the
Barrett
Rake
allowed
him
to
do
his
lawn
in
2
hours
,
two
hours
less
than
usual
.

But
other
rake
makers
have
their
doubts
.

Richard
Mason
,
president
of
Ames
Co.
in
Parkersburg
,
W.
Va.
,
says
the
Barrett
rake
``
makes
sense
,
''
but
it
would
be
``
tough
''
to
explain
to
consumers
.

John
Stoner
,
marketing
director
for
True
Temper
Corp.
,
a
subsidiary
of
Black
&
Decker
,
says
people
do
n't
want
to
move
a
leaf
pile
.

``
They
either
pick
it
up
,
''
he
says
,
``
or
they
start
pulling
from
a
fresh
direction
.

''
Odds
and
Ends
NO
MORE
STUBBED
toes
or
bruised
shins
,
promises
Geste
Corp.
of
Goshen
,
Ind.
,
the
designer
of
a
bed
support
to
replace
traditional
frames
.

Four
tubular
steel
``
Bedfellows

''
each
roughly
in
the
shape
of
a
``

''
are
attached
to
the
bottom
of
the
box
spring
in
a
recessed
position
...
.

Nearly
half
of
U.S.
consumers
say
they
'll
pay
up
to
5
%
more
for
packaging
that
can
be
recycled
or
is
biodegradable
,
according
to
a
survey
commissioned
by
the
Michael
Peters
Group
,
a
design
consultant
.

The
Pentagon
is
a
haunted
house
.

Living
there
for
six
years
was
really
scary
.

The
ghosts
of
the
past
are
everywhere
:
They
are
kept
at
bay
only
by
feeding
them
vast
quantities
of
our
defense
budget
.

Some
can
be
bought
off
relatively
cheaply
.

During
the
Korean
War
,
Gen.
Douglas
MacArthur
demanded
and
got
,
in
addition
to
his
U.N.
command
in
Korea
,
his
own
naval
command
in
Japan
,
NavforJapan
.

Those
obsolete
operations
cost
less
than
$
2
billion
a
year
,
and
keep
Mac
's
ghost
quiet
.

That
's
about
all
it
costs
to
appease
Adm.
Erich
Raeder
's
ghost
.

In
1941
,
Raeder
and
the
German
navy
threatened
to
attack
the
Panama
Canal
,
so
we
created
the
Southern
Command
in
Panama
.

The
Southern
Command
has
grown
even
bigger
since
the
war
because
Raeder
's
ghost
sometimes
runs
through
the
E
ring
dressed
like
Gen.
Noriega
.

The
Command
's
huge
bureaucracy
is
needed
to
analyze
whether
leaders
of
coups
against
Gen.
Noriega
meet
the
War
Powers
Act
's
six
points
,
Cap
Weinberger
's
seven
points
,
the
Intelligence
Committee
's
32
points
and
Woodrow
Wilson
's
14
points
necessary
to
justify
U.S.
support
.

So
far
no
one
has
.

The
ghost
of
the
Soviet
brigade
discovered
in
Cuba
back
in
the
'70s
costs
just
a
few
hundred
million
:
the
price
of
the
Caribbean
Command
in
Key
West
that
President
Carter
created
in
1980
.

The
brigade
has
n't
been
heard
from
since
,
but
we
keep
the
staff
around
just
in
case
.

George
Marshall
's
ghost
is
much
more
difficult
to
keep
happy
.

We
keep
a
lot
of
shrines
to
him
around
the
Pentagon
:
statues
,
busts
,
relics
and
such
.

The
Army
headquarters
on
the
third
deck
of
the
Pentagon
used
to
burn
a
lot
of
incense
to
him
,
but
the
Navy
headquarters
on
the
fourth
deck
made
them
stop
it
.

You
see
,
Marshall
had
this
thing
about
the
Navy
and
the
Marines
--
he
wanted
to
make
them
part
of
the
Army
but
Secretary
of
the
Navy
James
Forrestal
blocked
him
.

Now
his
ghost
wo
n't
let
up
till
it
's
done
.

To
keep
him
quiet
we
invent
a
new
unified
command
every
year
or
so
run
by
the
Army
or
the
Air
Force
and
put
more
of
the
Navy
and
Marines
under
it
.

But
we
still
hear
him
moaning
at
night
because
the
Navy
has
a
few
ships
left
,
and
to
satisfy
him
the
Navy
's
sea
lift
forces
were
given
to
a
new
Air
Force
bureaucracy
in
Illinois
,
its
space
operations
to
another
command
in
Colorado
,
the
frogmen
to
a
new
Army
bureaucracy
in
Fort
Bragg
,
and
the
Navy
's
Indian
Ocean
and
Persian
Gulf
forces
to
an
Army
bureaucracy
in
Florida
.

Which
brings
up
the
worst
and
meanest
ghost
of
all
--
the
ghost
of
the
shah
of
Iran
.

When
the
shah
died
,
President
Carter
was
so
scared
that
the
shah
's
ghost
would
blame
him
for
shoving
him
out
to
make
way
for
the
ayatollah
that
he
declared
the
Carter
Doctrine
.

Mr.
Carter
said
he
would
go
to
war
to
stop
anyone
from
trying
to
grab
Iran
.

But
that
ghost
would
n't
settle
for
words
,
he
wanted
money
and
people
--
lots
.

So
Mr.
Carter
formed
three
new
Army
divisions
and
gave
them
to
a
new
bureaucracy
in
Tampa
called
the
Rapid
Deployment
Force
.

But
that
ghost
was
n't
fooled
;
he
knew
the
RDF
was
neither
rapid
nor
deployable
nor
a
force
--
even
though
it
cost
$
8
billion
or
$
10
billion
a
year
.

After
Mr.
Carter
was
defeated
in
1980
,
the
shah
's
ghost
claimed
the
credit
and
then
went
after
President
Reagan
and
Cap
Weinberger
.

I
saw
what
he
did
to
them
firsthand
.

It
made
my
shoelaces
dance
with
terror
.

Why
,
he
used
to
lay
in
wait
for
Cap
;
suddenly
he
'd
leap
from
behind
some
statue
of
Marshall
onto
Cap
's
chest
and
grab
him
by
the
throat
and
choke
him
till
he
coughed
up
an
additional
$
2
billion
or
so
.

Cap
added
four
more
divisions
to
the
Army
,
two
active
and
two
reserve
;
two
carrier
groups
to
the
Navy
;
a
division
--
equivalent
to
the
Marines
;
and
the
C-5B
,
KC-10
,
C-17
and
a
thousand
tactical
aircraft
to
the
Air
Force
.

He
bought
$
4
billion
in
prepositioning
ships
and
$
7
billion
in
ammo
and
equipment
to
fill
them
,
and
parked
them
at
a
new
$
6
billion
base
at
Diego
Garcia
in
the
middle
of
the
Indian
Ocean
.

He
dedicated
all
these
new
forces
to
the
Persian
Gulf
.

One
night
both
Marshall
's
ghost
and
the
shah
's
ghost
together
caught
Cap
and
threw
him
to
the
ground
.

Before
they
let
him
go
he
added
a
thousand
bureaucrats
to
the
RDF
in
Tampa
and
renamed
it
Central
Command
.

He
gave
those
bureaucrats
charge
of
all
naval
operations
in
the
Persian
Gulf
and
Indian
Ocean
.

Marshall
figured
it
would
be
good
training
for
those
soldiers
--
someday
maybe
they
would
get
the
whole
Navy
.

They
had
fun
moving
the
carriers
around
,
but
it
turned
out
that
they
had
forgotten
all
about
mine
sweepers
.

But
the
shah
still
kept
leaping
out
at
Cap
,
so
Cap
bought
a
hundred
merchant
ships
more
and
$
7
billion
of
loading
barges
,
ramps
,
etc.
,
in
order
that
those
seven
new
Army
divisions
and
three
Marine
brigades
could
unload
from
all
those
new
ships
and
aircraft
and
go
to
war
in
the
Zagros
mountains
.

Then
suddenly
Ike
's
ghost
came
to
visit
and
said
,
``
What
the
hell
are
you
doing
planning
for
a
land
war
in
Asia
12,000
miles
away
?
We
'd
get
our
asses
kicked
.

''
Lucky
for
Cap
,
Ike
was
easygoing
and
soon
went
away
,
while
the
shah
--
he
kept
coming
back
.

So
the
U.S.
found
itself
paying
about
$
2
billion
in
baksheesh
to
various
Arab
potentates
for
basing
rights
around
the
Indian
Ocean
.

We
had
great
success
in
Somalia
.

But
then
it
turned
out
that
President
Siad
Barrah
was
not
at
all
a
nice
person
and
the
Navy
pointed
out
that
the
base
he
promised
us
in
Berbera
had
silted
up
about
a
hundred
years
ago
and
anyway
was
1,244
miles
from
the
mouth
of
the
Gulf
.

(
But
who
's
counting
.

)
Still
,
Berbera
was
the
best
we
could
get
,
so
we
stay
in
bed
with
President
Barrah
.

All
these
reports
about
him
committing
genocide
are
probably
exaggerated
anyway
.

But
would
n't
you
know
,
now
that
we
are
spending
jillions
of
dollars
,
and
have
built
those
new
divisions
and
new
air
wings
,
and
have
positioned
all
these
ships
and
supplies
to
fight
the
Russians
in
Iran
,
the
Russians
seem
to
have
lost
interest
in
the
whole
subject
.

Meanwhile
,
Congress
is
cutting
huge
chunks
out
of
the
rest
of
the
defense
budget
.

Predictably
,
some
Navy
guys
said
:
``
Do
we
still
need
to
keep
all
18
Army
divisions
on
active
duty
and
all
those
extra
land-based
aircraft
without
bases
and
all
those
Army
guys
playing
admiral
in
Tampa
?
Could
n't
we
save
$
20
billion
or
$
30
billion
a
year
by
shifting
that
stuff
to
the
reserves
?
And
why
not
save
the
costs
of
a
thousand
bureaucrats
by
abolishing
Central
Command
and
putting
responsibility
for
Gulf
naval
operations
back
where
it
belongs
,
afloat
with
the
task
force
commander
in
the
Gulf
?
And
where
were
all
our
handsomely
paid
Indian
Ocean
allies
last
year
when
our
convoys
were
being
attacked
?
''
Questions
like
that
really
stir
up
Marshall
's
ghost
.

He
appeared
late
one
night
in
the
bedroom
of
the
new
defense
secretary
,
Dick
Cheney
.

Marshall
came
clanking
in
like
Marley
's
ghost
dragging
those
chains
of
brigades
and
air
wings
and
links
with
Arab
despots
.

He
would
n't
leave
until
Mr.
Cheney
promised
to
do
whatever
the
Pentagon
systems
analysts
told
him
.

So
next
day
Mr.
Cheney
went
out
and
did
just
that
:
He
canceled
the
600-ship
Navy
and
cut
back
one
carrier
and
20
frigates
.

Then
he
canceled
production
of
the
Navy
's
most
important
carrier
aircraft
,
the
F-14
and
the
A-6
.

On
the
other
hand
,
Mr.
Cheney
retained
all
those
new
land
forces
.

Marshall
's
ghost
is
satisfied
for
now
,
but
he
'll
be
back
.

What
with
Halloween
coming
and
bigger
defense
cuts
looming
,
more
and
more
Pentagon
bureaucrats
are
crawling
under
their
desks
.

They
know
that
they
can
hold
off
the
ghosts
only
a
little
while
longer
by
cutting
carriers
and
ships
.

Then
the
whole
thing
will
start
to
collapse
,
just
as
it
did
in
the
1970s
,
and
the
ghosts
and
banshees
will
be
howling
through
the
place
turning
people
's
hair
white
.

Gives
me
the
willies
just
thinking
about
it
.

Mr.
Lehman
,
a
Reagan
Navy
secretary
,
is
a
managing
director
of
PaineWebber
.

The
metal
and
marble
lobby
of
CenTrust
Bank
's
headquarters
is
grander
than
your
average
savings
and
loan
.

For
one
thing
,
there
is
an
old
master
on
the
wall
--
``
Samuel
Anointing
David
,
''
a
big
baroque
canvas
painted
by
Mattia
Preti
,
a
17th-century
Neapolitan
.

At
the
moment
,
however
,
the
painting
is
a
nagging
reminder
of
the
problems
that
have
engulfed
CenTrust
and
its
flamboyant
chairman
and
chief
executive
,
David
L.
Paul
.

In
an
international
buying
spree
that
began
barely
two
years
ago
,
Mr.
Paul
amassed
a
collection
of
about
30
pre-18th-century
works
,
including
the
Preti
,
at
a
total
cost
of
$
28
million
.

By
midnight
Oct.
6
,
all
of
the
paintings
were
supposed
to
have
been
sold
off
,
under
orders
from
Florida
's
comptroller
,
whose
office
regulates
the
state
's
S&Ls
.

CenTrust
did
n't
meet
the
deadline
.

The
collection
was
at
the
heart
of
a
grandiose
plan
Mr.
Paul
had
in
which
the
art
was
to
do
double
duty
--
as
an
investment
for
CenTrust
and
as
decoration
for
the
S&L
's
new
office
tower
,
designed
by
I.M.
Pei
.

The
rub
is
that
the
$
28
million
was
plucked
from
the
funds
of
this
federally
insured
institution
even
as
CenTrust
was
losing
money
hand
over
fist
.

Mr.
Paul
had
no
right
to
buy
art
for
the
S&L
in
the
first
place
--
it
is
n't
on
the
comptroller
's
``
permissible
''
list
--
without
seeking
a
special
dispensation
,
which
he
did
not
do
.

Besides
that
,
some
of
the
paintings
that
were
to
grace
the
walls
of
CenTrust
actually
ended
up
hanging
in
the
chairman
's
estate
on
La
Gorce
Isle
off
Miami
Beach
.

Last
spring
,
the
comptroller
's
office
called
a
halt
to
Mr.
Paul
's
fling
,
giving
him
six
months
to
sell
the
paintings
.

The
acquisitions
,
officials
said
in
a
letter
to
Mr.
Paul
,
were
``
unsafe
,
unsound
and
unauthorized
.

''
So
far
,
Mr.
Paul
has
unloaded
but
three
of
his
masterpieces
,
he
wo
n't
say
to
whom
.

The
comptroller
's
office
says
it
is
``
monitoring
the
situation
.

''
Though
the
agency
could
remove
Mr.
Paul
,
it
has
no
current
intention
to
do
that
.

``
It
's
not
like
selling
Chevrolets
,
''
Mr.
Paul
says
,
as
he
takes
a
drag
on
a
goldbanded
St.
Moritz
cigarette
.

``
The
last
six
months
has
established
the
quality
of
the
collection
.

There
's
no
fire
sale
here
.

''
Despite
Mr.
Paul
's
characteristic
hauteur
,
the
50-year-old
,
chain-smoking
dynamo
is
finding
that
getting
CenTrust
--
Florida
's
largest
thrift
institution
--
out
of
its
riskiest
investments
is
much
tougher
than
getting
into
them
had
been
.

Paintings
are
just
part
of
the
picture
.

Although
Mr.
Paul
has
pared
a
$
1.35
billion
junk-bond
portfolio
to
less
than
$
900
million
since
April
,
the
high-yield
debt
market
has
plummeted
.

Divesting
itself
of
what
is
left
,
as
is
required
of
all
thrift
institutions
by
July
1994
under
the
new
federal
S&L
bailout
law
,
may
well
prove
difficult
.

And
CenTrust
has
other
problems
.

Late
last
week
federal
regulators
ordered
the
thrift
institution
to
stop
paying
dividends
on
its
preferred
stock
--
a
move
that
suggests
deep
concern
about
an
institution
.

Mr.
Paul
has
a
plan
to
bring
in
$
150
million
by
selling
off
63
of
CenTrust
's
71
branches
,
but
it
has
yet
to
be
approved
by
regulators
.

It
is
Mr.
Paul
's
art
venture
,
however
,
that
has
drawn
the
most
attention
from
investors
and
regulators
,
not
to
mention
galleries
throughout
the
world
.

Embittered
shareholders
(
some
of
whom
are
suing
)
say
the
chairman
and
his
collection
epitomize
the
excesses
of
speculation
that
set
off
the
national
S&L
crisis
.

(
CenTrust
shares
have
fallen
sharply
in
price
from
a
high
of
$
15.125
in
1986
to
close
yesterday
at
$
2.875
.

)
Gallery
directors
,
meanwhile
,
say
Mr.
Paul
and
others
of
his
ilk
have
left
an
indelible
mark
on
the
art
world
--
and
not
for
the
better
.

Collectors
do
n't
say
``
It
's
a
van
Gogh
''
anymore
,
laments
Harry
Brooks
,
the
president
of
Wildenstein
&
Co.
,
a
New
York
gallery
.

``
They
say
,
`
Johnny
Payson
got
$
53
million
for
his
,
so
certainly
$
10
million
is
n't
too
much
for
mine
.

'
The
great
collectors
we
depended
on
,
such
as
Paul
Mellon
or
Norton
Simon
,
have
stopped
buying
,
and
the
new
buyers
are
brilliant
men
who
made
money
in
the
stock
market
or
in
takeovers
and
rushed
into
collecting
...
.

''
Mr.
Payson
,
an
art
dealer
and
collector
,
sold
Vincent
van
Gogh
's
``
Irises
''
at
a
Sotheby
's
auction
in
November
1987
to
Australian
businessman
Alan
Bond
.

(
Trouble
is
,
Mr.
Bond
has
yet
to
pay
up
,
and
until
he
does
,
Sotheby
's
has
the
painting
under
lock
and
key
.

)
When
Mr.
Paul
moved
in
on
the
art
market
,
he
let
it
be
known
that
virtually
no
piece
was
too
costly
to
be
considered
by
CenTrust
.

He
established
his
reputation
as
a
freespender
in
January
last
year
at
Sotheby
's
auction
of
the
Linda
and
Gerald
Guterman
collection
in
New
York
.

There
,
on
one
of
his
first
shopping
trips
,
Mr.
Paul
picked
up
several
paintings
at
stunning
prices
.

He
paid
$
2.2
million
,
for
instance
,
for
a
still
life
by
Jan
Jansz.
den
Uyl
that
was
expected
to
fetch
perhaps
$
700,000
.

The
price
paid
was
a
record
for
the
artist
.

(
Some
64
%
of
items
offered
at
the
Guterman
auction
were
sold
,
at
an
average
price
of
$
343,333
.

The
rest
were
withdrawn
for
lack
of
acceptable
bids
.

)
Afterward
,
Mr.
Paul
is
said
by
Mr.
Guterman
to
have
phoned
Mr.
Guterman
,
the
New
York
developer
selling
the
collection
,
and
gloated
.

``
He
says
he
`
stole
them
,
'
''
recalls
Mr.
Guterman
.

``
And
he
tells
me
,
`
If
you
want
to
see
your
paintings
,
you
'll
have
to
come
to
my
house
in
Florida
.

'
''
Mr.
Paul
denies
phoning
and
gloating
.

``
It
's
just
not
true
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Paul
quickly
became
more
aggressive
in
his
collecting
,
with
the
help
of
George
Wachter
,
a
Sotheby
's
expert
in
old
masters
whom
he
met
at
an
exhibition
of
the
Guterman
items
.

Mr.
Wachter
,
who
became
his
principal
adviser
,
searched
galleries
in
London
,
Paris
and
Monaco
.

And
,
according
to
one
dealer
,
Mr.
Wachter
had
a
penchant
for
introducing
Mr.
Paul
with
the
phrase
:
``
He
can
buy
anything
.

''
Nicholas
Hall
,
the
president
of
the
Colnaghi
U.S.A.
Ltd.
gallery
in
New
York
,
sold
Mr.
Paul
``
Abraham
and
Sarah
in
the
Wilderness
''
by
Giovanni
Battista
Tiepolo
.

Mr.
Hall
says
Mr.
Paul
``
was
known
to
spend
a
lot
of
money
.

People
were
interested
in
seeing
him
,
but
it
was
recognized
that
the
route
was
through
Sotheby
's
and
particularly
George
Wachter
.

''
Mr.
Paul
thus
developed
a
close
,
symbiotic
relationship
with
Sotheby
's
.

Mr.
Paul
was
eager
to
assemble
a
collection
for
the
headquarters
CenTrust
has
been
moving
into
for
the
greater
part
of
a
year
.

Sotheby
's
,
the
auction
house
founded
in
London
1744
and
now
under
the
umbrella
of
Sotheby
's
Holdings
Inc.
,
was
hoping
to
stir
up
interest
in
old
masters
as
it
strove
to
build
its
U.S.
business
.

European
dealers
continued
to
dominate
the
action
in
old
masters
,
which
Sotheby
's
North
America
had
lately
been
touting
in
this
country
.

For
several
months
,
there
was
optimism
all
around
.

Last
October
,
Mr.
Paul
paid
out
$
12
million
of
CenTrust
's
cash
--
plus
a
$
1.2
million
commission
--
for
``
Portrait
of
a
Man
as
Mars
.

''
The
painting
,
attributed
to
Flemish
artist
Peter
Paul
Rubens
,
was
purchased
privately
through
Sotheby
's
,
not
at
auction
.

In
March
1989
,
just
15
months
into
his
campaign
,
Mr.
Paul
was
named
by
Art
&
Antiques
magazine
as
one
of
the
top
100
individual
collectors
in
the
U.S
.

``
An
unknown
quantity
to
most
of
the
art
world
,
Paul
is
no
stranger
to
lavish
spending
,
''
the
magazine
said
,
noting
that
he
does
n't
stop
at
paint
on
canvas
but
also
spends
big
on
art
you
can
eat
.

``
He
recently
bid
$
30,000
at
a
Paris
charity
auction
for
a
dinner
cooked
by
six
of
the
world
's
great
chefs
,
but
the
final
party
cost
closer
to
$
100,000
.

''
(
Mr.
Paul
says
it
was
n't
that
high
.

)
The
art
collection
might
have
come
to
rival
the
Medicis
'
had
the
Florida
comptroller
's
office
not
got
wind
of
Mr.
Paul
's
aesthetic
adventure
.

In
its
letter
to
him
,
dated
March
2
and
shared
with
reporters
,
Alex
Hager
,
the
chief
of
the
thrift-institution
bureau
in
the
comptroller
's
office
,
expressed
puzzlement
that
the
S&L
could
be
so
profligate
when
it
had
reported
losses
of
more
than
$
13
million
in
its
two
preceding
quarters
.

The
state
gave
CenTrust
30
days
to
sell
the
Rubens
.

The
comptroller
's
office
eventually
extended
the
deadline
to
six
months
but
broadened
its
demands
,
ordering
that
the
``
book
value
of
the
collection
{
be
}
reduced
to
zero
.

''
In
other
words
:
Get
rid
of
all
the
pictures
.

The
state
obliquely
noted
that
unsafe
banking
practices
are
grounds
for
removing
an
officer
or
director
and
closed
with
the
admonition
to
Mr.
Paul
:
``
Govern
yourself
accordingly
.

''
The
state
agency
was
particularly
vexed
to
learn
that
the
Rubens
and
a
half-dozen
other
paintings
listed
among
the
bank
's
``
furniture
and
fixtures
,
''
were
actually
hanging
in
the
chairman
's
house
.

Mr.
Paul
says
that
at
one
point
he
did
indeed
have
eight
or
nine
of
the
paintings
at
home
and
that
the
rest
were
in
storage
at
Sotheby
's
.

He
explains
that
he
was
``
merely
storing
the
paintings
at
home
--
with
some
display
--
because
of
the
special
dehumidified
environment
''
required
for
their
safekeeping
,
until
CenTrust
's
new
building
was
ready
for
them
.

Still
,
the
incident
was
embarrassing
.

It
came
on
the
heels
of
a
number
of
local
newspaper
articles
suggesting
that
Mr.
Paul
has
benefited
handsomely
from
his
association
with
CenTrust
.

For
instance
,
he
got
a
$
3
million
loan
from
the
S&L
,
negotiated
at
a
below-market
rate
.

He
owns
43
%
of
CenTrust
's
shares
.

Adding
to
Mr.
Paul
's
problems
,
dealers
(
some
with
vested
interests
)
insist
that
he
,
relying
rather
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
advice
,
paid
much
too
much
for
several
pieces
in
the
CenTrust
collection
.

The
$
12
million
lavished
on
the
Rubens
,
for
example
,
was
a
record
price
for
the
artist
and
maybe
twice
its
value
,
given
a
dispute
among
scholars
about
its
provenance
.

David
Tunick
,
the
president
of
David
Tunick
Inc.
,
a
New
York
gallery
,
says
scholars
question
the
authenticity
of
the
Rubens
.

It
may
have
been
painted
instead
by
a
Rubens
associate
.

``
The
feeling
among
many
experts
on
the
commercial
side
is
that
the
price
paid
at
the
time
was
excessive
in
any
event
,
''
Mr.
Tunick
says
.

``
It
sounds
like
with
the
Rubens
he
got
absolutely
taken
to
the
cleaners
.

''
Victor
Wiener
,
the
executive
director
of
the
Appraisers
Association
of
America
,
agrees
that
Mr.
Paul
paid
very
dearly
for
the
Rubens
and
adds
that
getting
rid
of
it
any
time
soon
for
a
similar
sum
would
be
quite
a
feat
.

``
It
's
not
beyond
credibility
the
Rubens
will
someday
be
worth
$
12
million
,
but
whether
it
could
be
sold
for
that
amount
tomorrow
remains
to
be
seen
.

''
Still
,
predicting
is
tricky
.

``
I
'm
forever
dumbfounded
by
what
I
see
making
these
high
prices
.

''
Jonathan
H.
Kress
,
the
son
of
the
painting
's
former
owner
,
Mrs.
Rush
Kress
,
dismisses
the
price
talk
as
``
sour
grapes
.

''
Dealers
contemptuous
of
the
purchase
price
,
he
says
,
were
themselves
interested
in
buying
the
Rubens
but
lost
out
.

Mr.
Paul
,
for
his
part
,
defends
the
Rubens
price
,
saying
a
lot
of
the
experts
have
never
seen
the
thing
itself
.

``
Most
of
them
were
n't
even
born
the
last
time
the
painting
was
displayed
publicly
,
''
he
says
.

Art
prices
are
skyrocketing
,
but
a
good
deal
of
legerdemain
is
involved
in
compiling
statistics
on
sales
.

Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
,
the
investment-banking
firm
,
in
its
annual
tally
of
investment
returns
,
reported
that
old
masters
appreciated
51
%
in
the
year
ended
June
1
,
the
greatest
return
of
any
of
13
assets
it
tracked
.

(
Impressionist
and
modern
paintings
,
not
tracked
by
Salomon
,
are
ranked
even
higher
at
74
%
by
Sotheby
's
.

)
Salomon
,
moreover
,
gets
its
data
on
art
appreciation
from
Sotheby
's
,
whose
prices
go
up
with
clients
like
Mr.
Paul
in
its
thrall
.

The
percentages
omit
from
consideration
the
many
paintings
that
go
begging
at
auction
.

Art
indexes
track
winners
,
not
losers
.

But
art
that
has
fallen
sharply
in
value
is
rarely
put
up
for
sale
.

Also
,
at
any
of
Sotheby
's
auctions
of
old
masters
,
roughly
one-third
to
one-fifth
of
what
is
offered
does
n't
sell
at
any
price
.

It
's
not
that
there
are
n't
any
bids
,
but
the
bids
do
n't
meet
the
minimum
``
reserve
''
prices
set
by
the
sellers
.

In
January
,
the
Preti
painting
that
now
hangs
at
CenTrust
was
expected
to
bring
no
more
than
$
700,000
at
auction
until
Mr.
Paul
came
along
with
his
$
1.15
million
.

Mr.
Hall
of
the
Colnaghi
gallery
says
$
1.15
million
``
would
have
been
an
impossible
price
for
anyone
to
ask
for
a
Preti
four
years
ago
.

''
But
from
his
vantage
point
,
it
is
n't
that
Mr.
Paul
,
a
customer
of
his
too
,
overpaid
for
the
work
,
``
a
gargantuan
painting
by
an
artist
who
is
not
a
household
word
.

''
(
The
painting
is
10
feet
wide
,
seven
feet
high
.

)
Rather
,
``
It
just
shows
things
have
changed
.

''
Mr.
Paul
boasts
that
he
spotted
bargains
in
old
masters
just
before
they
took
an
upward
turn
.

``
They
went
up
51
%
last
year
,
and
they
'll
do
it
again
this
year
,
''
he
declares
.

``
They
were
a
sleeper
.

Everybody
was
out
buying
Monets
.

''
Sotheby
's
vice
president
Diana
Levitt
says
the
auction
house
has
been
``
assisting
''
Mr.
Paul
in
selling
the
paintings
.

And
while
Sotheby
's
chief
rivals
in
the
art
world
,
private
art
dealers
,
``
wo
n't
be
happy
to
hear
it
,
''
she
adds
,
``
a
number
of
{
the
artworks
}
have
already
been
sold
,
and
at
a
substantial
profit
.

''
Mr.
Paul
claims
to
have
sold
three
paintings
,
at
more
than
a
10
%
profit
.

That
is
n't
51
%
,
and
the
claim
is
n't
documented
.

He
furthermore
denies
that
he
relied
too
heavily
on
Sotheby
's
or
Mr.
Wachter
.

Mr.
Paul
says
he
had
not
one
but
four
advisers
and
that
he
never
bid
impulsively
.

After
all
,
he
had
the
counsel
of
``
curators
from
the
most
reputable
museums
in
the
world
.

''
He
says
he
expects
to
sell
the
collection
--
including
the
controversial
Rubens
--
``
carefully
and
prudently
,
just
as
it
was
put
together
.

''
But
in
art-world
parlance
,
Mr.
Paul
's
holdings
are
``
burnt
.

''
That
is
,
he
is
being
compelled
to
put
them
on
the
market
too
soon
,
and
has
already
gotten
offers
that
are
less
than
he
paid
for
some
of
the
art
works
.

``
After
a
few
years
,
you
can
argue
there
has
been
natural
appreciation
,
''
says
Susan
Theran
,
the
publisher
of
Leonard
's
Annual
Price
Index
of
Art
Auctions
.

But
quick
turnover
in
artwork
is
``
like
pawning
your
jewelry
--
you
end
up
with
50
%
.

People
hold
out
and
try
to
get
a
bargain
.

''
Sotheby
's
defends
itself
and
Mr.
Paul
in
the
matter
.

Mr.
Wachter
says
Mr.
Paul
was
a
quick
study
who
worked
intensely
and
bought
the
best
pictures
available
at
the
moment
.

``
On
occasion
,
he
paid
a
high
price
,
''
Mr.
Wachter
concedes
,
but
he
says
those
who
bid
less
and
dropped
out
were
dealers
who
would
then
have
marked
up
the
paintings
to
resell
them
at
a
profit
to
collectors
.

Naomi
Bernhard
Levinson
,
a
fine-arts
appraiser
at
Bernhard
Associates
in
San
Francisco
,
considers
it
``
definite
conflict
of
interest
for
an
auction
house
to
both
advise
a
client
on
purchases
and
to
set
price
estimates
on
the
paintings
to
be
purchased
.

''
Sotheby
's
,
she
says
,
is
``
wearing
both
hats
.

''
``
I
ca
n't
see
why
there
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest
,
''
says
Sotheby
's
Ms.
Levitt
.

``
Estimates
are
based
on
the
previous
price
of
similar
works
sold
at
auction
and
current
market
conditions
,
and
are
not
affected
by
any
knowledge
of
who
the
potential
buyer
could
be
.

''
Frequently
,
clients
express
interest
in
paintings
but
do
n't
end
up
bidding
,
she
adds
,
``
so
we
do
n't
know
who
the
potential
buyer
will
be
.

''
Mr.
Paul
,
in
selling
off
his
paintings
,
is
seeking
at
least
a
15
%
return
on
the
bank
's
investment
,
so
as
to
prove
that
the
venture
was
sound
.

Mr.
Paul
says
that
he
has
feelers
out
over
much
of
the
globe
and
that
potential
buyers
from
as
far
away
as
Japan
and
Italy
have
examined
the
collection
.

Because
of
the
pressure
on
CenTrust
to
sell
,
dealers
and
collectors
have
been
trying
to
get
the
paintings
at
bargain-basement
prices
.

But
so
far
,
Mr.
Paul
and
his
advisers
are
holding
fast
.

One
dealer
,
Martin
Zimet
of
French
&
Co.
in
New
York
,
says
he
``
would
have
loved
to
buy
''
a
Jan
Davids
de
Heem
painting
from
the
bank
.

``
I
tried
to
steal
the
picture
--
to
buy
it
attractively
--
and
{
Sotheby
's
}
would
n't
do
it
.

They
were
protecting
his
interests
.

''
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Paul
and
CenTrust
executives
are
getting
squeamish
about
opulence
.

Mr.
Paul
has
been
characterized
as
``
the
Great
Gatsby
or
something
,
''
complains
Karen
E.
Brinkman
,
an
executive
vice
president
of
CenTrust
.

The
media
,
she
says
,
have
distorted
his
personal
life
.

Mr.
Paul
nods
in
agreement
.

``
I
do
n't
think
I
have
a
life
style
that
is
,
frankly
,
so
flamboyant
,
''
he
says
.

But
at
just
that
moment
,
he
is
interrupted
in
his
office
by
a
servant
in
tuxedo
who
pours
coffee
from
silver
into
a
cup
of
china
and
dabs
the
brim
with
linen
.

Mr.
Paul
says
,
yes
,
the
ceiling
in
his
executive
suite
is
gold-leaf
inlay
.

The
offices
are
done
in
hardwood
and
oriental
rugs
,
leatherbound
books
and
,
of
course
,
a
$
12
million
Rubens
.

But
he
implores
that
the
splendor
be
played
down
.

``
Do
n't
say
it
's
a
gold
ceiling
.

Just
say
the
offices
are
tastefully
appointed
,
''
he
says
.

``
Otherwise
,
the
regulators
will
take
it
for
decadence
,
and
nowadays
everything
's
got
to
be
pristine
.

CREATIVE
ACCOUNTING
,
mostly
by
conglomerates
,
forced
CPAs
to
change
their
way
of
setting
standards
to
be
followed
by
corporations
reporting
financial
results
,
standards
that
had
become
all
too
flexible
.

The
new
Financial
Accounting
Standards
Board
(
FASB
)
was
created
in
1972
to
replace
the
Accounting
Principles
Board
of
the
American
Institute
of
Certified
Public
Accountants
.

All
of
the
former
board
's
members
were
CPAs
,
provoking
conflict-of-interest
criticism
because
they
were
writing
rules
while
handling
clients
'
books
at
the
same
time
.

The
new
board
's
seven-member
structure
kept
four
CPAs
,
but
the
others
were
from
industry
and
academia
.

Francis
M.
Wheat
,
a
former
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
member
,
headed
the
panel
that
had
studied
the
issues
for
a
year
and
proposed
the
FASB
on
March
30
,
1972
.

The
former
board
had
produced
``
21
opinions
and
1,000
critics
''
in
its
12-year
life
,
its
chairman
had
conceded
.

The
climate
was
right
for
the
new
FASB
.

In
the
late
1960s
some
CPAs
failed
to
correct
such
abuses
as
clients
picking
permissive
rules
that
hyped
earnings
and
stock
prices
.

And
in
November
1970
Congress
had
passed
a
special
act
to
overrule
one
board
rule
.

Also
,
James
Needham
,
an
SEC
commissioner
,
in
April
1972
had
warned
that
the
industry
might
face
a
``
federal
agency
writing
accounting
rules
''
if
they
rejected
the
FASB
idea
.

Keepers
of
the
books
,
dubbed
``
figure
filberts
,
''
loathed
the
threat
.

The
FASB
had
its
initial
meeting
on
March
28
,
1973
.

On
Dec.
13
,
1973
,
it
issued
its
first
rule
;
it
required
companies
to
disclose
foreign
currency
translations
in
U.S.
dollars
.

The
FASB
since
then
has
issued
102
rules
,
and
some
still
rile
industry
.

Since
late
1987
,
for
example
,
it
has
put
off
a
rule
dealing
with
deferred
income
taxes
because
of
the
continuing
controversy
over
the
issue
.

CAE

awarded
a
contract
by
the

simulators
,
which
the
company
valued

Reynolds

third-quarter
net

dropped
nearly

million
,
or
$
2.10
a
share
,
from
$
137.2
million
,
or
$
2.56
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
earnings
reflect
an
increase
of
about
5.5
million
in
common
shares
outstanding
.

Revenue
rose
3
%
to
$
1.52
billion
from
$
1.48
billion
.

Reynolds
is
the
third
big
aluminum
company
since
Friday
to
report
disappointing
earnings
.

The
No.
1
domestic
aluminum
producer
,
Aluminum
Co.
of
America
,
Friday
said
its
earnings
fell
3.2
%
to
$
219
million
,
or
$
2.46
a
share
.

And
Alcan
Aluminium
Ltd.
yesterday
reported
net
income
slid
30
%
to
$
180
million
,
or
77
cents
a
share
,
from
$
258
million
,
or
$
1.07
a
share
.

Analysts
on
average
had
been
expecting
about
$
2.70
for
Alcoa
and
$
1
for
Alcan
.

``
It
's
a
good
indication
that
level
of
profitability
has
peaked
for
the
industry
,
''
says
Vahid
Fathi
,
metals
analyst
with
Prescott
,
Ball
&
Turben
Inc.
,
who
had
estimated
Reynolds
would
earn
about
$
2.35
a
share
.

The
nation
's
No.
2
aluminum
company
said
earnings
were
hurt
by
lower
prices
for
certain
fabricated
aluminum
products
,
which
typically
follow
price
fluctuations
of
primary
ingots
.

The
base
metal
price
has
dropped
30.3
%
from
a
year
earlier
to
78
cents
a
pound
.

Much
of
the
price
decline
has
been
blamed
on
a
slowing
economy
and
the
third
quarter
is
typically
the
industry
's
slowest
period
.

But
William
O.
Bourke
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
,
said
the
ingot
price
``
appears
to
have
bottomed
out
.

''
He
said
shipments
are
continuing
at
a
``
healthy
''
pace
and
the
company
has
no
excess
inventory
.

Aluminum
shipments
of
329,600
metric
tons
were
nearly
equal
to
the
year-earlier
period
,
the
company
said
.

Nevertheless
,
the
company
said
that
in
the
latest
quarter
there
were
increased
material
and
labor
costs
,
including
a
new
employee
profit-sharing
plan
.

In
composite
trading

New

Exchange
,
Reynolds
closed
at
$
55.375

up

No
strikeout
,
but
certainly
no
home
run
.

That
's
how
the
stock-picking
game
is
shaping
up
for
the
months
ahead
,
according
to
money
managers
and
a
few
brokers
.

Yesterday
's
88-point
recovery
from
Friday
's
megadrop
in
the
Dow
Jones
industrials
had
many
brokerage
houses
proclaiming
that
stocks
are
a
good
bargain
again
.

But
quite
a
few
money
managers
are
n't
buying
it
.

Weakening
corporate
earnings
,
they
say
,
are
no
prescription
for
a
bull
market
.

``
The
stock
market
ai
n't
going
to
do
much
of
anything
''
for
a
while
,
says
John
Neff
of
Wellington
Management
,
who
runs
the
$
8.3
billion
Windsor
Fund
.

He
suspects
that
Friday
's
market
decline
may
have
a
second
leg
,
perhaps
a
10
%
to
15
%
drop
later
on
.

Mr.
Neff
says
the
stock
market
has
lost
some
powerful
driving
forces
,
namely
earnings
growth
and
the
``
LBO
sweepstakes
''
--
buy-out
fever
that
induced
investors
to
bid
up
whole
groups
of
stocks
,
such
as
media
and
airlines
.

After
sitting
with
20
%
of
his
fund
in
cash
before
Friday
's
sell-off
,
Mr.
Neff
says
he
bought
``
a
narrow
list
of
stocks
''
yesterday
.

With
flat
corporate
profits
on
the
horizon
for
1990
,
money
managers
say
price-earnings
multiples
that
look
cheap
today
might
go
on
being
cheap
for
a
long
time
.

``
This
is
not
a
grossly
overvalued
market
,
but
it
's
not
cheap
either
,
''
says
George
Collins
,
president
of
the
mutual
fund
company
T.
Rowe
Price
Associates
in
Baltimore
.

According
to
Institutional
Brokers
Estimate
System
,
Wall
Street
market
strategists
see
only
a
2.4
%
jump
in
company
profits
in
1990
--
unlike
in
1987
,
when
profits
a
year
out
looked
good
(
they
did
soar
36
%
in
1988
)
.

Bulls
say
the
market
is
an
incredible
bargain
,
priced
at
only
about
12
times
estimated
1989
earnings
for
stocks
in
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
index
.

Before
the
1987
crash
,
the
was
more
than
20
.

The
common
view
,
says
Abby
Cohen
,
strategist
for
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
,
is
that
there
will
be
``
mild
economic
growth
,
modest
profit
expansion
,
and
things
are
going
to
be
hunky-dory
.

Our
view
is
that
we
may
see
a
profit
decline
.

''
Some
think
investors
should
sell
into
rallies
.

The
market
``
is
going
to
wind
down
,
''
says
Gerald
W.
Perritt
,
a
Chicago
money
manager
.

``
Things
are
a
little
less
overpriced
''
after
Friday
's

He
expects
stocks
to
decline
an
additional
5
%
to
30
%
,
with
the
Dow
perhaps
bottoming
out
between
2000
and
2100
``
between
now
and
June

''
After
Friday
's
decline
,
Mr.
Perritt
's
firm
ran
statistical
tests
on
100
high-quality
stocks
,
using
old-fashioned
value
criteria
devised
by
Benjamin
Graham
,
an
analyst
and
author
in
the
1930s
and
1940s
who
is
widely
considered
to
be
the
father
of
modern
securities
analysis
.

He
found
85
still
overvalued
and
15
fairly
valued
.

Nicholas
Parks
,
a
New
York
money
manager
,
expects
the
market
to
decline
about
15
%
.

``
I
've
been
two-thirds
in
cash
since
July
,
and
I
continue
to
think
that
having
a
defensive
position
is
appropriate
,
''
he
says
.

Companies
that
piled
on
debt
in
leveraged
buy-outs
during
the
past
two
years
``
will
continue
to
surface
as
business
problems
.

''
``
Generalizations
about
value
are
n't
useful
,
''
says
New
York
money
manager
John
LeFrere
of
Delta
Capital
Management
.

For
instance
,
he
says
,
International
Business
Machines
and
Unisys
might
look
cheap
,
but
investors
might
continue
to
do
better
with
stocks
like
Walt
Disney
,
Procter
&
Gamble
and
Coca-Cola
,
strong
performers
in
recent
years
.

Money
manager
Robert
Ross
,
head
of
Duncan
Ross
Associates
Ltd.
in
Vancouver
,
British
Columbia
,
says
stocks
would
have
to
fall
15
%
to
20
%
before
they
are
competitive
with
less
risky
investment
alternatives
.

Fredric
Russell
,
a
money
manager
in
Tulsa
,
Okla.
,
says
Friday
's
cave-in
``
is
going
to
have
more
of
a
permanent
impact
on
the
psyche
of
many
investors
than
Wall
Street
would
want
to
admit
.

''
There
are
still
bulls
out
there
.

``
I
still
think
we
will
have
a
3000
Dow
,
whether
it
's
six
months
or
12
months
from
now
I
do
n't
know
,
''
says
David
Dreman
,
managing
partner
of
Dreman
Value
Management
in
New
York
.

``
We
're
doing
a
little
buying
''
in
some
stocks
``
that
have
really
been
smashed
down
.

''
Many
brokerage
house
officials
also
are
optimistic
.

Yesterday
,
Goldman
Sachs
,
Merrill
Lynch
and
Dean
Witter
all
increased
the
proportion
of
assets
they
recommend
investors
commit
to
stocks
.

Dean
Witter
now
recommends
85
%
,
Goldman
65
%
and
Merrill
Lynch
50
%
.

Some
investors
say
Friday
's
sell-off
was
a
good
thing
,
because
it
deflated
a
lot
of
crazy
takeover
speculation
.

``
It
was
a
healthy
cleansing
,
''
says
Michael
Holland
,
who
runs
Salomon
Brothers
Asset
Management
in
New
York
.

From
here
out
,
these
investors
see
a
return
to
old-fashioned
investing
,
based
on
a
company
's
ability
to
show
profit
growth
.

``
The
fundamentals
are
pretty
strong
,
''
Mr.
Dreman
says
.

``
I
do
n't
see
this
as
a
bear
market
at
all
.

It
's
a
recognition
that
there
was
much
too
much
fluff
in
the
LBO
market
.

''
Friday
's
big
fall
was
``
just
a
blunder
by
the
stock
market
,
''
says
John
Connolly
,
chief
strategist
for
Dean
Witter
.

``
It
was
an
overreaction
to
an
event
{
the
failure
of
a
management
and
union
group
to
get
bank
financing
for
a
takeover
of
UAL
}
that
does
n't
mean
that
much
to
lots
of
stocks
.

''
Many
investors
have
nagging
worries
,
however
.

Newspapers
are
full
of
headlines
about
companies
defaulting
on
their
debts
and
banks
writing
off
real
estate
loans
.

That
hurts
investors
'
confidence
in
the
economy
and
stocks
.

Not
even
all
the
brokerage
firms
see
clear
sailing
ahead
.

``
Disappointing
profits
are
likely
to
get
worse
in
the
next
two
quarters
,
''
says
Mary
Farrell
,
a
market
strategist
at
PaineWebber
.

She
thinks
the
market
could
drop
about
10
%
in
the
next
few
months
,
then
recover
and
go
higher
.

Companies
with
steady
earnings
growth
could
do
well
,
she
says
,
while
others
with
high
debt
or
poor
earnings
could
see
their
shares
decline
far
more
than
10
%
.

The
turmoil
on
Wall
Street
may
benefit
some
retailers
attempting
to
lead
leveraged
buy-outs
of
their
specialty
and
department-store
chains
,
investment
bankers
and
retailers
said
.

Managers
at
five
chains
have
said
in
recent
weeks
that
they
intend
to
bid
for
their
companies
.

The
chains
include
Bloomingdale
's
,
owned
by
Campeau
Corp.
,
Toronto
;
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
and
Marshall
Field
's
,
owned
by
B.A.T
Industries
PLC
,
London
;
and
B.
Altman
&
Co.
and
Sakowitz
Inc.
,
owned
by
Hooker
Corp.
,
which
is
now
being
managed
by
a
court-appointed
provisional
liquidator
.

Hooker
is
based
in
Sydney
,
Australia
.

The
combination
of
so
many
chains
available
for
sale
,
the
recent
failures
of
such
retailing
LBO
's
as
Miller
&
Rhoads
Inc.
and
declining
investor
confidence
will
drive
down
prices
,
retailing
observers
said
.

``
The
pricing
will
become
more
realistic
,
which
should
help
management
,
''
said
Bruce
Rosenthal
,
a
New
York
investment
banker
with
Nathan
S.
Jonas
&
Co
.

``
Investors
are
n't
going
to
be
throwing
money
at
any
of
the
proposed
LBOs
,
but
doing
deals
on
the
basis
of
ridiculous
assumptions
never
made
sense
,
either
.

''
Earlier
this
year
,
bankers
and
other
investors
were
willing
to
provide
financing
because
they
assumed
there
would
be
major
gains
in
both
profitability
and
sales
,
Mr.
Rosenthal
added
.

Those
days
are
over
now
,
he
believes
.

``
Competition
from
third
parties
who
have
cash
and
are
prepared
to
buy
has
always
existed
and
will
continue
,
''
added
Mr.
Rosenthal
.

``
But
when
prices
were
crazy
,
it
was
even
harder
to
do
an
LBO
.

Bankers
believed
in
the
greater-fool
theory
that
says
somebody
else
is
always
willing
to
pay
more
.

This
is
no
longer
true
today
.

''
At
Saks
Fifth
Avenue
,
Paul
Leblang
,
senior
vice
president
,
marketing
,
agreed
that
lower
prices
will
help
his
management
team
in
their
proposed
LBO
.

``
Having
to
take
on
less
debt
would
certainly
be
an
advantage
,
''
said
Mr.
Leblang
.

``
It
would
also
help
us
in
our
search
for
equity
partners
.

To
make
an
LBO
work
,
now
we
are
going
to
need
more
than
just
junk
bonds
.

''
None
believe
the
proposed
management
LBOs
will
be
easy
to
complete
,
especially
at
B.
Altman
&
Co.
,
which
is
under
Chapter
11
bankruptcy
protection
.

Not
only
could
the
Wall
Street
gyrations
damp
Christmas
sales
if
consumers
lose
confidence
in
the
economy
,
but
potential
junk-bond
buyers
are
sure
to
demand
even
stronger
covenants
and
greater
management
equity
participation
.

Further
,
many
institutions
today
holding
troubled
retailers
'
debt
securities
will
be
reticent
to
consider
additional
retailing
investments
.

``
It
's
called
bad
money
driving
out
good
money
,
''
said
one
retailing
observer
.

``
Institutions
that
usually
buy
retail
paper
have
to
be
more
concerned
.

''
However
,
the
lower
prices
these
retail
chains
are
now
expected
to
bring
should
make
it
easier
for
managers
to
raise
the
necessary
capital
and
pay
back
the
resulting
debt
.

In
addition
,
the
fall
selling
season
has
generally
been
a
good
one
,
especially
for
those
retailers
dependent
on
apparel
sales
for
the
majority
of
their
revenues
.

``
What
's
encouraging
about
this
is
that
retail
chains
will
be
sold
on
the
basis
of
their
sales
and
earnings
,
not
liquidation
values
,
''
said
Joseph
E.
Brooks
,
chairman
and
chief
executive
officer
of
Ann
Taylor
Inc.
,
a
specialty
chain
.

``
Retailers
who
had
good
track
records
of
producing
profits
will
have
a
better
chance
to
buy
back
their
companies
.

''
Still
,
most
retailing
observers
expect
that
all
the
proposed
retailing
LBOs
will
depend
partly
on
the
sale
of
junk
bonds
,
a
market
already
in
tumult
,
in
part
because
of
concerns
associated
with
bonds
issued
by
the
Federated
and
Allied
units
of
Campeau
.

``
Prices
for
retail
chains
are
lower
today
than
they
were
last
week
,
which
will
help
management
,
''
said
Gilbert
Harrison
,
chairman
of
Financo
Inc.
,
an
investment-banking
firm
specializing
in
retailing
acquisitions
.

``
But
the
hurdle
of
financing
still
has
to
be
resolved
.

Potential
bondholders
will
either
look
for
greater
equity
participation
on
behalf
of
management
,
or
insist
the
equity
component
of
the
deals
be
substantially
greater
than
in
the
past
.

Sony
Corp.
won
a
pretrial
order
blocking
U.S.
sales
of
Justin
Products
Inc.
's
``
My
Own
''
line
of
portable
audio
players
for
children
.

Judge
John
E.
Sprizzo
issued
the
order
in
Manhattan
federal
court
,
where
Sony
has
accused
the
tiny
company
of
illegally
knocking
off
the
``
My
First
Sony
''
line
.

The
judge
held
that
the
combination
of
colors
used
for
the
Sony
products
is
distinctive
and
subject
to
protection
under
New
York
state
law
,
rather
than
federal
law
.

The
legal
fight
was
the
subject
of
a
Wall
Street
Journal
story
yesterday
.

Justin
's
attorney
,
Charles
E.
Baxley
,
said
Justin
would
ask
an
appeals
court
to
set
aside
the
order
temporarily
,
pending
an
expedited
appeal

He
also
repeated
Justin
's
denial
of
Sony
's
charges
.

``
Their
likelihood
of
reversing
us
is
very
slim
,
''
said

CONTINENTAL
MORTGAGE
&
EQUITY
TRUST
said
it
will
resume
dividend
payments
with
a
10-cent-a-share
payout
on
Nov.
6
to
shares
of
record
Oct.
25
.

The
Dallas
real
estate
investment
trust
last
paid
a
dividend
on
Dec.
31
,
1987
,
when
shareholders
received
$
1
a
share
.

Despite
continuing
troubles
with
problem
assets
and
nonperforming
loans
,
the
trust
said
it
expects
to
be
able
to
maintain
or
increase
the
rate
of
distributions
because
of
operations
of
joint-venture
properties
.

A
federal
appeals
court
struck
down
a
natural-gas
regulation
that
had
prevented
pipeline
companies
from
passing
to
customers
part
of
$
1
billion
in
costs
from
controversial
``
take-or-pay
''
contracts
.

The
court
,
in
a
3-0
ruling
,
threw
out
a
deadline
set
by
the
Federal
Energy
Regulatory
Commission
for
settling
old
contract
disputes
over
gas
that
the
pipeline
companies
reserved
but
did
n't
use
.

FERC
's
regulation
had
given
pipelines
until
March
31
,
1989
,
to
pass
on
to
customers
as
much
as
50
%
of
the
costs
of
buying
out
their
broken
contracts
,
which
were
made
with
producers
when
gas
prices
were
high
and
supplies
short
.

A
majority
of
old
contracts
were
renegotiated
by
the
deadline
and
settled
at
steep
discounts
.

But
pipeline
companies
estimate
they
still
face
$
2.4
billion
in
liabilities
from
unresolved
disputes
,
including
$
1
billion
they
fear
they
wo
n't
be
able
to
pass
on
to
customers
.

According
to
industry
lawyers
,
the
ruling
gives
pipeline
companies
an
important
second
chance
to
resolve
remaining
disputes
and
take
advantage
of
the
cost-sharing
mechanism
.

The
court
left
open
whether
FERC
could
reimpose
a
new
deadline
later
.

The
court
,
agreeing
with
pipeline
companies
,
found
the
March
31
deadline
was
``
arbitrary
and
capricious
''
and
``
highly
prejudicial
to
the
bargaining
power
of
pipelines
''
that
were
forced
to
negotiate
settlement
of
the
old
take-or-pay
contracts
to
meet
the
deadline
.

A
report
last
month
by
the
Interstate
Natural
Gas
Association
of
America
found
that
pipelines
'
settlement
costs
had
jumped
in
the
three
months
before
the
deadline
to
39
cents
on
the
dollar
,
from
22
cents
on
the
dollar
in
1988
.

The
court
ordered
FERC
to
justify
within
60
days
not
only
its
cost-sharing
deadline
,
but
other
major
elements
of
its
proposed
regulation
for
introducing
more
competition
into
natural-gas
transportation
.

The
court
also
questioned
a
crediting
mechanism
that
could
be
used
to
resolve
take-or-pay
liabilities
.

The
complex
regulation
,
known
in
the
industry
as
Order
500
,
has
been
hotly
contested
by
all
sides
,
including
natural-gas
producers
,
pipelines
,
local
distribution
companies
and
consumers
.

The
court
's
decision
would
allow
FERC
to
change
some
of
its
provisions
,
but
ensures
it
will
be
reviewed
again
quickly
by
the
court
.

MEDUSA
Corp.
said
it
voluntarily
prepaid
$
7
million
on
its
original
$
75
million
term
loan
,
bringing
the
total
debt
reduction
for
the
year
to
$
18
million
.

After
the
payment
,
the
Cleveland
company
owes
$
57
million
on
the
loan
.

The
cement
producer
said
the
payment
was
made
from
excess
cash
flow
.

NATIONAL
INCOME
REALTY
TRUST
said
it
will
resume
dividend
payments
with
a
12-cent-a-share
dividend
to
be
paid
Nov.
6
to
shares
of
record
Oct.
25
.

The
mortgage
and
equity
real
estate
investment
trust
last
paid
a
dividend
on
Aug.
1
,
1988
,
when
holders
received
75
cents
a
share
.

Despite
continuing
troubles
with
problem
properties
and
nonperforming
loans
,
the
Dallas
trust
said
it
has
rebuilt
reserves
,
abandoned
properties
with
little
potential
and
experienced
improved
operating
results
from
joint
ventures

MLX
Corp.
said
it
reached
a
preliminary
agreement
with
senior
lenders
to
its
refrigeration
and
air-conditioning
group
to
restructure
the
$
188.5
million
of
credit
facilities
the
lenders
provide
to
the
group
.

MLX
,
which
also
makes
aircraft
and
heavy-duty
truck
parts
,
said
the
debt
was
accumulated
during
its
acquisition
of
nine
businesses
that
make
up
the
group
,
the
biggest
portion
of
which
was
related
to
the
1986
purchase
of
a
Hillman
Co.
unit
.

Among
other
things
,
the
restructured
facilities
will
substantially
reduce
the
group
's
required
amortization
of
the
term
loan
portion
of
the
credit
facilities
through
September
1992
,
MLX
said
.

Certain
details
of
the
restructured
facilities
remain
to
be
negotiated
.

The
agreement
is
subject
to
completion
of
a
definitive
amendment
and
appropriate
approvals
.

William
P.
Panny
,

chairman

said
the
pact
``
will

A
battle
is
raging
in
Venice
over
plans
to
have
the
1,200-year-old
Italian
city
be
the
site
for
a
universal
exposition
in
2000
.

The
plans
include

,
floating
trees
,
fanciful
fountains
--
and
as
many
as
60,000
additional
tourists
a

.

Expo
enthusiasts
argue
that
holding
the
fair
would
attract
businesses
,
create
jobs
and
help
renovate
abandoned
sections
of
town
.

But
opponents
fear
overcrowding
.

``
This
city
already
has
too
many
tourists

But
Bogdan
Gumkowski
,

said
the

,
De

also
said
the

participating
,
according
to
the
union
,
while
De
Beers
said
there
were
7,800

.

The
union
has
demanded
a
37.6
%
increase
in
the
minimum
wage
while
De

's
final
offer
was
an
increase
of
17

Bonn
is
convinced
of
the
need
for
cooperation
,
``

said
13,000

said
the
country
's
creditor
banks
are
responding
positively
to
Mexico
's
debt-reduction
package
.

Mr.
Gurria
's
optimism
contrasts
with
some
bankers
'
views
that
the
deal
may
require
a
lot
of
arm
twisting
by
the
U.S.
Treasury
in
order
to
succeed
.

Mr.
Gurria
,
Mexico
's
under-secretary
of
the
ministry
of

,
met
yesterday
with
European
bankers
in
London
,
at
the
half-way
point
on
a
so-called
road

to
market
the
package
around
the
world

An
increasing
number
of
banks
appear
to
be
considering
the
option
under
the
deal
whereby
they
can
swap
their
Mexican
loans
for
30-year
bonds
with
a
face
value
discounted
by
35
%
,
Mr.
Gurria
said
.

The
other
two
options
consist
of
swapping
loans
for
bonds
with
6.25
%
interest
rates
,
or
providing
fresh
loans
.

The
accord

which
covers

Korean
car
exports
have
slid
about
40
%
so
far
this
year
,
but
auto
makers
here
are
n't
panicking
.

They
are
enjoying
domestic
sales
that
are
more
than
making
up
for
lost
overseas
sales
.

South
Korean
consumers
are
expected
to
buy
almost
500,000
passenger
cars
this
year
,
up
60
%
from
1988
.

In
fact
,
some
auto
executives
suggest
that
slackened
demand
for
their
cars
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
is
a
blessing
;
otherwise
they
would
n't
be
able
to
keep
up
with
demand
in
the
more
profitable
local
market
.

``
We
are
very
lucky
to
easily
change
an
export
loss
to
domestic
plus
,
''
says
Hong
Tu
Pyo
,
managing
director
of
domestic
marketing
for
Hyundai
Motor
Co
.

As
it
is
,
waiting
lists
of
a
month
are
n't
unusual
for
popular
models
.

Demand
is
so
strong
that
all
of
the
domestic
makers
--
Hyundai
,
Kia
Motors
Corp.
,
Daewoo
Motor
Co.
and
even
upstart
SsangYong
Motor
Co.
--
plan
to
build
more
factories
.

Industry
analysts
predict
that
by
1995
,
South
Korea
will
be
building
three
million
cars
a
year
--
about
half
of
that
for
export
.

It
's
an
optimistic
move
in
a
industry
already
facing
world-wide
overcapacity
.

But
South
Korean
auto
makers
are
confident
that
the
export
market
will
bounce
back
and
that
demand
in
Korea
will
stay
strong
.

Currently
only
one
in
38
South
Koreans
owns
a
car
,
up
from
one
in
200
a
decade
ago
.

``
In
the
year
2000
it
will
be
one
car
per
family
.

At
that
point
domestic
sales
will
slow
down
,
''
says
Kim
Yoon
Kwon
,
director
of
marketing
for
Daewoo
Motor
.

The
reason
for
the
tremendous
demand
is
simple
:
South
Koreans
suddenly
have
a
lot
more
money
.

``
We
never
thought
we
'd
own
a
car
,
''
says
Kwang
Ok
Kyong
,
who
just
bought
a
Daewoo
LeMans
on
a
five-year
loan
.

She
and
her
husband
started
a
small
printing
business
and
need
the
car
for
work
as
well
as
for
weekend
jaunts
.

Pay
raises
of
60
%
over
the
past
three
years
have
given
many
South
Koreans
the
money
to
enjoy
the
things
they
were
supplying
the
rest
of
the
world
.

The
success
of
newcomer
SsangYong
Motor
shows
the
strength
of
the
auto
market
and
its
growing
diversity
.

A
part
of
the
construction-oriented
conglomerate
SsangYong
Group
,
it
took
over
the
dying
Dong-A
Motor
Co.
in
1986
.

SsangYong
began
making
variations
of
the
Jeep-like
``
Korando
''
vehicle
.

(
Dong-A
had
had
a
technology
agreement
with
Jeep
maker
American
Motors
Corp.
,
now
a
part
of
Chrysler
Corp
.

)
The
most
popular
style
is
the
stretched
``
Family
,
''
which
resembles
a
Ford
Bronco
or
Chevy
Blazer
.

The
four-wheel-drive
vehicles
start
at
$
15,000
;
a
Family
can
cost
over
$
25,000
.

SsangYong
,
which
has
only
about
3
%
of
the
domestic
market
,
will
sell
about
18,000
of
its
models
this
year
,
twice
as
many
as
last
year
.

It
sees
sales
rising
45
%
to
26,000
units
next
year
.

The
company
plans
to
expand
plant
capacity
50
%
by
1991
.

By
then
it
also
hopes
to
begin
producing
a
passenger
car
based
on
the
Volvo
240
and
selling
for
about
$
20,000
.

Hyundai
and
Daewoo
seem
unconcerned
about
the
SsangYong
threat
,
but
Kia
,
the
scrappy
No.3
auto
maker
,
is
selling
four-wheel-drive
vehicles
through
its
Asia
unit
.

It
plans
to
sell
1,700
units
in
1989
.

Kia
,
the
only
Korean
car
maker
that
has
seen
its
overseas
sales
grow
in
1989
,
aims
at
Korea
's
common
man
.

Its
advantage
has
been
the
peppy
little
Pride
,
sold
as
the
Ford
Festiva
in
the
U.S
.

At
3.8
million
won
,
or
$
5,700
,
the
econobox
is
the
lowest-priced
car
in
South
Korea
.

Along
with
two
larger
models
,
the
company
claims
18
%
of
the
domestic
market
.

Ford
Motor
Co.
and
Japan
's
Mazda
Motor
Corp.
have
equity
interests
in
Kia
.

Kia
is
the
most
aggressive
of
the
Korean
Big
Three
in
offering
financing
.

Loans
for
as
long
as
five
years
make
the
cars
very
accessible
,
with
monthly
payments
as
low
as
80,000
won
,
or
$
120
.

Daewoo
Motor
,
a
50-50
joint
venture
with
General
Motors
Corp.
and
the
Daewoo
Group
conglomerate
,
is
the
only
auto
maker
that
appears
to
be
hurting
.

Shipments
of
its
Lemans
to
GM
's
Pontiac
division
are
off
about
65
%
from
a
year
ago
,
versus
a
44
%
decline
for
Hyundai
and
an
18
%
increase
for
Kia
.

Moreover
,
Daewoo
's
domestic
sales
have
grown
half
as
fast
as
sales
of
its
rivals
.

The
big
problem
for
Daewoo
,
which
holds
about
21
%
of
the
market
,
is
the
long
series
of
labor
disruptions
it
suffered
this
year
.

But
Daewoo
is
expanding
too
.

In
fact
,
a
sister
company
,
Daewoo
Shipbuilding
and
Heavy
Machinery
,
plans
to
build
240,000
minicars
by
the
mid-1990s
.

Hyundai
,
the
Korean
market
leader
with
a
58
%
share
,
also
plans
to
jump
into
minicars
at
the
same
time
.

It
has
a
similar
project
for
200,000
cars
a
year
.

Kia
is
reportedly
also
considering
such
a
plan
.

Even
giant
Samsung
Group
is
rumored
in
the
Korean
press
to
be
considering
getting
into
the
auto-making
business
;
a
company
spokesman
had
no
comment
.

Robert
P.
Bulseco
,
44
years
old
,
was
named
president
and
chief
administrative
officer
of
this
regional
commercial
bank
.

Both
posts
had
been
vacant
.

Robert
Robie
,

was
named
to
the
new
positions
of
vice
chairman
and
chief
credit
officer
.

Many
skittish
mutual
fund
investors
picked
up
the
phone
yesterday
,
but
decided
not
to
cash
in
their
chips
after
all
.

As
the
stock
market
bounced
back
,
withdrawals
of
money
from
stock
funds
amounted
to
a
mere
trickle
compared
with
Black
Monday
,
when
investors
dumped
$
2.3
billion
,
or
about
2
%
of
stock-fund
assets
.

Fidelity
Investments
,
the
nation
's
largest
fund
company
,
said
phone
volume
was
more
than
double
its
typical
level
,
but
still
half
that
of
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

Net
outflows
from
Fidelity
's
stock
funds
stood
at
less
than
$
300
million
,
or
below
15
%
of
the
$
2
billion
cash
position
of
the
firm
's
stock
portfolios
.

Much
of
the
money
was
switched
into
the
firm
's
money
market
funds
.

Outflows
since
the
close
of
trading
Friday
remain
below
one-third
their
level
of
two
years
ago
,
Fidelity
said
.

Other
mutual
fund
companies
reported
even
lighter
withdrawal
requests
.

And
some
investors
at
Fidelity
and
elsewhere
even
began
buying
stock
funds
during
the
day
.

,
there
was
a
lot
of
redemption
activity
and
trouble
with
people
getting
through
on
the
phone
,
''
said
Kathryn
McGrath
,
head
of
the
investment
management
division
of
the
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
.

This
time
,
``
We
do
n't
have
that
at
all
.

''
Of
course
,
the
relative
calm
could
be
jolted
if
the
market
plunges
again
.

And
any
strong
surge
in
redemptions
could
force
some
funds
to
dump
stocks
to
raise
cash
,
as
some
did
during
Black
Monday
.

But
funds
generally
are
better
prepared
this
time
around
.

As
a
group
,
their
cash
position
of
10.2
%
of
assets
in
August
--
the
latest
figure
available
--
is
14
%
higher
than
two
years
earlier
.

Many
fund
managers
have
boosted
their
cash
levels
in
recent
weeks
.

The
biggest
flurry
of
investor
activity
came
early
in
the
day
.

Vanguard
Group
Inc.
saw
heavy
exchanges
from
stock
funds
into
money
market
funds
after
the
telephone
lines
opened
at
8:30
a.m
.

``
In
the
first
hour
,
the
real
nervous
folks
came
along
,
''
a
spokesman
said
.

``
But
the
horrendous
pace
of
call
volume
in
the
first
half-hour
slowed
considerably
.

''
At
Scudder
,
Stevens
&
Clark
Inc.
,
phone
calls
came
in
at
40
%
more
than
the
normal
pace
through
early
afternoon
.

Most
of
that
increase
came
in
the
first
hour
after
the
phone
lines
opened
at
8
a.m
.

As
stocks
rose
,
in
fact
,
some
investors
changed
course
and
reversed
their
sell
orders
.

Many
funds
allow
investors
to
void
orders
before
the
close
of
trading
.

At
Scudder
and
at
the
smaller
Ivy
funds
group
in
Hingham
,
Mass.
,
for
instance
,
some
shareholders
called
early
in
the
morning
to
switch
money
from
stock
funds
to
money
market
funds
,
but
later
called
back
to
reverse
the
switches
.

Because
mutual
fund
trades
do
n't
take
effect
until
the
market
close
--
in
this
case
,
at
4
p.m.
--
these
shareholders
effectively
stayed
put
.

At
Fidelity
's
office
in
downtown
Boston
,
Gerald
Sherman
walked
in
shortly
after
7:30
a.m.
and
placed
an
order
to
switch
his
retirement
accounts
out
of
three
stock
funds
and
into
a
money
market
fund
.

But
by
3:15
p.m.
,
with
the
market
comfortably
ahead
for
the
day
,
Mr.
Sherman
was
preparing
to
undo
his
switch
.

``
It
's
a
nice
feeling
to
know
that
things
stabilized
,
''
said
Mr.
Sherman
,
the
51-year-old
co-owner
of
a
discount
department
store
.

But
some
investors
continued
to
switch
out
of
high-risk
,
high-yield
junk
funds
despite
yesterday
's
rebound
from
that
market
's
recent
price
declines
.

Shareholders
have
been
steadily
bailing
out
of
several
big
junk
funds
the
past
several
weeks
as
the
$
200
billion
market
was
jolted
by
a
cash
crunch
at
Campeau
Corp.
and
steadily
declining
prices
.

Much
of
the
money
has
been
switched
into
money
market
funds
,
fund
executives
say
.

Instead
of
selling
bonds
to
meet
redemptions
,
however
,
some
funds
have
borrowed
from
banks
to
meet
withdrawal
requests
.

This
avoids
knocking
down
prices
further
.

The
$
1.1
billion
T.
Rowe
Price
High
Yield
Fund
was
among
the
funds
that
borrowed
during
the
Campeau
crisis
,
says
George
J.
Collins
,
president
of
T.
Rowe
Price
Associates
Inc
.

That
way
,
Mr.
Collins
says
,
``
We
did
n't
have
to
sell
securities
in
a
sloppy
market
.

''
When
the
market
stabilized
,
he
added
,
the
firm
sold
the
bonds
and
quickly
paid
the
loans
back
.

SOFT
CONTACT
LENSES
WON
federal
blessing
on
March
18
,
1971
,
and
quickly
became
eye
openers
for
their
makers
.

The
Food
and
Drug
Administration
that
day
said
Bausch
&
Lomb
could
start
selling
them
in
the
U.S
.

The
cornflake-size
product
was
more
comfortable
and
less
prone
to
falling
out
than
hard
contact
lenses
,
which
had
been
around
since
1939
.

Bausch
&
Lomb
sold
the
softies
under
a
sublicense
from
National
Patent
Development
,
which
had
gained
the
rights
from
the
Czechoslovakia
Academy
of
Sciences
.

Otto
Wichterle
,
a
Czech
,
invented
them
in
1962
.

The
plastic
lens
wraps
itself
over
the
cornea
,
absorbing
eye
moisture
while
permitting
oxygen
to
pass
through
.

But
the
new
lens
became
the
eye
of
a
storm
.

In
September
1971
California
officials
seized
``
bootlegged
''
lenses
--
made
by
unlicensed
companies
--
after
some
showed
traces
of
bacteria
.

In
October
doctors
were
debating
the
product
's
safety
,
some
claiming
it
caused
infections
.

And
there
were
Senate
hearings
on
the
questions
in
July
1972
.

The
product
overcame
the
bad
publicity
and
kept
evolving
.

The
early
soft
lenses
,
which
cost
$
300
a
set
,
were
expected
to
last
for
a
year
.

In
1983
``
extended
wear
''
versions
,
designed
to
be
worn
for
30
days
at
a
time
,
wree
offered
.

Eighteen
months
ago
a
``
disposable
''
seven-day
model
bowed
;
a
year
's
supply
costs
about
$
500
.

Last
month
the
FDA
and
Contact
Lens
Institute
cautioned
users
that
serious
eye
infections
could
result
from
wearing
lenses
more
than
seven
days
at
a
stretch
.

Today
20
million
of
the
25
million
Americans
using
contact
lenses
are
using
the
soft
type
.

Including
the
accesory
eye
care
products
,
contacts
account
for
$
2
billion
in
annual
retail
sales
.

Although
Bausch
remains
the
leader
among
the
six
majors
,
Johnson
&
Johnson
,
with
its
new
disposables
,
is
coming
on
fast
.

The
roller-coaster
stock
market
is
making
life
tougher
for
small
companies
trying
to
raise
money
.

In
the
wake
of
Friday
's
plunge
and
yesterday
's
rebound
,
some
companies
are
already
postponing
deals
,
and
others
wish
they
could
.

As
in
other
jittery
times
,
many
small
businesses
expect
a
particularly
rough
time
raising
funds
as
investors
shun
risky
deals
,
seeking
safety
in
bigger
companies
.

Even
if
stock
prices
fully
recover
from
Friday
's
sharp
decline
,
the
unsettled
conditions
will
frighten
many
investors
.

``
The
implication
of
an
unsettled
situation
is
that
the
thing
could
drop
dramatically
,
''
says
Henry
Linsert
Jr.
,
chairman
of
Martek
Corp.
,
a
four-year-old
biotechnology
company
that
is
planning
a
private
placement
of
stock
.

``
The
more
variables
that
indicate
risk
,
the
more
the
investor
is
going
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
.

''
Earlier
this
month
,
Staples
Inc.
,
a
Newton
,
Mass.
,
office-supplies
discounter
,
said
it
would
accelerate
expansion
plans
nationwide
and
offer
more
of
its
stock
to
the
public
.

At
the
time
,
its
shares
were
selling
above
their
initial
offering
price
of
$
19
,
and
bankers
believed
Staples
would
sell
new
stock
without
a
hitch
.

But
with
the
company
's
shares
standing
at
$
15
yesterday
,
a
new
offering
seems
unlikely
,
company
officials
say
.

Business
,
however
,
continues
to
be
``
robust
,
''
and
the
stock
market
has
n't
affected
the
concern
's
expansion
plans
,
says
Todd
Krasnow
,
a
senior
executive
.

Other
companies
figure
they
ca
n't
avoid
the
market
.

``
We
have
capital
requirements
,
''
says
Mr.
Linsert
,
``
so
we
have
to
go
ahead
''
with
a
planned
$
1.5
billion
private
placement
.

Unless
the
market
goes
right
back
up
,
he
says
,
``
it
may
take
us
six
to
nine
months
to
find
the
money
,
instead
of
three
.

''
And
the
Columbia
,
Md.
,
company
may
have
to
settle
for
a
lower
price
,
he
adds
.

Life
is
particularly
nerve-racking
for
companies
that
had
planned
to
go
public
this
week
.

Hand-holding
is
becoming
an
investment-banking
job
requirement
.

Robertson
,
Stephens
&
Co.
,
a
San
Francisco
investment
banking
concern
,
has
a
client
that
looked
forward
to
making
its
initial
public
offering
yesterday
.

Officers
of
the
company
,
a
health-care
concern
,
``
were
very
discouraged
on
Friday
and
felt
they
should
n't
go
public
;
we
felt
they
should
,
''
says
Sanford
Robertson
,
partner
in
the
banking
concern
.

As
the
market
dropped
Friday
,
Robertson
Stephens
slashed
the
value
of
the
offering
by
7
%
.

Yesterday
,
when
similar
securities
rebounded
,
it
bumped
the
valuation
up
again
.

As
of
late
yesterday
,
the
IPO
was
still
on
.

For
many
,
the
situation
is
especially
discouraging
because
the
market
for
IPOs
was
showing
signs
of
strengthening
after
several
years
of
weakness
.

``
We
were
just
beginning
to
look
at
the
increase
in
IPOs
,
seeing
the
light
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
,
''
says
Frank
Kline
Jr.
,
partner
in
Lambda
Funds
,
a
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
venture
capital
concern
.

``
But
the
tunnel
's
just
gotten
longer
.

''
Companies
planning
to
go
public
``
are
definitely
taking
a
second
look
,
''
says
Allen
Hadhazy
,
senior
analyst
at
the
Institute
for
Econometric
Research
,
Fort
Lauderdale
,
Fla.
,
which
publishes
the
New
Issues
newsletter
on
IPOs
.

He
calculates
that
the
recent
market
slide
translated
into
a
5
%
to
7
%
reduction
in
IPO
proceeds
to
companies
.

Many
companies
are
hesitating
.

Exabyte
Corp.
had
been
planning
to
sell
10
%
of
its
stock
this
week
in
an
IPO
that
would
raise
up
to
$
28.5
million
.

But
now
,
Peter
Behrendt
,
president
,
says
,
``
We
're
making
decisions
on
a
day-to-day
basis
.

''
Debt-free
and
profitable
,
the
Boulder
,
Colo.
,
computer-products
concern
could
borrow
funds
if
it
decides
against
an
IPO
now
,
he
says
.

KnowledgeWare
Inc.
,
an
Atlanta
computer-software
concern
,
says
it
is
still
planning
to
go
ahead
with
its
IPO
this
week
or
next
--
unless
conditions
change
.

``
It
's
a
wait-and-see
situation
right
now
,
''
says
Terry
McGowan
,
president
.

Delayed
financings
also
would
affect
the
operations
of
many
companies
.

Sierra
Tucson
Cos.
,
a
Tucson
,
Ariz.
,
operator
of
addiction-treatment
centers
,
has
a
planned
doubling
of
capacity
riding
on
an
IPO
scheduled
for
next
week
.

William
O'Donnell
,
president
,
says
he
still
thinks
the
IPO
will
succeed
.

If
it
does
n't
,
he
says
,
the
company
would
have
to
change
its
expansion
timetable
.

But
the
market
turmoil
could
be
partially
beneficial
for
some
small
businesses
.

In
a
sagging
market
,
the
Federal
Reserve
System
``
might
flood
the
market
with
funds
,
and
that
should
bring
interest
rates
down
,
''
says
Leonard
T.
Anctil
,
vice
president
of
the
Bank
of
New
England
,
Boston
.

James
G.
Zafris
,
president
of
Danvers
Savings
Bank
,
Danvers
,
Mass.
,
says
the
market
turmoil
``
is
an
absolute
non-event
for
small
business
.

''
For
small
companies
,
he
says
,
interest
rates
are
far
more
important
than
what
happens
on
stock
exchanges
.

Mr.
Zafris
thinks
rates
are
heading
down
,
helping
small
companies
.

Peter
Drake
,
biotechnology
analyst
for
Vector
Securities
International
,
Chicago
,
thinks
market
uncertainty
may
encourage
small
companies
to
form
more
strategic
alliances
with
big
corporations
.

Partly
because
the
1987
market
crash
made
it
harder
for
them
to
find
financing
,
many
high-technology
concerns
have
made
such
alliances
recently
.

Some
even
see
a
silver
lining
in
the
dark
clouds
.

Alan
Wells
,
president
of
Bollinger
,
Wells
,
Lett
&
Co.
,
a
New
York
merger
specialist
,
thinks
panicky
investors
may
lose
their
enthusiasm
for
leveraged
buy-out
and
giant
takeover
deals
.

Instead
,
they
could
turn
to
investing
in
smaller
deals
involving
smaller
companies
,
he
says
.

And
William
E.
Wetzel
Jr.
,
a
University
of
New
Hampshire
management
professor
and
director
of
Venture
Capital
Network
Inc.
,
says
the
market
's
gyrations
will
underline
the
investors
'
lack
of
control
in
big
stock
investments
.

This
will
add
to
the
appeal
of
small
business
,
he
says
,
where
investors
often
have
a
degree
of
influence
.

Bay
Financial
Corp.
,
hurt
by
high
debts
and
deteriorating
real
estate
investments
,
reported
a
wider
loss
for
the
fourth
quarter
and
said
it
might
be
forced
to
seek
a
bankruptcy-court
reorganization
if
it
ca
n't
renegotiate
its
borrowings
.

Bay
said
a
``
substantial
part
''
of
its
debt
outstanding
is
in
default
as
a
result
of
inability
to
sell
certain
properties
quickly
and
lower-than-expected
prices
for
sales
made
.

The
company
said
its
real
estate
portfolio
is
``
highly
leveraged
,
''
while
about
two-thirds
of
its
investments
are
n't
income-producing
.

Thus
it
is
coming
up
short
on
a
big
bet
that
quick
sales
at
higher
prices
would
enable
it
to
keep
up
with
mortgage
and
other
debt
payments
.

According
to
its
latest
annual
report
,
about
a
quarter
of
the
company
's
holdings
are
in
Massachusetts
,
in
the
midst
of
a
real-estate
slump
.

The
company
said
it
had
a
net
loss
in
its
fourth
quarter
ended
June
30
of
$
36.2
million
,
or
$
9.33
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
13.1
million
.

A
year
earlier
,
the
company
had
a
loss
of
$
10.8
million
,
or
$
3.04
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
10.8
million
.

For
the
year
,
it
had
a
net
loss
of
$
62
million
,
or
$
15.97
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
44.3
million
.

In
the
previous
year
,
it
had
a
loss
of
$
22.5
million
,
or
$
6.52
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
41.1
million
.

Although
it
is
having
serious
cash-flow
problems
,
Bay
said
the
fair-market
value
of
its
holdings
,
minus
debt
,
was
equal
to
$
6.02
a
share
at
June
30
based
on
a
recent
appraisal
.

Book
value
per
share
,
which
is
based

,
was
a
negative
$
6.69
a

A

fair-market

was

concern
said
third-quarter
net
was
$
60
million
,
or
98
cents
a
share
,
down
from
$
68
million
,
or
$
1.11
a
share
,
a
year
earlier
.

Share
earnings
are
reported
on
a
fully
diluted
basis
,
by
company
tradition
.

Results
for
the
1988
quarter
included
a
gain
of
$
1.05
a
share
from
sale
of
the
Reda
Pump
and
Oilwell
Cable
units
,
partly
offset
by
a
charge
of
69
cents
a
share
for
recall
of
faulty
truck
steering
systems
.

The
latest
quarter
included
a
gain
of
11
cents
a
share
as
a
partial
reversal
of
the
recall
charge
,
because
the
reserve
established
last
year
exceeded
the
actual
recall
costs
.

Sales
for
the
quarter
rose
8.3
%
to
$
1.79
billion
,
from
$
1.65
billion
,
with
all
three
major
product
groups
reporting
gains
.

The
company
said
aerospace
and
defense
sales
were
up
2
%
for
the
quarter
to
$
802
million
,
and
operating
profit
climbed
6
%
to
$
61
million
,
mainly
because
of
improved
program
performance
in
spacecraft
and
advanced-technology
contracts
.

Automotive
sales
jumped
16
%
to
$
791
million
,
mainly
because
of
higher
sales
of
air
bags
and
other
passenger
restraint
systems
,
TRW
said
.

The
group
had
an
operating
profit
of
$
65
million
,
against
a
loss
of
$
13
million
a
year
earlier
.

However
,
excluding
the
year-earlier
charge
for
recall
of
steering
gear
,
operating
profit
in
the
latest
quarter
declined
14
%
,
reflecting
higher
start-up
and
product
development
expenses
in
passenger-restraint
systems
.

Materials
and
production
costs
also
rose
,
TRW
said
.

The
information
systems
segment
had
a
44
%
jump
sales
to
$
196
million
.

An
acquisition
accounted
for
half
the
sales
rise
,
TRW
said
.

Operating
profit
rose
threefold
to

18
million
,
from
$

For

a
tragicomic
monologue
by
an
idealistic
,
not
unheroic
,
though
sadly
self-deceived
English
butler
in
his
sixties
--
proceeds
as
if
the
realistic
English
novel
of
manners
,
like
Britannia
herself
,
still
ruled
the
waves
.

In
fact
,
Kazuo
Ishiguro
's
``
The
Remains
of
the
Day
''
(
Knopf
,
245
pages
,
$
18.95
)
is
both
an
homage
to
traditional
English
forms
and
a
dramatic
critique
of
them
.

It
implies
that
the
British
Empire
was
rooted
in
its
subjects
'
minds
,
manners
and
morals
,
and
argues
,
tacitly
,
that
its
self-destructive
flaws
were
embodied
in
the
defensive
snobbery
,
willful
blindness
,
role-playing
and
especially
the
locutions
of
its
domestic
servants
.

As
the
narrator
Stevens
,
the
solitary
butler
of
Darlington
Hall
,
mulls
over
such
hallowed
terms
as
``
greatness
,
''
``
dignity
,
''
``
service
''
and
``
loyalty
,
''
we
see
how
pious
cant
subverts
the
soul
.

Stevens
's
dutiful
conflation
of
the
public
and
private
realms
--
like
his
beloved
master
's
--
destroys
all
it
was
designed
to
preserve
.

Such
armor
crushes
the
soldier
.

The
mask
cuts
to
the
quick
.

It
's
1956
,
the
year
the
Suez
crisis
marked
the
final
end
of
Empire
.

As
he
stands
on
a
hill
at
the
beginning
of
a
six-day
motor
expedition
from
Oxfordshire
to
Cornwall
,
where
a
former
housekeeper
resides
,
perhaps
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
20-year
marriage
,
perhaps
(
he
hopes
with
more
fervor
than
he
will
ever
acknowledge
)
not
disinclined
to
return
to
domestic
service
,
Stevens
surveys
the
view
and
thereby
provides
a
self-portrait
,
a
credo
and
the
author
's
metaphor
for
the
aesthetic
of
the
novel
we
're
reading
:
``
We
call
this
land
of
ours
Great
Britain
,
and
there
may
be
those
who
believe
this
a
somewhat
immodest
practice
.

Yet
I
would
venture
that
the
landscape
of
our
country
alone
would
justify
the
use
of
this
lofty
adjective
...
.

It
is
the
very
lack
of
obvious
drama
or
spectacle
that
sets
the
beauty
of
our
land
apart
.

What
is
pertinent
is
the
calmness
of
that
beauty
,
its
sense
of
restraint
.

It
is
as
though
the
land
knows
of
its
own
beauty
,
of
its
own
greatness
,
and
feels
no
need
to
shout
it
.

In
comparison
,
the
sorts
of
sights
offered
in
such
places
as
Africa
and
America
,
though
undoubtedly
very
exciting
,
would
,
I
am
sure
,
strike
the
objective
viewer
as
inferior
on
account
of
their
unseemly
demonstrativeness
.

''
An
effusive
landscape
?
An
ill-mannered
mountain
?
But
let
Stevens
continue
in
his
unwitting
comic
manner
(
his
conscious
efforts
at
``
banter
''
always
fail
--
most
comically
)
:
``
This
whole
question
is
very
akin
to
the
question
that
has
caused
much
debate
in
our
profession
over
the
years
:
what
is
a
`
great
'
butler
?
''
His
answer
is
one
``
possessed
of
a
dignity
in
keeping
with
his
position
.

''
Such
dignity
``
has
to
do
crucially
with
a
butler
's
ability
not
to
abandon
the
professional
being
he
inhabits
.

''
He
``
will
not
be
shaken
out
by
external
events
,
however
surprising
,
alarming
or
vexing
...
.

Continentals
are
unable
to
be
butlers
because
they
are
as
a
breed
incapable
of
the
emotional
restraint
which
only
the
English
race
are
capable
of
.

''
Despite
his
racial
advantage
,
to
be
a
great
butler
is
a
heroic
calling
;
one
's
pantry
is
``
not
unlike
general
's
headquarters
during
a
battle
.

''
If
,
for
example
,
in
the
midst
of
a
great
social
occasion
(
such
as
an
international
conference
on
revising
the
Versailles
Treaty
in
1923
)
,
one
's
72-yearold
father
,
himself
a
great
butler
once
,
should
happen
to
die
of
a
stroke
,
one
must
continue
to
serve
the
port
:
``
Please
do
n't
think
me
unduly
improper
in
not
ascending
to
see
my
father
in
his
deceased
condition
just
at
this
moment
.

You
see
,
I
know
my
father
would
have
wished
me
to
carry
on
just
now
.

''
It
is
this
kind
of
dignity
and
restraint
that
allows
Stevens
to
declare
:
``
For
all
its
sad
associations
,
whenever
I
recall
that
evening
today
,
I
find
I
do
so
with
a
large
sense
of
triumph
.

''
We
note
the
imperial
public
word
used
to
deny
private
rage
and
sorrow
.

That
Stevens
himself
is
not
grotesque
or
repellent
,
but
funny
and
sad
and
enlightening
,
is
entirely
the
author
's
triumph
.

Mr.
Ishiguro
's
ability
to
create
a
fallible
narrative
voice
that
permits
him
to
explore
such
intertwining
domestic
,
cultural
and
political
themes
was
abundantly
clear
in
his
previous
novel
,
``
An
Artist
of
the
Floating
World
,
''
set
in
Japan
after
the
war
.

Now
shifting
his
scene
from
the
country
he
left
at
five
to
the
England
he
has
lived
in
for
nearly
30
years
,
he
has
fashioned
a
novel
in
the
mode
of
Henry
James
and
E.M.
Forster
.

With
great
aplomb
he
considers
not
only
filial
devotion
and
(
utterly
repressed
)
sexual
love
,
but
British
anti-Semitism
,
the
gentry
's
impatience
with
democracy
and
support
of
Hitler
,
and
the
moral
problematics
of
loyalty
:
``
It
is
,
in
practice
,
simply
not
possible
to
adopt
such
a
critical
attitude
towards
an
employer
and
at
the
same
time
provide
good
service
...
.

`
This
employer
embodies
all
that
I
find
noble
and
admirable
.

I
will
hereafter
devote
myself
to
serving
him
.

'
This
is
loyalty
intelligently
bestowed
.

''
In
the
end
,
after
meeting
with
the
former
housekeeper
,
Stevens
sits
by
the
seashore
at
dusk
,
thinking
of
her
and
of
his
employer
,
and
declares
``
I
trusted
.

I
trusted
in
his
lordship
's
wisdom
...
.

I
ca
n't
even
say
I
made
my
own
mistakes
.

Really
--
one
has
to
ask
oneself
--
what
dignity
is
there
in
that
?
''
The
loyal
servant
has
come
full
circle
.

What
is
greatness
?
What
is
dignity
?
We
understand
such
rueful
wisdom
must
be
retrospective
:
The
owl
of
Minerva
only
spreads
her
wings
at
dusk
.

But
as
``
The
Remains
of
the
Day
''
so
eloquently
demonstrates
with
quiet
virtuosity
,
such
wisdom
can
be
movingly
embodied
in
art
.

Mr.
Locke
teaches
English
and
comparative
literature
at
Columbia
University
.

UGI
Corp.
said
its
AmeriGas
subsidiary
completed
the
previously
announced
sale
of
its
air
separation
plant
and
related
assets
in
Waukesha
,
Wis.
,
to
AGA
Gas
Inc.
,
Cleveland
.

The
price
was
n't
disclosed
.

The
transaction
is
part
of
UGI
's
continuing
program
to
shed
AmeriGas
's
industrial
gas
interests
and
expand
the
subsidiary
's
propane
business
.

Since
June
,
AmeriGas
has
netted
more
than
$
100
million
from
industrial
gas
divestitures
and
reinvested
more
than
$
50
million
to
acquire
three
propane
distributors
.

UGI
is
a
gas
and
electric
utility
and
distributes
propane
nationally
through
its
AmeriGas
subsidiary
.

Stanislav
Ovcharenko
,
who
represents
the
Soviet
airline
Aeroflot
here
,
has
some
visions
that
are
wild
even
by
the
current
standards
of
perestroika
.

In
his
office
overlooking
the
runway
of
Shannon
Airport
,
Mr.
Ovcharenko
enthusiastically
throws
out
what
he
calls
``
just
ideas
''
:
First
,
he
suggests
,
GPA
Group
Ltd.
,
the
international
aircraft
leasing
company
based
in
Ireland
,
could
lease
some
of
its
Boeing
jetliners
to
the
Soviet
airline
.

Then
Aer
Lingus
,
the
Irish
flag
carrier
,
could
teach
Aeroflot
pilots
to
fly
the
Boeings
,
and
the
fleet
could
be
based
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.

That
's
not
all
,
he
says
.

Aer
Rianta
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
could
build
a
cargo
terminal
in
the
Soviet
Union
.

Aeroflot
could
lease
some
of
its
cargo
planes
to
Aer
Lingus
,
through
GPA
,
for
a
joint-venture
cargo
airline
.

And
then
there
is
his
notion
of
an
Irish-Soviet
charter
airline
to
ferry
Armenians
to
Los
Angeles
via
Shannon
.

Have
the
freedoms
of
glasnost
gone
to
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
head
?
Hardly
.

The
Irish-Soviet
aviation
connection
is
alive
and
well
here
at
Shannon
Airport
.

GPA
is
indeed
talking
about
leasing
Western
planes
to
Aeroflot
and
even
about
buying
Soviet-built
Tupolev
204s
.

Aer
Lingus
is
in
discussions
with
the
Soviet
carrier
about
a
cargo
venture
and
other
possibilities
.

Aer
Rianta
already
has
so
many
ventures
with
Aeroflot
that
its
chief
executive
is
studying
Russian
.

Unlikely
as
it
may
seem
,
tiny
,
politically
neutral
Ireland
has
penetrated
the
mighty
Soviet
airline
bureaucracy
.

And
as
Aeroflot
struggles
to
boost
its
service
standards
,
upgrade
its
fleet
and
pursue
commercial
opportunities
,
the
Irish
aviation
industry
seems
poised
to
benefit
.

``
Irish
and
Soviet
people
are
similar
,
''
says
Mr.
Ovcharenko
.

``
They
look
the
same
.

They
're
very
friendly
.

''
Moreover
,
he
says
,
Irish
companies
are
small
but
spunky
.

``
We
have
to
study
their
experience
very
well
,
''
he
says
.

``
We
must
find
any
way
to
get
business
.

''
The
two
groups
have
been
working
together
since
the
late
1970s
,
long
before
Soviet
joint
ventures
were
the
rage
in
the
West
.

Aeroflot
carried
about
125
million
passengers
last
year
,
and
Shannon
Airport
,
the
airline
's
largest
transit
airport
outside
the
Soviet
Union
,
saw
1,400
Aeroflot
flights
and
250,000
passengers
pass
through
.

An
apartment
complex
down
the
road
is
the
crew-rest
and
staging
area
for
more
than
130
Aeroflot
pilots
and
flight
attendants
.

The
airport
's
biggest
supplier
of
aircraft
fuel
is
the
Soviet
Union
.

Tankers
from
the
Latvian
port
of
Ventspils
each
year
unload
25
million
gallons
of
fuel
into
a
special
tank
farm
at
the
airport
.

What
Aeroflot
does
n't
pour
into
its
own
gas-guzzling
Ilyushins
is
bartered
to
the
airport
authority
,
which
resells
it
to
11
Western
carriers
including
Air
France
,
Trans
World
Airlines
and
Pakistan
International
Airlines
.

Aeroflot
thus
pays
its
landing
fees
,
ground-handling
and
catering
bills
with
fuel
,
preserving
its
hard
currency
.

That
is
n't
all
.

Last
year
,
the
Irish
airport
authority
,
in
a
joint
venture
with
Aeroflot
,
opened
four
hard-currency
duty-free
shops
at
Moscow
's
Sheremetyevo
Airport
.

Aer
Rianta
now
manages
duty-free
sales
on
all
Aeroflot
international
flights
out
of
Moscow
.

Duty-free
shops
in
Leningrad
's
Pulkova
Airport
opened
in
July
,
and
hard-currency
shops
in
Leningrad
hotels
and
on
the
Soviet-Finnish
frontier
are
coming
soon
.

Aer
Rianta
is
talking
about
similar
joint
ventures
in
Tashkent
and
in
Sochi
,
a
Black
Sea
resort
,
and
even
has
a
computer-assembly
project
cooking
with
the
Georgian
city
of
Tbilisi
.

Aeroflot
's
international
fleet
of
285
planes
is
being
repainted
and
refurbished
at
Shannon
Airport
.

Thanks
to
a
new
air-traffic
agreement
and
the
ability
of
Irish
travel
agents
to
issue
Aeroflot
tickets
,
tourists
here
are
taking
advantage
of
Aeroflot
's
reasonable
prices
to
board
flights
in
Shannon
for
holidays
in
Havana
,
Kingston
and
Mexico
City
.

The
round-trip
fare
to
Havana
is
410
Irish
punts
(
$
578
)
.

Jamaica
costs
504
punts
.

A
formal
blessing
of
sorts
was
bestowed
on
this
friendship
in
April
when
Mikhail
and
Raisa
Gorbachev
stopped
here
for
talks
with
Irish
Prime
Minister
Charles
Haughey
.

New
trade
accords
were
signed
.

It
all
started
with
geography
.

When
it
opened
in
1939
,
Shannon
was
the
first
landfall
in
Europe
for
thirsty
airplanes
flying
from
North
America
.

Advances
in
aircraft
fuel
efficiency
over
the
years
made
a
Shannon
stop
unnecessary
for
most
Western
air
fleets
,
but
Aeroflot
still
flies
inefficient
Ilyushins
that
ca
n't
make
it
from
Moscow
to
Managua
on
one
hop
.

As
a
result
,
Ireland
did
n't
spurn
the
Soviets
after
they
shot
down
a
Korean
Air
Lines
jetliner
over
the
Sea
of
Japan
in
1983
,
though
it
suspended
direct
Moscow-Shannon
flights
for
two
months
.

In
fact
,
Aer
Lingus
started
ferrying
Russians
from
Shannon
to
New
York
when
Washington
stripped
Aeroflot
of
its
U.S.
landing
rights
.

Today
,
Aer
Rianta
is
making
a
heap
of
money
from
its
Soviet
friendship
.

And
,
with
those
contacts
in
place
,
it
could
be
relatively
simple
to
add
Aer
Lingus
and
GPA
to
the
team
.

Then
,
perhaps
,
Mr.
Ovcharenko
's
ideas
would
n't
sound
like
so
much
blarney
.

Britain
's
industrial
production
rose
1.5
%
in
August
from
July
and
was
up
0.9
%
from
August
1988
,
according
to
provisional
data
from
the
Central
Statistical
Office
.

Output
in
the
energy
sector
,
which
can
vary
greatly
with
swings
in
the
oil
market
,
rose
3.8
%
in
August
from
May
but
was
down
7.1
%
from
a
year
earlier
.

The
latest
figures
compare
with
July
's
4.5
%
month-to-month
rise
and
11.3
%
year-to-year
fall
.

When
Nucor
Corp.
begins
shipping
steel
from
the
world
's
first
thin-slab
plant
this
month
,
it
will
begin
testing
the
competitive
mettle
of
its
giant
competitors
.

The
new
technology
,
which
creates
a
very
thin
piece
of
steel
,
radically
reduces
the
costs
of
making
flat-rolled
sheets
.

An
ebullient
Kenneth
Iverson
,
Nucor
's
chairman
,
says
the
company
's
plant
eventually
will
make
a
ton
of
steel
in
1.5
man
hours
,
compared
with
four
to
six
man
hours
at
a
conventional
mill
.

``
We
've
had
the
Russians
and
Chinese
,
and
people
from
India
visiting
us
,
''
Mr.
Iverson
beams
.

``
Everyone
in
the
world
is
watching
us
very
closely
.

''
Especially
his
neighbors
,
the
major
U.S.
steelmakers
.

Already
,
USX
Corp.
and
Armco
Inc.
are
studying
Nucor
's
technology
to
see
if
they
can
adopt
it
.

Says
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
major
Midwest
steel
company
:
``
It
's
damn
worrisome
.

''
The
once-staid
steel
industry
is
about
to
be
turned
topsy-turvy
by
a
1990s
technology
revolution
.

New
,
efficient
and
sophisticated
processes
make
it
easier
for
smaller
,
less
cash-rich
companies
to
make
steel
at
a
fraction
of
what
Big
Steel
paid
decades
ago
.

It
also
enables
minimills
finally
to
get
a
toehold
in
the
flat-rolled
steel
market
--
the
major
steelmakers
'
largest
,
most
prized
,
and
until
now
,
untouchable
,
market
.

But
such
thin-slab
technology
is
only
the
beginning
.

Eager
engineers
espouse
direct-steelmaking
and
direct
casting
,
which
by
the
end
of
the
1990s
will
enable
production
without
coke
ovens
and
blast
furnaces
.

Those
massive
structures
,
while
posing
cost
and
environmental
headaches
,
effectively
locked
out
all
but
deep-pocketed
giants
from
steelmaking
.

``
There
's
a
revolution
ahead
of
us
that
will
ultimately
change
the
way
we
market
and
distribute
steel
,
''
says
William
Dennis
,
vice
president
,
manufacturing
and
technology
,
for
the
American
Iron
Ore
and
Steel
Institute
.

It
is
n't
that
major
steelmakers
have
blithely
ignored
high
technology
.

In
fact
,
they
've
spent
billions
of
dollars
to
boost
the
percentage
of
continously
cast
steel
to
60.9
%
in
1988
,
from
39.6
%
five
years
before
.

Moreover
,
their
balance
sheets
are
rich
with
diversity
,
their
old
plants
shuttered
,
and
work
forces
lean
.

But
that
wo
n't
suffice
.

``
It
's
no
longer
enough
to
beat
the
guy
down
the
street
.

You
have
to
beat
everyone
around
the
world
,
''
says
Mr.
Dennis
.

He
wants
to
see
steelmakers
more
involved
in
computers
and
artificial
intelligence
.

The
problem
:
They
're
saddled
with
huge
plants
that
require
costly
maintenance
.

And
try
plying
new
dollars
free
in
a
market
that
is
softening
,
hurt
by
a
strong
dollar
and
concerned
about
overcapacity
--
the
industry
's
Darth
Vadar
.

``
The
technology
revolution
is
going
to
be
very
threatening
to
established
producers
,
''
says
Peter
Marcus
,
an
analyst
with
PaineWebber
Inc
.

``
They
've
got
too
much
invested
in
the
old
stuff
and
they
ca
n't
get
their
workers
to
be
flexible
.

''
No
one
expects
minimills
to
eclipse
major
integrated
steelmakers
,
who
remain
the
undisputed
kings
of
highest-quality
steel
used
for
autos
and
refrigerators
.

Nucor
's
plant
in
Crawfordsville
,
Ind.
,
ultimately
will
produce
only
one
million
tons
annually
,
a
drop
in
the
40-million-ton-a-year
flat-rolled
steel
bucket
,
and
it
will
be
years
before
such
plants
can
compete
in
the
high-profit
market
.

Still
,
flat-rolled
is
the
steel
industry
's
bread
and
butter
,
representing
about
half
of
the
80
million
tons
of
steel
expected
to
be
shipped
this
year
.

Moreover
,
the
process
is
n't
without
its
headaches
.

Because
all
operations
are
connected
,
one
equipment
failure
forces
a
complete
plant
shutdown
.

On
some
days
,
the
Nucor
plant
does
n't
produce
anything
.

``
At
this
point
,
the
minimill
capacity
wo
n't
make
a
great
dent
in
the
integrated
market
,
but
it
does
challenge
them
to
develop
new
markets
,
''
says
James
McCall
,
vice
president
,
materials
,
at
Battelle
,
a
technology
and
management-research
giant
based
in
Columbus
,
Ohio
.

Indeed
,
with
demand
for
steel
not
growing
fast
enough
to
absorb
capacity
,
steelmakers
will
have
to
change
the
way
they
do
business
.

In
the
past
,
says
Armco
's
chief
economist
John
Corey
,
steelmakers
made
a
product
and
set
it
out
on
the
loading
dock
.

``
We
said
:
`
We
've
got
a
product
:
if
you
want
it
,
you
can
buy
it
,
'
''
he
says
,
adding
:
``
Now
we
're
figuring
out
what
people
need
,
and
are
going
back
to
make
it
.

''
Armco
's
sales
representatives
visit
the
General
Motors
Corp.
's
Fairfax
assembly
plant
in
Kansas
City
,
Mo.
,
two
or
three
days
a
week
.

When
they
determined
that
GM
needed
parts
more
quickly
,
Armco
convinced
a
steel
service
center
to
build
a
processing
plant
nearby
so
shipments
could
be
delivered
within
15
minutes
.

Cementing
such
relationships
with
major
clients
--
car
and
appliance
makers
--
is
a
means
of
survival
,
especially
when
those
key
clients
are
relying
on
a
smaller
pool
of
producers
and
flirting
with
plastic
and
aluminum
makers
.

For
example
,
when
Detroit
began
talking
about
plastic-bodied
cars
,
the
American
Iron
and
Steel
Institute
began
a
major
lobbying
effort
to
show
auto
makers
how
they
could
use
steel
more
efficiently
by
simply
redesigning
how
a
car
door
is
assembled
.

But
steelmakers
must
also
find
new
markets
.

After
letting
aluminum-makers
take
the
recycling
lead
,
a
group
of
the
nation
's
largest
steelmakers
started
a
recycling
institute
to
promote
steel
cans
to
an
environmentally
conscious
nation
.

Battelle
's
Mr.
McCall
thinks
steelmakers
should
concentrate
more
on
construction
.

Weirton
Steel
Corp.
,
Weirton
,
W.
Va.
,
for
example
,
is
touting
to
homeowners
fashionable
steel
doors
,
with
leaded
glass
inserts
,
as
a
secure
and
energy-efficient
alternative
to
wooden
or
aluminum
ones
.

Other
steelmakers
envision
steel
roofs
covering
suburbia
.

Still
others
are
looking
at
overseas
markets
.

USX
is
funneling
drilling
pipe
to
steel-hungry
Soviet
Union
.

This
year
,
the
nation
's
largest
steelmaker
reactivated
its
overseas
sales
operation
.

Producers
also
are
trying
to
differentiate
by
concentrating
on
higher-profit
output
,
such
as
coated
and
electrogalvanized
products
,
which
remain
beyond
the
reach
of
minimills
.

Almost
all
capital-improvement
programs
announced
by
major
steelmakers
within
the
past
year
involve
building
electrogalvanizing
lines
,
used
to
produce
steel
for
such
products
as
household
appliances
and
car
doors
.

But
unfortunately
,
that
segment
is
much
smaller
than
the
bread-and-butter
flat-rolled
steel
.

``
It
's
like
everyone
climbing
out
of
the
QE
II
and
getting
into
a
lifeboat
,
''
says
John
Jacobson
,
an
analyst
with
AUS
Consultants
.

``
After
a
while
,
someone
has
to
go
over
the
side
.

''
Although
he
does
n't
expect
any
bankruptcies
,
he
does
see
more
plants
being
sold
or
closed
.

Robert
Crandall
,
with
the
Brookings
Institute
,
agrees
.

``
Unless
there
is
an
enormous
rate
of
economic
growth
or
a
further
drop
in
the
dollar
,
it
's
unlikely
that
consumption
of
U.S.
produced
steel
will
grow
sufficiently
to
offset
the
growth
of
minimills
.

''
Not
to
mention
the
incursion
of
imports
.

Japanese
and
European
steelmakers
,
which
have
led
the
recent
technology
developments
,
are
anxiously
awaiting
the
lifting
of
trade
restraints
in
1992
.

Moreover
,
the
U.S.
can
expect
more
competition
from
low-cost
producing
Pacific
Rim
and
Latin
American
countries
.

A
Taiwanese
steelmaker
recently
announced
plans
to
build
a
Nucor-like
plant
.

``
People
think
of
the
steel
business
as
an
old
and
mundane
smokestack
business
,
''
says
Mr.
Iverson
.

``
They
're
dead
wrong
.

WEFA
Group
Polaroid
Corp.
's
patent-infringement
damages
case
against
Eastman
Kodak
Co.
,
one
of
the
highest
stakes
corporate
trials
ever
,
is
getting
scant
attention
on
Wall
Street
.

After
78
days
of
mind-numbing
testimony
in
federal
court
in
Boston
,
the
trial
is
being
all
but
ignored
by
analysts
and
patent
attorneys
.

Most
have
read
the
pre-trial
documents
,
however
,
and
estimate
Kodak
will
be
ordered
to
pay
$
1
billion
to
$
1.5
billion
for
infringing
on
seven
Polaroid
patents
.

That
may
be
the
largest
patent
award
ever
,
but
it
is
well
below
the
$
12
billion
Polaroid
seeks
.

The
highest
patent
damage
award
to
date
was
in
1986
,
when
Smith
International
Inc.
was
ordered
to
pay
$
205
million
to
Baker
Hughes
Inc.
for
infringing
on
a
patent
on
an
oil
drilling
bit
seal
.

The
two
companies
later
agreed
to
settle
for
$
95
million
.

Few
analysts
think
it
is
worth
their
time
to
slog
through
the
Polaroid
trial
testimony
.

``
It
's
like
panning
for
gold
outside
of
Grand
Central
Station
.

You
might
find
something
,
but
the
chances
are
low
,
''
said
Michael
Ellman
,
an
analyst
at
Wertheim
Schroder
&
Co
.

And
Eugene
Glazer
,
an
analyst
at
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
Inc.
,
said
:
``
If
you
hired
an
attorney
to
be
there
all
the
time
and
give
you
a
(
prediction
)
of
the
eventual
award
,
I
would
be
willing
to
bet
that
he
would
be
off
''
by
a
lot
.

A
75-day
trial
in
the
early
1980s
determined
that
Kodak
,
based
in
Rochester
,
N.Y.
,
infringed
on
patents
of
Polaroid
,
of
Cambridge
,
Mass
.

The
main
issues
remaining
are
how
to
calculate
damages
and
whether
the
infringement
was
``
willful
and
deliberate
.

''
If
so
,
the
damages
could
be
tripled
.

Two
analysts
who
have
read
the
transcripts
,
David
Nelson
of
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc.
and
Calvert
D.
Crary
,
a
litigation
analyst
at
Labe
,
Simpson
&
Co.
,
think
Judge
A.
David
Mazzone
will
decide
in
Kodak
's
favor
on
the
``
willful
and
deliberate
''
issue
.

Mr.
Crary
said
testimony
by
Kodak
's
patent
counsel
,
Francis
T.
Carr
of
Kenyon
&
Kenyon
,
showed
that
``
he
worked
with
Kodak
continuously
from
the
outset
of
the
project
''
in
an
effort
to
avoid
infringement
.

``
Carr
told
Kodak
on
many
occasions
to
avoid
various
features
because
of
Polaroid
's
patent
positions
,
''
and
Kodak
followed
his
advice
in
every
instance
,
Mr.
Crary
said
.

But
Irving
Kayton
,
a
patent
expert
at
George
Mason
University
School
of
Law
who
is
familiar
with
the
case
,
said
the
fact
that
seven
patents
were
infringed
``
suggests
that
infringement
was
willful
.

It
's
difficult
to
be
that
consistently
wrong
.

''
Observers
also
wonder
whether
Judge
Mazzone
will
use
the
lost-profits
method
of
determining
damages
,
which
Polaroid
favors
because
it
would
result
in
a
larger
award
,
or
the
reasonable
royalty
method
.

Polaroid
claims
it
could
have
manufactured
and
sold
all
the
instant
cameras
and
film
sold
by
Kodak
if
Kodak
had
n't
entered
the
market
.

Moreover
,
Polaroid
contends
it
could
have
sold
them
at
a
higher
price
--
and
thus
made
higher
profits
--
because
it
would
n't
have
been
forced
to
match
Kodak
's
lower
prices
.

Each
side
has
called
a
Harvard
Business
School
professor
to
testify
on
that
issue
.

Kodak
hired
Robert
Buzzell
and
Polaroid
brought
in
Robert
J.
Dolan
.

``
There
's
nothing
that
says
that
people
at
Harvard
Business
school
have
to
agree
with
each
other
,
''
said
Mr.
Buzzell
.

Testimony
is
expected
to
continue
until
early
December
.

A
decision
is
n't
expected
until
some
time
next
year
.

International
Business
Machines
Corp.
said
earnings
tumbled
30
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
even
a
bit
further
than
expected
,
rendering
the
outlook
doubtful
for
the
next
few
quarters
.

The
main
reason
was
a
delay
in
shipment
of
new
high-end
disk
drives
,
a
business
that
accounts
for
some
10
%
of
IBM
's
$
60
billion
of
annual
revenue
.

IBM
,
which
telegraphed
the
poor
results
three
weeks
ago
,
also
cited
an
increase
in
its
leasing
business
,
which
tends
to
lock
in
business
long-term
but
cut
revenue
in
the
near
term
.

In
addition
,
IBM
noted
that
the
stronger
dollar
has
cut
the
value
of
overseas
revenue
and
earnings
when
they
are
translated
into
dollars
.

Earnings
fell
to
$
877
million
,
or
$
1.51
a
share
,
somewhat
below
securities
analysts
'
revised
expectations
of
around
$
1.60
a
share
.

That
compared
with
the
year-earlier
$
1.25
billion
,
or
$
2.10
a
share
--
which
was
inflated
by
a
15-cents-a-share
gain
from
the
sale
of
some
MCI
Communications
Corp.
stock
and
by
an
unspecified
amount
from
a
payment
by
Fujitsu
Ltd.
relating
to
a
software
dispute
.

Revenue
climbed
4.3
%
to
$
14.31
billion
from
$
13.71
billion
.

IBM
,
Armonk
,
N.Y.
,
remained
upbeat
.

The
computer
giant
,
whose
U.S.
results
have
been
dismal
for
years
,
noted
that
revenue
rose
again
in
the
U.S.
in
the
third
quarter
,
following
an
increase
in
the
second
period
.

The
company
said
in
a
statement
that
``
demand
for
IBM
products
and
services
continues
to
be
good
world-wide
.

We
do
not
see
anything
in
the
fundamentals
of
our
business
that
would
cause
us
to
change
our
strategy
of
investing
for
profitable
growth
.

''
Securities
analysts
,
however
,
remained
downbeat
.

``
I
think
1990
will
be
another
mediocre
year
,
''
said
Steve
Milunovich
of
First
Boston
.

Jay
Stevens
of
Dean
Witter
actually
cut
his
per-share
earnings
estimate
to
$
9
from
$
9.50
for
1989
and
to
$
9.50
from
$
10.35
in
1990
because
he
decided
sales
would
be
even
weaker
than
he
had
expected
.

Both
estimates
would
mark
declines
from
the
1988
net
of
$
5.81
billion
,
or
$
9.80
a
share
,
which
itself
was
well
below
the
record
IBM
set
in
1984
.

Mr.
Stevens
said
he
kept
a
``
''
recommendation
on
the
stock
only
because
``
all
the
damage
has
been
done
.

''
He
said
the
stock
has
n't
traded
below
1
times
book
value
over
the
past
10
years
,
which
at
the
moment
computes
to
a
stock
price
of
$
100
.

The
stock
closed
yesterday
at
$
103
a
share
,
up
just
$
1
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
as
the
market
surged
.

Analysts
worry
that
the
disk-drive
and
leasing
problems
will
last
at
least
through
the
first
quarter
.

``
A
key
part
of
the
question
is
,
how
soon
does
this
disk-drive
come
and
how
soon
does
production
ramp
up
?
''
said
Steve
Cohen
at
SoundView
Financial
Group
.

``
And
the
input
I
've
had
from
customers
is
that
it
still
could
be
a
while

On
leasing
,
Bob
Djurdjevic
at
Annex
Research
said
he
thinks
IBM
has
hurt
itself
unnecessarily
.

He
said
IBM
has
priced
its
leases
aggressively
,
thinking
that
would
help
win
business
.

But
he
said
IBM
would
have
won
the
business
anyway
as
a
sale
to
a
third
party
that
would
have
then
leased
the
equipment
to
the
customer
.

He
said
IBM
has
not
only
hurt
its
short-term
revenue
outlook
but
has
also
been
losing
money
on
its
leases
.

Bob
Bardagy
,
executive
vice
president
of
marketing
at
Comdisco
Inc.
,
a
huge
leasing
firm
,
said
:
``
To
put
it
mildly
,
IBM
Credit
has
been
doing
some
of
the
worst
economic
deals
of
any
leasing
company
we
have
ever
seen
.

''
IBM
is
expected
to
get
a
boost
soon
when
it
announces
some
new
versions
of
its
mainframes
.

But
the
basic
technology
in
the
line
is
almost
five
years
old
,
which
means
it
is
long
in
the
tooth
,
and
competitors
are
rolling
out
strong
products
of
their
own
.

IBM
is
gaining
momentum
in
the
personal-computer
market
,
and
is
expected
to
introduce
some
impressive
workstations
early
next
year
.

But
it
's
hard
to
squeeze
much
profit
out
of
the
personal-computer
business
these
days
,
and
the
workstation
market
,
while
important
,
is
too
small
to
rely
on
for
much
growth
.

The
disk
drives
will
doubtless
sell
well
when
they
finally
become
available
.

But
the
,
IBM
's
highly
successful
minicomputer
line
,
is
losing
its
momentum
,
and
some
analysts
said
sales
could
even
decline
in
the
fourth
quarter
.

In
addition
,
IBM
's
growth
in
software
in
the
third
quarter
was
just
8.8
%
,
well
below
historical
levels
even
when
adjusted
to
reflect
last
year
's
payment
from
Fujitsu
and
the
stronger
dollar
.

And
expenses
,
up
7.9
%
in
the
quarter
,
have
stayed
stubbornly
high
.

In
the
nine
months
,
IBM
earned
$
3.17
billion
,
or
$
5.43
a
share
,
down
8.4
%
from
the
year-earlier
$
3.46
billion
,
or
$
5.83
a
share
.

Revenue
increased
6.5
%
to
$
42.25
billion
from
$
39.68
billion
.

PepsiCo
Inc.
's
chairman
said
he
is
``
more
than
comfortable
with
''
analysts
'
estimates
that
third-quarter
earnings
rose
to
at
least
98
cents
to
$
1
a
share
from
91
cents
the
year
earlier
.

D.
Wayne
Calloway
,
also
chief
executive
officer
of
the
company
,
indicated
that
he
expects
analysts
to
raise
their
forecasts
for
1989
after
the
company
releases
its
earnings
today
.

So
far
,
analysts
have
said
they
are
looking
for
$
3.30
to
$
3.35
a
share
.

After
today
's
announcement
,
that
range
could
increase
to
$
3.35
to
$
3.40
a
share
.

The
official
said
he
also
would
be
comfortable
with
that
new
range
.

In
1988
,
the
soft-drink
giant
earned
$
2.90
a
share
.

Results
for
1989
will
include
about
40
cents
a
share
from
the
dilutive
effects
of
snack-food
and
bottling
company
acquisitions
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
the
company
closed
yesterday
at
$
57.125
a
share
,
up
$
3.125
.

The
company
said
third-quarter
sales
are
expected
to
increase
25
%
from
$
3.12
billion
of
last
year
's
third
quarter
.

Domestic
soft-drink
bottler
case
sales
are
estimated
to
have
risen
only
1
%
in
the
third
quarter
--
well
below
the
4
%
to
5
%
growth
of
recent
years
--
but
about
in
line
with
the
rest
of
the
soft-drink
industry
.

Mr.
Calloway
blamed
the
slower
volume
on
rainier
weather
,
a
dearth
of
new
products
in
the
industry
and
--
to
a
much
lesser
extent
--
pricing
.

PepsiCo
said
its
soft-drink
prices
were
about
2
%
higher
in
the
quarter
.

Mr.
Calloway
also
noted
that
soft-drink
volume
rose
a
hefty
9
%
in
last
year
's
third
quarter
,
making
the
comparison
more
difficult
.

International
soft-drink
volume
was
up
about
6
%
.

Snack-food
tonnage
increased
a
strong
7
%
in
the
third
quarter
,
while
domestic
profit
increased
in
double
digits
,
Mr.
Calloway
said
.

Excluding
the
British
snack-food
business
acquired
in
July
,
snack-food
international
tonnage
jumped
40
%
,
with
sales
strong
in
Spain
,
Mexico
and
Brazil
.

Total
snack-food
profit
rose
30
%
.

Led
by
Pizza
Hut
and
Taco
Bell
,
restaurant
earnings
increased
about
25
%
in
the
third
quarter
on
a
22
%
sales
increase
.

Same-store
sales
for
Pizza
Hut
rose
about
13
%
,
while
Taco
Bell
's
increased
22
%
,
as
the
chain
continues
to
benefit
from
its
price-value
strategy
.

Taco
Bell
has
turned
around
declining
customer
counts
by
permanently
lowering
the
price
of
its
tacos
.

Same
store-sales
for
Kentucky
Fried
Chicken
,
which
has
struggled
with
increased
competition
in
the
fast-food
chicken
market
and
a
lack
of
new
products
,
rose
only
1
%
.

The
operation
,
which
has
been
slow
to
respond
to
consumers
'
shifting
tastes
away
from
fried
foods
,
has
been
developing
a
grilled-chicken
product
that
may
be
introduced
nationally
at
the
end
of
next
year
.

The
new
product
has
performed
well
in
a
market
test
in
Las
Vegas
,
Nev.
,
Mr.
Calloway
said
.

After
a
four-year
,
$
7.7
billion
acquisition
binge
that
brought
a
major
soft-drink
company
,
soda
bottlers
,
a
fast-food
chain
and
an
overseas
snack-food
giant
to
Pepsi
,
Mr.
Calloway
said
he
does
n't
expect
any
major
acquisition
in
the
next
year
or
so
.

But
,
``
You
never
can
tell
,
''
he
added
,
``
you
have
to
take
advantage
of
opportunities
.

Hydro-Quebec
said
it
notified
Central
Maine
Power
Co.
it
will
cancel
a
$
4
billion
contract
to
supply
electricity
to
the
Maine
utility
.

The
provincially
owned
utility
said
it
is
tearing
up
the
deal
because
``
the
contract
's
objectives
ca
n't
be
fulfilled
.

''
Hydro-Quebec
said
Maine
regulators
'
refusal
to
approve
the
contract
earlier
this
year
halted
work
on
transmission
lines
and
stopped
negotiations
for
resale
of
electricity
carried
through
Maine
to
other
utilities
.

``
It
would
now
be
physically
impossible
to
begin
deliveries
in
1992
,
''
a
Hydro-Quebec
official
said
.

The
contract
was
to
run
from
1992
to
2020
.

Under
the
contract
Hydro-Quebec
was
to
supply
400
megawatts
of
power
to
Central
Maine
Power
starting
in
1992
,
600
megawatts
starting
in
1995
and
900
megawatts
starting
in
Hydro-Quebec
said
Maine
regulators
'
refusal
to
approve
the
contract
means
Central
Maine
Power
has
lost
its
place
in
line
.

``
We
wo
n't
sign
any
new

{
with

beginning
earlier
than

''
the
Hydro-Quebec

said
.

He
said
Hydro-Quebec
already
has
some
``
customers
in
mind
''
for
the
power
that
was
to
be
delivered
to
Maine
.

``
Nothing
has
happened
since

acceptable
choice

CHICAGO
-
Options
traders
were
among
the
big
victims
of
Friday
's
plunging
stock
market
,
including
one
small
firm
that
required
an
emergency
$
50
million
bailout
.

While
Monday
's
rebounding
markets
helped
other
investors
recoup
losses
,
many
options
customers
and
professional
traders
in
stock-index
options
and
the
options
on
takeover
stocks
were
left
with
multimillion-dollar
losses
,
traders
here
and
in
New
York
said
.

Options
traders
were
hurt
worse
than
others
on
Friday
because
of
the
highly
volatile
nature
of
options
,
which
often
rise
or
fall
in
value
several
times
the
amount
of
the
price
change
in
the
individual
stock
or
index
of
stocks
on
which
they
are
based
.

Thus
,
options
traders
Friday
were
stuck
with
losses
that
also
were
several
times
larger
than
those
suffered
by
many
stock
traders
in
New
York
.

Jeffrey
Miller
of
Miller
Tabak
Hirsch
&
Co.
said
that
given
the
high
degree
of
leverage
in
the
options
market
,
it
is
``
very
easy
for
these
guys
to
get
wiped
out
.

That
may
just
be
the
nature
of
these
highly
leveraged
little
creatures
.

''
An
options
contract
gives
the
holder
the
right
to
buy
(
call
)
or
sell
(
put
)
a
specific
amount
of
stock
,
or
in
this
case
the
value
of
a
stock
index
,
based
on
a
predetermined
price
within
a
given
time
period
.

Options
traders
who
,
in
return
for
a
small
fee
,
or
premium
,
had
previously
sold
put
options
on
stocks
or
stock
indexes
were
forced
on
Friday
to
buy
those
contracts
back
at
the
previously
agreed
prices
,
which
were
substantially
above
those
in
the
market
as
it
was
falling
.

They
then
had
no
choice
in
many
cases
but
to
sell
the
contracts
at
prevailing
prices
--
in
most
cases
at
a
substantial
loss
.

The
latest
round
of
losses
is
likely
to
be
a
serious
blow
to
the
Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
,
which
has
never
fully
recovered
from
the
aftershock
of
Black
Monday
,
when
investors
fled
the
market
because
of
huge
losses
.

Making
matters
worse
was
the
fact
that
late
Friday
afternoon
the
CBOE
halted
stock-index
options
trading
in
step
with
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
halt
in
stock-index
futures
.

But
while
the
Merc
reopened
a
half
hour
later
,
the
CBOE
remained
closed
,
leaving
many
options
traders
unable
to
make
trades
that
might
have
reduced
the
losses
.

CBOE
Chairman
Alger
``
Duke
''
Chapman
,
said
that
,
unlike
the
futures
market
,
the
options
exchange
has
to
open
in
a
rotation
that
allows
each
different
options
series
to
trade
.

Exchange
officials
reasoned
that
they
would
n't
have
been
able
to
make
such
a
rotation
with
the
time
remaining
Friday
afternoon
,
and
with
the
stock-index
futures
on
the
verge
of
closing
for
a
second
and
final
time
,
the
CBOE
reasoned
that
its
best
course
was
to
remain
closed
.

The
damage
was
so
bad
at
Fossett
Corp.
,
an
options
trading
firm
here
,
that
it
was
forced
to
transfer
its
accounts
to
First
Options
of
Chicago
,
a
unit
of
Continental
Bank
Corp.
,
as
a
result
of
options
trading
losses
.

Fosset
so
far
is
the
only
member
of
a
financial
exchange
to
be
forced
to
be
taken
over
by
another
firm
as
a
result
of
Friday
's
rout
.

Fossett
still
had
several
million
dollars
in
capital
left
after
Friday
's
close
of
trading
,
but
not
enough
that
regulators
,
worried
about
another
potential
market
plunge
yesterday
,
would
let
it
reopen
for
trading
,
options
exchange
officials
said
.

Thus
,
in
an
unprecedented
arrangement
underscoring
the
seriousness
of
the
transfer
,
the
CBOE
,
the
American
Stock
Exchange
and
the
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
as
well
as
the
firm
's
owner
,
Stephen
Fossett
,
put
up
a
total
of
$
50
million
to
guarantee
the
customer
positions
being
transferred
to
the
bank
holding
company
subsidiary
in
case
the
market
plunged
again
yesterday
.

S.
Waite
Rawls
III
,
vice
chairman
of
Continental
Bank
,
First
Options
'
parent
company
,
said
the
firm
took
on
about
160
accounts
formerly
held
by
Fossett
,
almost
all
of
them
belonging
to
professional
floor
traders
.

``
Steve
and
his
firm
were
still
worth
a
lot
of
money
,
''
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

``
A
package
of
credit
support
was
put
together
--
including
the
assets
of
Steve
and
his
firm
.

''
The
bailout
was
cobbled
together
over
the
weekend
,
with
officials
from
the
Federal
Reserve
Board
,
Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
,
Comptroller
of
the
Currency
and
Treasury
as
well
as
the
options
exchanges
.

``
It
was
great
to
have
the
luxury
of
time
,
''
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

At
one
point
,
an
options
industry
official
had
to
talk
the
Federal
Reserve
Bank
of
Chicago
's
night
watchman
into
giving
him
the
home
phone
number
of
Silas
Keene
,
Chicago
Fed
president
.

First
Options
did
n't
have
to
put
any
money
into
the
bailout
.

Yesterday
's
rally
in
the
stock
,
futures
and
options
markets
led
CBOE
and
Amex
officials
to
conclude
that
the
$
50
million
in
guarantees
almost
certainly
wo
n't
need
to
be
tapped
by
First
Options
.

The
Fossett
firm
had
some
losses
and
liquidity
problems
during
the
October
1987
crash
as
well
,
Mr.
Rawls
said
.

A
federal
official
said
that
Continental
Bank
worked
with
securities
and
banking
regulators
over
the
weekend
to
fashion
the
Fossett
bailout
,
but
that
conditions
were
n't
dictated
by
those
agencies
.

``
It
was
their
business
decision
,
''
the
official
said
.

Officials
at
Options
Clearing
Corp.
,
which
processes
all
options
trades
for
U.S.
exchanges
,
said
that
the
$
50
million
guarantee
was
unprecedented
,
but
was
necessary
to
help
insure
the
integrity
of
the
options
markets
.

``
It
was
an
extraordinary
situation
that
needed
extraordinary
steps
,
''
said
Paul
Stevens
,
OCC
president
and
chief
operating
officer
.

Mr.
Stevens
declined
to
give
the
specific
contributions
to
the
$
50
million
guarantee
from
each
participant

Debora
Foster
takes
off
her
necklace
,
settles
herself
on
a
padded
chair
and
gently
leans
forward
.

With
a
jazz-piano
tape
playing
softly
in
the
background
,
the
soothing
hands
of
Sabina
Vidunas
begin
to
work
on
Ms.
Foster
's
neck
and
shoulders
.

``
It
's
like
an
oasis
in
this
room
,
''
Ms.
Foster
purrs
.

The
room
in
question
is
the
directors
'
lounge
of
H.J.
Heinz
Co.
,
60
floors
above
the
bustle
of
Pittsburgh
.

There
,
amid
oil
paintings
and
marble
tables
,
massages
are
administered
every
Wednesday
.

``
On
days
that
I
'm
really
busy
,
''
says
Ms.
Foster
,
who
works
in
public
relations
for
the
company
,
``
it
seems
decadent
to
take
time
off
for
a
massage
.

''
Although
such
sessions
may
never
replace
coffee
breaks
,
on-site
massage
,
as
it
is
known
in
the
trade
,
is
certainly
infiltrating
corporate
America
.

In
some
companies
middle
managers
sneak
massage
therapists
into
the
office
,
fearful
that
upper-level
executives
wo
n't
approve
.

Ms.
Foster
's
indulgence
is
nothing
like
the
oily
,
hour-long
rubfests
enjoyed
by
spa
visitors
.

Nor
does
it
at
all
resemble
(
despite
what
some
executives
think
)
the
more
intimate
variety
offered
at
specialty
parlors
in
bad
parts
of
town
.

On
the
contrary
,
office
rubdowns
usually
take
place
in
dimly
lighted
conference
rooms
,
where
stressed-out
employees
relax
in
specially
designed
chairs
,
fully
clothed
.

The
massages
last
15
minutes
and
typically
cost
about
$
10
.

Some
companies
,
including
Heinz
,
even
pay
part
of
the
fee
.

Ms.
Vidunas
has
been
seeing
some
15
clients
a
visit
since
the
program
was
started
at
Heinz
last
year
.

Anthony
J.F.
O'Reilly
,
the
company
's
chairman
,
swears
by
her
firm
touch
,
saying
regular
massages
are
a
balm
for
his
old
football
injuries
.

Massage
advocates
say
that
kneading
the
head
,
shoulders
,
neck
and
back
can
go
a
long
way
toward
easing
tension
and
improving
morale
.

They
also
insist
that
touching
is
a
basic
need
,
as
powerful
as
the
need
for
food
or
sleep
,
and
that
the
office
is
as
good
a
place
as
any
to
do
it
.

``
The
blood
flows
to
your
head
,
you
feel
lightheaded
and
you
do
n't
feel
tension
around
the
head
or
neck
,
''
says
Minnie
Morey
,
an
operations
supervisor
at
the
Social
Security
office
in
Grand
Rapids
,
Mich.
,
where
massages
began
last
month
.

``
When
you
leave
the
room
after
your
massage
,
people
say
you
look
like
you
're
glowing
.

''
Adds
Candice
Ohlman
,
the
35-year-old
masseuse
who
plies
her
trade
in
the
Grand
Rapids
office
,
``
They
fall
in
love
with
my
hands
.

''
Not
everyone
,
however
,
is
at
ease
with
office
massage
.

Three
years
ago
,
the
Internal
Revenue
Service
's
office
in
San
Jose
,
Calif.
,
opened
its
doors
to
on-site
massage
.

And
even
though
employees
paid
the
bill
,
taxpayers
grumbled
.

``
Sometimes
,
with
the
release
of
stress
,
you
hear
`
oohs
'
and
`
ahs
'
coming
out
of
the
room
,
''
explains
Morgan
Banks
,
the
agency
's
health
specialist
.

``
And
you
ca
n't
have
taxpayers
coming
into
an
audit
hearing
`
oohs
'
and
`
ahs
.

'
''
Last
month
,
the
complaints
intensified
and
the
massages
ended
.

``
Now
we
're
looking
for
a
room
with
thicker
walls
,
''
Ms.
Banks
says
.

Massage
also
has
an
image
problem
to
contend
with
.

Some
masseurs
have
tried
to
get
around
this
by
calling
themselves
``
bodyworkers
''
and
describing
their
office
visits
as
``
reinvigoration
breaks
.

''
But
massage
,
no
matter
how
chaste
,
is
still
associated
in
many
minds
with
seedy
fronts
for
prostitution
,
and
that
makes
some
executives
nervous
.

Last
year
,
the
research
and
development
division
of
Weyerhaeuser
Co.
,
the
large
wood-products
concern
,
invited
a
masseuse
to
its
Tacoma
,
Wash.
,
offices
.

Phil
Harms
,
a
software
engineer
,
was
an
eager
customer
.

``
You
build
up
a
lot
of
tension
working
at
a
terminal
all
day
,
''
he
says
.

But
after
about
eight
months
,
the
vice
president
of
the
division
,
Ed
Soule
,
learned
about
the
sessions
and
brought
them
to
a
halt
.

Mr.
Soule
says
his
only
beef
was
that
the
massages
were
being
given
in
a
company
conference
room
;
the
department
's
supervised
health
facility
would
have
been
fine
.

``
In
my
view
,
{
massages
}
should
be
managed
with
an
appropriate
mixture
of
males
and
females
around
,
''
he
says
.

Given
such
attitudes
,
some
corporate
masseurs
prefer
to
go
about
their
business
quietly
.

Russell
Borner
of
Park
Ridge
,
N.J.
,
says
he
has
been
working
for
the
past
year
at
a
huge
chemical
and
manufacturing
concern
in
New
York
--
unbeknownst
to
the
company
's
executives
.

He
visits
the
same
department
every
two
or
three
weeks
.

His
massage
chair
is
kept
in
a
closet
,
and
a
secretary
escorts
him
past
security
.

``
This
is
common
with
a
lot
of
large
companies
,
''
says
Mr.
Borner
,
who
worked
for
American
Telephone
&
Telegraph
Co.
for
23
years
before
choosing
his
current
trade
.

Managers
,
he
contends
,
``
are
afraid
how
they
're
going
to
look
in
the
eyes
of
their
peers
.

My
vision
is
to
change
human
consciousness
towards
touch
.

My
attitude
is
:
Let
's
come
out
of
the
closet
.

''
Occasionally
,
all
that
's
needed
is
a
little
coaxing
.

Elisa
Byler

St.
Louis
masseuse
,
won
over

at
Emerson
Electric
Co.
,
a
maker
of
electrical
and
electronic
equipment
,
by
providing
documents
and
other
articles
trumpeting
the
therapeutic
benefits
of
massage
.

She
notes
that
she
also
stresses
professionalism
during
her
weekly
visits
.

``
I
pull
my
hair
back
,
wear
a
little
makeup
and
look
corporate
,
''
says
Ms.
Byler
,
who
has
been
visiting
Emerson
since
January
.

``
If
I
go
in
there
as
I
normally
dress
,
they
'd
ask
,
`
Who
is
this
hippie
?
'
''
The
self-proclaimed
father
of
on-site
massage
is
David
Palmer
,
a
41-year-old
San
Francisco
masseur
whose
mission
is
to
save
the
touch-starved
masses
.

To
help
do
this
,
Mr.
Palmer
developed
a
portable
massage
chair
three
years
ago
that
he
hopes
will
bring
``
structured
touching
''
into
mainstream
America
.

``
The
culture
is
not
ready
to
take
off
its
clothes
,
lie
down
and
be
touched
for
an
hour
for
$
45
,
''
he
says
.

``
The
idea
is
to
keep
the
clothes
on
and
to
keep
people
seated
.

The
chair
is
a
way
to
package
massage
.

''
Sitting
in
one
of
Mr.
Palmer
's

,
which
cost
$
425

been
copied

is
a
bit
like
straddling
a
recliner
.

Customers
lean
forward
,
rest
their
knees
on
side
supports
and
bury
their
face
in
padding
on
the
back
of
the
chair
.

Ms.
Ohlman
,
the
Grand
Rapids
masseuse
,
says
she
has
heard
the
odd-looking
contraption
compared
to
something
out
of
the
Spanish
Inquisition

)
Mr.
Palmer
,
who
serves
as
president
of
the
On-Site
Massage
Association
and
writes
an
industry
newsletter
,
says
some
4,000
practitioners
--
out
of
about
50,000
certified
masseurs
across
the
country
--
now
use
massage
chairs
in
the
workplace
,
as
well
as
on
street
corners
,
in
airports
and
malls
,
and
at
conventions
and
other
gatherings
where
weary
people
can
be
found
.

Scot
MacInnis
,
a
masseur
in
Boulder
,
Colo.
,
had
a
scary
experience
while
massaging
a
man
in
a
natural-foods
supermarket
as
part
of
a
store
promotion
.

Three
minutes
into
the
massage
,
the
man
curled
up
,
began
shaking
and
turned
red
.

Paramedics
were
called
.

A
week
later
,
the
man
told
Mr.
MacInnis
he
had
suffered
a
mild
heart
attack
unrelated
to
the
massage
.

``
It
was
a
powerful
point
in
my
career
,
''
says
the
31-year-old
Mr.
MacInnis
,
who
has
since
taken
out
a
$
1
million
liability
policy
for
his
business
.

``
But
he
pulled
through
,
and
after
the
ambulance
left
,
there
were
still
six
people
in
line
waiting
for
a
massage
.

The
next
woman
was
older
,
and
I
was
afraid
to
touch
her
.

But
it
's
like
falling
off
a
horse
and
getting
back
on
.

''
Despite
the
number
of
fans
that
office
massage
has
won
,
some
purists
look
down
on
it
,
arguing
that
naked
,
full-body
rubs
are
the
only
way
to
go
.

Linda
Aldridge
,
who
does
full-body
work
in
Pittsburgh
,
says
that
while
on-site
massage
is
better
than
nothing
,
tired
workers
should
realize
it
is
only
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
.

``
Whole
areas
of
their
bodies
are
neglected
,
''
she
says
,
adding
that
clothes
ruin
the
experience
.

``
There
's
nothing
like
skin
to
skin

''
In
what
is
believed
to
be
the
first
cancellation
of
a
loan
to
China
since
the
June
4
killings
in
Beijing
,
an
international
bank
syndicate
has
terminated
a
$
55
million
credit
for
a
Shanghai
property
project
.

The
syndicate
,
led
by
Schroders
Asia
Ltd.
,
agreed
last
November
to
provide
the
loan
to
Asia
Development
Corp.
,
a
U.S.
property
developer
.

But
several
weeks
ago
,
in
the
wake
of
the
Beijing
killings
,
the
loan
was
canceled
,
according
to
bankers
and
executives
close
to
the
project
.

Asia
Development
and
Schroders
declined
to
comment
on
the
move
.

Lenders
had
doubts
about
the
project
even
before
June
4
,
but
the
harsh
crackdown
,
which
caused
many
businesses
to
reassess
their
China
transactions
,
``
gave
the
banks
the
out
they
wanted
,
''
says
an
official
close
to
the
Shanghai
venture
.

The
decision
to
cancel
the
loan
exemplifies
the
tough
attitude
bankers
have
taken
toward
China
since
June
4
.

While
some
commercial
lending
has
resumed
,
international
lenders
remain
nervous
about
China
's
economic
troubles
and
foreign
debt
--
$
40
billion
at
the
end
of
1988
.

Many
loans
are
being
renegotiated
,
especially
those
tied
to
the
hotel
sector
,
which
has
been
hit
hard
by
a
post-June
4
tourism
slump
.

Many
bankers
view
property-sector
loans
as
particularly
risky
.

The
canceled
Shanghai
loan
leaves
Asia
Development
,
a
small
concern
,
saddled
with
a
half-completed
32-story
apartment
building
and
heavy
debts
.

The
company
owes
$
11
million
to
the
Shui
On
Group
,
the
project
's
Hong
Kong
contractor
,
and
a
significant
,
though
unspecified
,
amount
in
legal
fees
to
Coudert
Brothers
,
a
U.S.
law
firm
,
the
sources
say
.

The
project
,
known
as
Lotus
Mansion
,
has
been
mired
in
controversy
.

When
the
loan
agreement
was
announced
,
it
was
hailed
as
one
of
the
first
Western-style
financing
transactions
ever
used
in
China
.

Unlike
most
loans
to
China
,
there
was
no
Chinese
guarantor
.

Instead
,
the
banks
secured
a
promise
from
state-owned
Bank
of
Communications
that
it
would
lend
Asia
Development
the
entire
$
55
million
at
maturity
to
finance
repayment
of
the
original
borrowing
.

The
loan
was
to
have
matured
in
just
two
to
three
years
,
as
soon
as
construction
was
completed
.

But
in
a
letter
sent
in
August
to
Asia
Development
,
Schroders
said
the
loan
was
terminated
because
the
developer
had
failed
to
deliver
adequate
financial
data
and
pay
certain
fees
to
the
loan-management
committee
on
time
,
according
to
officials
close
to
the
project
.

Creditors
involved
in
the
project
contend
,
however
,
that
the
termination
actually
had
nothing
to
do
with
these
technical
violations
.

Instead
,
the
creditors
say
,
the
loan
fell
victim
to
nervousness
about
China
's
political
turmoil
,
as
well
as
to
concern
about
the
loan
's
security
.

The
bank
syndicate
is
made
up
mostly
of
European
banks
,
but
it
includes
China
's
state-owned
Citic
Industrial
Bank
.

The
11
banks
in
the
syndicate
sustained
no
monetary
losses
because
none
of
the
credit
facility
had
been
drawn
down
.

K
mart
Corp.
agreed
to
acquire
Pace
Membership
Warehouse
Inc.
for
$
23
a
share
,
or
$
322
million
,
in
a
move
to
expand
its
presence
in
the
rapidly
growing
warehouse-club
business
.

The
proposed
merger
comes
as
K
mart
's
profit
is
declining
and
sales
at
its
core
discount
stores
are
rising
more
slowly
than
at
such
competitors
as
Wal-Mart
Stores
Inc
.

K
mart
,
based
in
Troy
,
Mich.
,
recently
said
net
income
would
fall
for
the
third
consecutive
quarter
,
after
a
16
%
drop
in
the
first
half
of
its
current
fiscal
year
.

``
The
membership
warehouse-club
concept
has
great
potential
,
''
the
company
's
chairman
,
Joseph
E.
Antonini
,
said
in
a
statement
.

Warehouse
clubs
typically
carry
general
merchandise
and
food
products
,
which
they
sell
for
close
to
wholesale
prices
in
no-frills
stores
.

Shoppers
,
many
of
whom
operate
small
businesses
,
pay
annual
membership
fees
,
which
provide
an
income
base
for
the
stores
.

K
mart
tested
the
warehouse-club
sector
last
year
with
its
acquisition
of
a
51
%
interest
in
Makro
Inc
.

But
the
Makro
chain
,
which
operates
as
a
joint
venture
between
K
mart
and
SHV
Holdings
N.V.
of
the
Netherlands
,
has
only
six
stores
and
annual
sales
that
one
analyst
estimated
at
about
$
300
million
.

Six-year-old
Pace
,
based
in
Aurora
,
Colo.
,
operates
41
warehouse-club
stores
.

The
company
had
losses
for
several
years
before
turning
profitable
in
fiscal
1988
.

In
the
year
ended
Jan.
31
,
Pace
rang
up
profit
of
$
9.4
million
,
or
72
cents
a
share
,
after
a
tax-loss
carry-forward
,
on
sales
of
$
1.3
billion
,
and
analysts
expect
its
results
to
continue
to
improve
.

``
The
company
turned
the
corner
fairly
recently
in
profitability
,
''
said
Margo
McGlade
of
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
who
had
been
forecasting
a
46
%
jump
in
Pace
's
net
income
from
operations
this
year
and
another
42
%
increase
next
year
.

``
Warehouse
productivity
is
really
beginning
to
take
off
.

''
But
some
analysts
contend
K
mart
has
agreed
to
pay
too
much
for
Pace
.

``
Even
if
you
look
at
it
as
a
turnaround
situation
,
it
's
expensive
,
''
said
Wayne
Hood
of
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc
.

``
In
my
opinion
,
you
would
only
pay
that
kind
of
price
if
you
were
getting
a
premier
player
in
the
industry
.

''
Ms.
McGlade
of
PaineWebber
raised
a
more
fundamental
question
about
the
deal
.

``
If
K
mart
ca
n't
get
its
act
together
in
discounting
,
why
is
it
spending
time
worrying
about
other
growing
markets
?
''
She
said
,
``
I
would
say
K
mart
's
number
one
job
is
to
address
its
market-share
loss
{
in
discount
stores
}
,
which
longer-term
will
lead
to
improved
profit
margins
.

At
that
point
,
perhaps
diversification
would
be
appropriate
.

''
But
K
mart
's
Mr.
Antonini
is
intent
on
pushing
the
company
into
new
retail
businesses
.

For
instance
,
K
mart
is
opening
big
food
and
general
merchandise
stores
,
called
hypermarkets
,
and
warehouse-type
stores
specializing
in
office
products
and
sporting
goods
.

It
also
operates
Waldenbooks
,
Pay
Less
Drug
Stores
and
Builders
Square
home
improvement
stores
.

In
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
K
mart
closed
yesterday
at
$
36
a
share
,
up
12.5
cents
.

Pace
rose
$
2.625
to
close
at
$
22.125
a
share
in
national
over-the-counter
trading
.

A
K
mart
spokesman
said
the
acquisition
would
be
financed
with
short-term
borrowings
.

Under
terms
of
the
agreement
,
a
K
mart
subsidiary
will
soon
make
a
tender
offer
for
Pace
shares
.

Among
the
conditions
of
the
offer
is
that
Pace
shareholders
tender
a
majority
of
the
company
's
shares
outstanding
.

The
companies
said
Pace
would
ill
continue
to
operate
under
its
present
management
.

G.

Traders
nervously
watching
their
Quotron
electronic-data
machines
yesterday
morning
were
stunned
to
see
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
plummet
99
points
in
seconds
.

A
minute
later
it
soared
128
points
,
then
zoomed
back
down
113
points
,
69
below
Friday
's
close
.

``
It
was
crazy
,
''
said
Neil
Weisman
,
general
partner
of
Chilmark
Capital
Corp
.

``
It
was
like
flying
without
a
pilot
in
the
front
of
the
plane
.

''
But
those
who
said
``
This
ca
n't
be
happening
''
were
right
.

The
Quotrons
were
wrong
.

Quotron
Systems
Inc.
,
a
Citicorp
unit
,
blamed
the
30-minute
foul-up
on
``
a
timing
problem
in
our
software
''
caused
by
the
enormous
early
volume
--
about
145
million
shares
in
the
first
hour
of
New
York
Stock
Exchange
trading
.

The
prices
of
the
individual
stocks
that
make
up
the
average
were
correct
,
Quotron
said
,
but
the
average
was
wrong
.

Meanwhile
,
there
was
an
awful
lot
of
confusion
.

At
about
10:40
a.m.
on
the
over-the-counter
trading
desk
at
a
major
brokerage
firm
,
a
veteran
trader
who
buys
and
sells
some
of
the
most
active
stocks
looked
at
a
senior
official
and
asked
,
``
What
's
going
on
?
Is
the
market
up
or
down
?
''
At
the
time
,
Quotron
was
reporting
that
the
industrial
average
was
down
70
points
.

In
fact
,
it
was
up
24
.

Holly
Stark
,
a
vice
president
who
heads
the
trading
desk
at
Dillon
Read
Capital
Corp.
,
said
that
once
she
figured
out
the
Quotron
numbers
were
wrong
,
she
called
brokers
to
tell
them
.

``
It
's
been
kind
of
annoying
,
to
say
the
least
,
''
she
said
.

To
confuse
matters
further
,
when
UAL
Corp.
stock
finally
opened
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
at
11:08
a.m.
,
the
price
was
listed
at
$
324.75
a
share
,
up
about
$
45
from
Friday
;
in
fact
,
its
true
price
was
$
224.75
,
down
$
55
.

That
was
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
's
blooper
.

A
spokesman
cited
a
``
technical
error
''
and
declined
to
elaborate
.

And
there
were
other
blunders
.

When
the
market
opened
at
9:30
a.m.
EST
,
a
reporter
for
the
Reuters
newswire
miscalculated
the
industrial
average
's
drop
as
a
4
%
decline
when
it
really
was
down
0.7
%
.

``
It
was
a
case
of
human
error
,
which
we
found
almost
immediately
and
corrected
,
''
a
spokesman
for
Reuter
in
New
York
said
.

Meanwhile
,
some
currency
traders
at
West
German
banks
in
Frankfurt
said
they
sold
dollars
on
the
news
and
had
to
buy
them
back
later
at
higher
prices
.

But
it
was
the
Quotron
problems
that
had
lingering
effects
.

Dillon
Read
's
Ms.
Stark
said
in
early
afternoon
that
she
was
still
viewing
prices
and
other
data
as
subject
to
verification
,
and
she
said
portfolio
managers
continued
to
question
the
numbers
they
saw
on
the
screen
.

It
was
the
second
time
in
less
than
a
week
that
Quotron
has
had
problems
calculating
the
industrial
average
.

At
the
start
of
trading
last
Wednesday
,
the
average
appeared
to
plunge
more
than
200
points
.

Actually
,
it
was
down
only
a
few
points
at
the
time
.

Quotron
said
that
snafu
,
which
lasted
nine
minutes
,
resulted
from
a
failure
to
adjust
for
a
4-for-1
stock
split
at
Philip
Morris
Cos
.

A
Quotron
spokeswoman
said
recent
software
changes
may
have
contributed
to
yesterday
's
problems
.

She
said
Quotron
switched
to
a
backup
system
until
the
problems
were
corrected
.

``
Today
of
all
days
,
''
she
lamented
.

``
The
eyes
of
the
world
were
watching
us

Steven

Houston
attorney
Dale
Friend
,
representing
a
plaintiff
in
a
damage
suit
,
says
he
has
negotiated
a
settlement
that
will
strike
a
blow
for
his
client
.

Literally
.

It
turns
out
Mr.
Friend
's
client
,
Machelle
Parks
of
Cincinnati
,
did
n't
like
the
way
defense
attorney
Tom
Alexander
acted
during
the
legal
proceedings
.

So
she
has
agreed
to
forgo
monetary
damages
against
Mr.
Alexander
's
client
in
return
for
the
right
to
punch
the
attorney
.

Ms.
Parks
's
mother
also
gets
to
cuff
Mr.
Alexander
.

So
does
Mr.
Friend
and
his
law
partner
,
Nick
Nichols
.

The
bizarre
arrangement
grows
out
of
Mr.
Alexander
's
representation
of
Derr
Construction
Co.
,
one
of
several
defendants
in
a
wrongful
death
lawsuit
brought
by
Ms.
Parks
,
the
widow
of
a
construction
worker
killed
in
January
1987
while
working
on
a
new
Houston
convention
center
.

Last
month
,
Mr.
Friend
says
,
Mr.
Alexander
's
associate
agreed
that
Derr
would
pay
$
50,000
as
part
of
an
overall
settlement
.

But
Mr.
Alexander
scuttled
the
deal
at
the
last
minute
,
angering
the
plaintiff
's
side
.

``
I
never
agreed
to
it
,
''
Mr.
Alexander
says
,
adding
that
``
it
's
not
necessary
to
pay
these
nuisance
settlements
.

''
When
Ms.
Parks
and
her
mother
heard
about
what
had
happened
,
Mr.
Friend
says
,
they
volunteered
that
they
would
like
to
give
Mr.
Alexander
a
good
walloping
.

Mr.
Friend
says
he
passed
that
along
to
his
adversary
,
and
soon
they
were
talking
about
the
ground
rules
under
which
Derr
could
keep
its
money
and
the
plaintiffs
could
take
a
shot
at
Mr.
Alexander
.

Although
time
and
place
have
yet
to
be
determined
,
some
details
are
in
place
.

Mr.
Friend
says
he
agreed
to
strike
Mr.
Alexander
above
the
belt
.

Ms.
Parks
and
her
mother
indicated
they
want
to
``
catch
him
unawares
from
behind
,
''
he
says
.

Mr.
Alexander
,
for
his
part
,
insisted
that
the
punchers
ca
n't
assign
their
pummeling
rights
to
anyone
else
,
ca
n't
use
a
blunt
instrument
and
ca
n't
take
a
running
start
.

Mr.
Alexander
says
he
regards
the
agreement
,
which
has
n't
been
submitted
to
a
judge
,
as
something
of
a
joke
.

However
,
he
acknowledges
they
``
have
the
option
of
taking
a
swat
at
me
if
they
really
want
to
.

''
Mr.
Friend
says
his
side
is
``
dead
serious
.

''
Although
they
do
n't
contemplate
delivering
any
disabling
blows
,
he
says
that
Mr.
Alexander
will
be
asked
to
sign
a
release
from
liability
,
just
in
case
.

After
two
years
of
drought
,
it
rained
money
in
the
stock-index
futures
markets
yesterday
.

As
financial
markets
rebounded
,
trading
volume
in
the
Chicago
Mercantile
Exchange
's
huge
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
stock-index
futures
pit
soared
,
reaching
near-record
levels
for
the
first
time
since
October
1987
.

The
sudden
influx
of
liquidity
enabled
several
traders
to
reap
six-figure
windfalls
in
a
matter
of
minutes
as
prices
soared
,
traders
said
.

``
Guys
were
minting
money
in
there
today
,
''
said
John
Legittino
,
a
futures
broker
for
Elders
Futures
Inc.
in
Chicago
.

The
S&P
500
futures
contract
,
which
moves
in
fractions
of
an
index
point
under
normal
conditions
,
jumped
two
to
three
points
in
seconds
early
yesterday
after
an
initial
downturn
,
then
moved
strongly
higher
the
rest
of
the
day
.

Each
index
point
represents
a
$
500
profit
for
each
S&P
500
contract
held
.

For
the
first
time
since
the
1987
crash
,
traders
said
that
they
were
able
to
trade
several
hundred
S&P
500
contracts
at
a
time
in
a
highly
liquid
market
.

Many
institutions
and
individual
investors
have
shied
away
from
stock-index
futures
,
blaming
them
for
speeding
the
stock
market
crash
on
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
.

Since
the
crash
,
many
futures
traders
have
n't
assumed
large
positions
for
fear
that
the
S&P
500
market
,
with
much
of
its
customer
order
flow
missing
,
would
dry
up
if
prices
turned
against
them
.

More
than
400
traders
jammed
the
S&P
500
futures
pit
to
await
the
opening
bell
.

Traders
were
shouting
bids
and
offers
a
full
five
minutes
before
the
start
of
trading
at
8:30
am
The
contract
fell
five
points
at
the
open
to
323.85
,
the
maximum
opening
move
allowed
under
safeguards
adopted
by
the
Merc
to
stem
a
market
slide
.

But
several
traders
quickly
stepped
up
and
bid
for
contracts
,
driving
prices
sharply
higher
.

The
market
hovered
near
Friday
's
closing
price
of
328.85
for
about
a
half
hour
,
moving
several
index
points
higher
or
lower
in
seconds
,
then
broke
higher
and
did
n't
look
back
.

The
S&P
500
contract
that
expires
in
December
closed
up
a
record
15.65
points
on
volume
of
nearly
80,000
contracts
.

``
Traders
five
feet
from
each
other
were
making
bids
and
offers
that
were
a
full
point
apart
,
''
said
one
S&P
500
broker
.

``
You
could
buy
at
the
bid
and
sell
at
the
offer
and
make
a
fortune
,
''
he
marveled
.

Several
of
Wall
Street
's
largest
securities
firms
,
including
Salomon
Brothers
Inc.
and
PaineWebber
Inc.
,
were
also
large
buyers
,
traders
said
.

Salomon
Brothers
was
among
the
largest
sellers
of
stock-index
futures
last
week
,
traders
said
.

Brokerage
firms
as
a
rule
do
n't
comment
on
their
market
activity
.

Unlike
the
week
following
Black
Monday
two
years
ago
,
individual
traders
in
the
S&P
500
pit
were
also
being
uncharacteristically
circumspect
about
their
one-day
profits
.

``
With
the
FBI
around
here
,
bragging
rights
are
a
thing
of
the
past
,
''
said
one
trader
,
referring
to
the
federal
investigation
of
futures
trading
that
so
far
has
resulted
in
46
indictments
lodged
against
individuals
on
the
Merc
and
the
Chicago
Board
of
Trade
.

The
market
for
$
200
billion
of
high-yield
junk
bonds
regained
some
of
its
footing
as
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
rebounded
from
Friday
's
plunge
.

But
the
junk
recovery
,
led
by
the
bellwether
RJR
Holdings
bonds
,
was
precarious
.

No
trading
existed
for
the
vast
majority
of
junk
bonds
,
securities
industry
officials
said
.

On
Friday
,
trading
in
practically
every
issue
ground
to
a
halt
as
potential
buyers
fled
and
brokerage
firms
were
unwilling
to
provide
bid
and
offer
prices
for
most
issues
.

``
Nothing
traded
on
Friday
,
and
people
were
n't
really
sure
where
the
market
should
have
opened
''
yesterday
,
said
Raymond
Minella
,
co-head
of
merchant
banking
at
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co
.

``
But
we
had
a
fairly
active
day
yesterday
.

''
At
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
the
leading
underwriter
of
junk
bonds
,
``
I
was
prepared
to
be
in
a
very
bad
mood
tonight
,
''
said
David
Feinman
,
a
junk
bond
trader
.

``
Now
,
I
feel
maybe
there
's
a
little
bit
of
euphoria
.

''
But
before
the
stock
market
rebounded
from
a
sharp
early
sell-off
yesterday
,
he
said
,
``
You
could
n't
buy
{
junk
bonds
}
and
you
could
n't
give
them
away
.

''
Yesterday
's
rally
was
led
by
RJR
Holdings
13
%
bonds
,
which
initially
tumbled
three
points
,
or
$
30
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
,
to
96
before
rebounding
to
99
.

Bonds
issued
by
Kroger
,
Duracell
,
Safeway
and
American
Standard
also
showed
big
gains
,
recovering
almost
all
their
losses
from
Friday
and
early
yesterday
.

But
traders
said
the
junk
bond
market
increasingly
is
separating
into
a
top-tier
group
,
in
which
trades
can
be
executed
easily
,
and
a
larger
group
of
lower-quality
bonds
in
which
liquidity
--
or
the
ability
to
trade
without
too
much
difficulty
--
has
steadily
deteriorated
this
year
.

``
Liquidity
has
n't
returned
to
the
vast
middle
ground
of
the
market
,
''
said
Mr.
Minella
of
Merrill
.

``
The
deadbeats
are
still
deadbeats
,
''
said
Mr.
Feinman
of
Drexel
.

Analysts
are
concerned
that
much
of
the
high-yield
market
will
remain
treacherous
for
investors
.

Paul
Asquith
,

professor
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
of
Technology
's

School
of
Management
,
citing
a
pattern
of
junk-bond
default
rates
that
are
low
in
the
early
years
after
issuance
and
rise
later
,
says
,
``
We
're
now
in
a
period
where
we
're
starting

see
defaults

''
Mark
Bachmann
,
a
senior
vice
president
at
Standard

Corp.
,
confirms
that
there
is
``
increasing
concern
about
the
future
liquidity
of
the
junk
bond
market
.

''
``
Junk
bonds
are
a
highly
stratified
market

''
said
Lewis
Glucksman
,
vice
chairman
of
Smith
Barney
,
Harris

.

``

''
Analysts
at
Standard

's
say
junk
bond
offerings
by
``
tightly
stretched
''
issuers

to
be
growing

``
You
could
still
have
some
very
bad
times
ahead
,
''
said
Mr.
Bachmann
.

``
It
's
possible
to
have
a
10
%
default
rate
in
one
year
,
because
we
're
already
seeing
big
problems
in
the
midst
of
a
pretty
strong
economy
.

I
'm
certainly
not
comfortable
saying
we
've
seen
the
bottom
.

''
But
yesterday
's
rally
among
``
good
''
junk
was
a
badly
needed
tonic
for
the
market
.

Many
issues
``
bounced
off
the
floor
,
''
Mr.
Minella
said
,
and
benchmark
junk
issues
``
recovered
all
of
their
losses
''
from
Friday
and
early
yesterday
.

In
contrast
,
he
says
,
``
The
stock
market
gained
back
only
about
half
what
it
lost
Friday
,
and
the
{
government
}
bond
market
lost
about
half
what
it
gained
Friday
.

''
Traders
said
yesterday
's
rally
was
fueled
by
insurance
companies
looking
for
bargains
after
a
drastic
slide
in
prices
the
past
month
.

In
addition
,
mutual
funds
did
n't
appear
to
be
major
sellers
of
high-yield
securities
as
was
expected
.

``
Sometimes
a
shakeout
is
healthy
,
''
said
Drexel
's
Mr.
Feinman
.

``
People
will
learn
to
be
more
circumspect
.

If
they
do
good
credit
analysis
,
they
will
avoid
the
hand
grenades
.

I
think
the
market
is
in
good
shape
.

''
Should
you
really
own
stocks
?
That
's
a
question
a
lot
of
people
are
asking
,
following
the
stock
market
's
stunning
display
of
volatility
.

Whipsawed
financially
and
emotionally
by
Friday
's
heartstopping
190-point
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
and
yesterday
's
88-point
rebound
,
they
're
wondering
if
an
individual
has
any
business
being
in
the
market
.

The
answer
,
say
academic
researchers
,
money
managers
and
investment
specialists
,
is
yes
--
as
long
as
you
approach
the
stock
market
as
an
investor
.

But
,
they
say
,
people
should
n't
try
to
be
traders
,
who
buy
and
sell
in
an
effort
to
ride
the
latest
economic
trend
or
catch
the
next
hot
stock
.

The
case
for
owning
stocks
over
the
long-term
is
compelling
.

``
If
you
look
at
75
years
worth
of
investment
history
--
including
the
Great
Depression
and
every
bear
market
since
--
stocks
have
outperformed
almost
everything
an
individual
could
have
owned
by
a
long
shot
,
''
says
Barry
Berlin
,
vice
president
at
First
Wachovia
Capital
Management
.

A
dollar
invested
in
the
stock
market
in
1926
would
have
grown
to
$
473.29
by
the
end
of
last
June
,
according
to
Laurence
Siegel
,
managing
director
at
Ibbotson
Associates
Inc
.

But
a
dollar
invested
in
long-term
bonds
in
1926
would
have
grown
to
only
$
16.56
,
and
a
dollar
put
in
Treasury
bills
would
equal
a
meager
$
9.29
.

The
longer
the
time
period
,
the
less
risk
there
is
of
losing
money
in
the
stock
market
.

Over
time
,
the
odds
increasingly
favor
the
investor
with
a
diversified
portfolio
.

For
instance
,
Ken
Gregory
,
a
San
Francisco
money
manager
,
calculates
that
if
an
investor
holds
a
basket
of
stocks
that
tracks
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500-stock
index
,
the
chance
of
losing
money
is
3
%
to
4
%
over
a
10-year
period
,
compared
with
15
%
over
three
years
and
30
%
over
one
year
.

``
If
you
do
n't
need
the
money
for
10
years
,
there
's
a
clear-cut
case
for
sticking
to
a
steady
core
of
stocks
,
''
Mr.
Gregory
says
.

Stock-market
investments
also
help
balance
the
other
assets
an
individual
owns
,
says
John
Blankenship
Jr.
,
president
of
the
Institute
of
Certified
Financial
Planners
.

Stocks
have
a
place
in
an
investors
'
portfolio
along
with
real
estate
,
bonds
,
international
securities
and
cash
,
he
says
.

There
are
some
important
caveats
:
Before
investing
in
stocks
,
individuals
should
have
at
least
three
to
six
months
of
living
expenses
set
aside
in
the
bank
,
most
investment
advisers
say
.

Individuals
also
should
focus
on
building
equity
in
a
home
,
which
provides
some
protection
against
inflation
,
as
well
as
a
nest-egg
that
can
be
cashed
in
late
in
life
to
help
cover
the
cost
of
retirement
living
.

People
also
should
n't
invest
money
in
stocks
that
they
'll
need
in
the
near
future
--
for
example
,
for
college
tuition
payments
or
retirement
expenses
.

``
You
may
have
to
sell
your
stocks
at
a
time
when
the
market
takes
a
plunge
,
''
says
Mr.
Blankenship
,
a
Del
Mar
,
Calif.
financial
planner
.

But
once
the
basics
are
covered
,
``
then
I
would
start
to
invest
,
even
if
it
's
as
little
as
$
1,000
,
''
says
Michael
Lipper
,
president
of
Lipper
Analytical
Services
Inc
.

He
says
individuals
should
consider
not
just
stocks
,
but
other
long-term
investments
,
such
as
high-quality
bonds
.

Despite
the
strong
case
for
stocks
,
however
,
most
pros
warn
that
individuals
should
n't
try
to
profit
from
short-term
developments
.

``
It
's
very
difficult
to
do
,
''
says
Donald
Holt
,
a
market
strategist
for
Wedbush
Morgan
Securities
,
a
Los
Angeles
brokerage
firm
.

``
Our
markets
move
so
fast
and
they
are
so
volatile
,
there
's
no
way
the
average
investor
can
compete
with
the
pros
.

''
Individual
investors
face
high
transaction
costs
of
moving
in
and
out
of
the
market
.

The
cost
of
executing
stock
orders
varies
from
brokerage
to
brokerage
and
with
the
size
of
the
order
,
but
2
%
of
the
order
's
value
is
an
average
,
says
Stephen
Boesel
,
manager
of
T.
Rowe
Price
's
Growth
and
Income
mutual
fund
.

And
assuming
their
first
investment
is
successful
,
investors
will
have
to
pay
taxes
on
their
gains
.

That
can
reduce
returns
by
a
third
or
more
,
once
local
taxes
are
included
,
Mr.
Lipper
says
.

After
that
,
individual
traders
face
the
risk
that
the
new
investment
they
choose
wo
n't
perform
well
--
so
their
trading
costs
could
be
sustained
for
nothing
.

``
It
's
very
tough
for
most
individuals
to
out-trade
the
mutual
funds
or
the
market
,
''
says
Mr.
Lipper
.

``
You
should
really
think
twice
if
you
think
you
can
out-smart
the
system
.

''
Then
,
too
,
many
individual
investors
lack
the
sturdy
emotional
makeup
professionals
say
is
needed
to
plunge
in
and
out
of
the
market
.

So
what
's
the
best
way
to
buy
stocks
?
``
Unless
an
individual
has
a
minimum
of
between
$
50,000
and
$
100,000
to
invest
in
stocks
,
he
's
still
better
off
in
mutual
funds
than
in
individual
stocks
,
in
terms
of
getting
enough
attention
from
a
competent
broker
,
''
says
Mr.
Lipper
.

Still
,
he
adds
,
``
I
could
see
owning
both
,
given
that
individuals
often
have
an
advantage
over
big
investors
in
spotting
special
situations
based
on
their
own
insights
,
''
he
adds
.

George
Douglas
,
first
vice
president
at
Drexel
Burnham
Lambert
Inc.
,
says
that
individuals
have
a
particular
edge
now
in
``
small
to
medium-size
niche
companies
with
exciting
earnings
prospects
''
--
a
traditional
stomping
ground
for
small
investors
.

This
growth
sector
,
which
usually
carries
a
multiple
about
twice
that
of
the
Standard
&
Poor
's
500
,
happens
to
include
some
of
the
market
's
most
attractive
bargains
right
now
.

``
It
's
now
selling
at
a
multiple
about
even
with
the
market
,
''
says
Mr.
Douglas
.

Moreover
,
Mr.
Douglas
sees
a
revival
of
institutional
interest
in
smaller
growth
stocks
that
could
boost
the
performance
of
these
stocks
in
the
medium
term
.

Many
big
Wall
Street
brokerage
firms
who
eliminated
their
research
effort
in
stocks
of
emerging
growth
companies
a
few
years
ago
are
now
resuming
coverage
of
this
area
,
he
notes
.

``
We
're
seeing
a
real
turnaround
in
interest
in
small
growth
stocks
,
''
he
says
.

The
pros
strenuously
advise
individuals
to
stay
away
from
the
latest
investment
fad
.

They
say
that
's
especially
important
this
late
in
the
growth
phase
of
the
economic
cycle
,
when
there
's
no
robust
bull
market
to
bail
investors
out
of
their
mistakes
.

Friday
's
correction
presents
``
a
pretty
good
buying
opportunity
,
but
let
's
not
speculate
at
this
point
in
the
business
cycle
,
''
says
Carmine
Grigoli
,
chief
equity
portfolio
strategist
at
First
Boston
Corp
.

``
Buy
stocks
on
weakness
for
their
long-term
fundamentals
,
''
he
says
.

In
the
long
run
,
investment
advisers
say
,
most
investors
will
be
better
off
using
the
dollar-cost
averaging
method
of
buying
stocks
.

In
this
method
,
a
person
invests
a
regular
amount
every
month
or
quarter
into
the
stock
market
whether
the
market
is
up
or
down
.

That
cuts
the
risk
,
Mr.
Gregory
,
the
San
Francisco
money
manager
,
points
out
.

``
When
the
market
is
low
,
you
are
buying
more
shares
,
and
when
it
's
high
,
you
're
buying
fewer
shares
,
''
he
says
.

Otherwise
,
if
you
put
all
your
money
in
at
one
time
,
by
sheer
bad
luck
,
you
might
pick
a
terrible
time
,
and
have
to
wait
three
years
to
get
even
,
Mr.
Gregory
says
.

A
disciplined
program
will
work
the
best
,
Mr.
Boesel
says
.

``
One
of
the
hardest
things
to
do
is
to
buy
stocks
when
the
market
is
down
,
''
he
says
.

``
But
that
's
just
the
time
when
you
should
be
buying
them
.

Donald
Trump
,
who
faced
rising
doubt
about
his
bid
for
American
Airlines
parent
AMR
Corp.
even
before
a
United
Airlines
buy-out
came
apart
Friday
,
withdrew
his
$
7.54
billion
offer
.

Separately
,
bankers
representing
the
group
trying
to
buy
United
's
parent
UAL
Corp.
met
with
other
banks
about
reviving
that
purchase
at
a
lower
price
,
possibly
around
$
250
a
share
,
or
$
5.65
billion
.

But
a
lower
bid
could
face
rejection
by
the
UAL
board
.

Mr.
Trump
,
who
vowed
Wednesday
to
``
go
forward
''
with
the
bid
,
said
he
was
dropping
it
``
in
light
of
the
recent
change
in
market
conditions
.

''
He
said
he
might
now
sell
his
AMR
stake
,
buy
more
shares
,
or
make
another
offer
at
a
lower
price
.

The
Manhattan
real-estate
developer
acted
after
the
UAL
buyers
failed
to
obtain
financing
for
their
earlier
$
300-a-share
bid
,
which
sparked
a
selling
panic
among
that
snowballed
into
a
190-point
drop
Friday
in
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
.

News
about
UAL
and
AMR
,
whose
shares
never
reopened
after
trading
was
halted
Friday
for
the
UAL
announcement
,
sent
both
stocks
nosediving
in
composite
trading
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
.

UAL
tumbled
$
56.875
to
$
222.875
on
volume
of
2.3
million
shares
,
and
AMR
declined
by
$
22.125
to
$
76.50
as
4.7
million
shares
changed
hands
.

Together
,
the
two
stocks
wreaked
havoc
among
takeover
stock
traders
,
and
caused
a
7.3
%
drop
in
the
Dow
Jones
Transportation
Average
,
second
in
size
only
to
the
stock-market
crash
of
Oct.
19
,
1987
.

Some
said
Friday
's
market
debacle
had
given
Mr.
Trump
an
excuse
to
bail
out
of
an
offer
that
showed
signs
of
stalling
even
before
problems
emerged
with
the
UAL
deal
.

After
reaching
an
intraday
high
of
$
107.50
the
day
Mr.
Trump
disclosed
his
bid
Oct.
5
,
AMR
's
stock
had
retreated
as
low
as
$
97.75
last
week
.

Some
takeover
stock
traders
had
been
betting
against
Mr.
Trump
because
he
has
a
record
of
disclosing
stakes
in
companies
that
are
potential
takeover
targets
,
then
selling
at
a
profit
without
making
a
bid
.

``
He
still
has
n't
proven
his
mettle
as
a
big-league
take-out
artist
,
''
said
airline
analyst
Kevin
Murphy
of
Morgan
Stanley
&
Co
.

``
He
's
done
this
thing
where
he
'll
buy
a
little
bit
of
a
company
and
then
trade
out
of
it
.

He
's
written
this
book
,
`
The
Art
of
the
Deal
.

'
Why
does
n't
he
just
follow
through
on
one
of
these
things
?
''
Mr.
Trump
withdrew
his
bid
before
the
AMR
board
,
which
is
due
to
meet
tomorrow
,
ever
formally
considered
it
.

AMR
had
weighed
a
wide
range
of
possible
responses
,
from
flat
rejection
to
recapitalizations
and
leveraged
buy-outs
that
might
have
included
either
employees
,
a
friendlier
buyer
such
as
Texas
billionaire
Robert
Bass
,
or
both
.

AMR
had
also
sought
to
foil
Mr.
Trump
in
Congress
by
lobbying
for
legislation
that
would
have
bolstered
the
authority
of
the
Transportation
Department
to
reject
airline
buy-outs
.

Yesterday
,
Mr.
Trump
tried
to
put
the
blame
for
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
deal
on
Congress
,
saying
it
was
rushing
through
a
bill
to
protect
AMR
executives
.

``
I
believe
that
the
perception
that
legislation
in
this
area
may
be
hastily
approved
contributed
to
the
collapse
of
the
UAL
transaction
,
and
the
resulting
disruption
in
the
financial
markets
experienced
this
past
Friday
,
''
Mr.
Trump
wrote
members
of
Congress
.

AMR
declined
to
comment
,
and
Mr.
Trump
did
n't
respond
to
requests
for
interviews
.

Mr.
Trump
never
said
how
much
AMR
stock
he
had
bought
,
only
that
his
holdings
were
``
substantial
.

''
However
,
he
only
received
federal
clearance
to
buy
more
than
$
15
million
of
the
stock
on
Sept.
20
,
when
the
price
rose
$
2
a
share
to
$
78.50
.

Between
then
and
his
bid
on
Oct.
5
,
the
price
fluctuated
between
$
75.625
and
$
87.375
.

In
an
attempt
to
persuade
investors
that
his
bid
was
n't
just
``
a
stock
play
,
''
Mr.
Trump
promised
last
week
to
notify
the
market
before
selling
any
shares
.

AMR
was
trading
at
around
$
84
yesterday
before
his
withdrawal
announcement
,
then
immediately
fell
to
about
$
76
.

Assuming
that
he
paid
a
rough
average
price
of
$
80
a
share
,
and
assuming
he
did
n't
sell
before
his
announcement
reached
the
market
,
Mr.
Trump
could
be
sitting
with
a
modest
loss
with
the
stock
at
$
76.50
.

Some
analysts
said
AMR
Chairman
Robert
Crandall
might
seize
the
opportunity
presented
by
the
stock
price
drop
to
protect
the
nation
's
largest
airline
with
a
defensive
transaction
,
such
as
the
sale
of
stock
to
a
friendly
holder
or
company
employees
.

However
,
other
knowledgeable
observers
said
they
believed
Mr.
Crandall
and
the
AMR
board
might
well
decide
to
tough
it
out
without
taking
any
extra
steps
.

Some
analysts
said
they
believed
Mr.
Trump
,
whose
towering
ego
had
been
viewed
by
some
as
a
reason
to
believe
he
would
n't
back
out
,
might
come
back
with
a
lower
bid
.

Ray
Neidl
of
Dillon
Read
&
Co.
said
Mr.
Trump
``
is
stepping
back
and
waiting
for
the
dust
to
settle
.

I
'm
sure
he
still
wants
AMR
.

''
But
others
remained
skeptical
.

``
I
was
never
sure
Donald
Trump
really
wanted
to
take
AMR
,
''
said
John
Mattis
,
a
bond
analyst
with
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
Inc
.

``
What
happened
with
United
was
a
gracious
way
for
him
to
bow
out
.

''
Mr.
Trump
never
obtained
financing
for
his
bid
.

That
skepticism
would
leave
him
with
an
even
greater
credibility
problem
should
he
return
that
would
handicap
him
in
any
effort
to
oust
the
board
in
a
proxy
fight
.

Meanwhile
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
Manhattan
Corp.
,
the
two
lead
lenders
on
the
UAL
buy-out
,
met
with
other
banks
yesterday
to
determine
if
they
would
be
willing
to
finance
the
buy-out
at
a
lower
price
.

Officials
familiar
with
the
talks
said
Citicorp
had
discussed
lowering
the
offer
to
$
250
a
share
,
but
said
that
price
was
a
talking
point
and
that
no
decision
has
been
made
.

At
$
250
a
share
,
the
group
would
have
to
borrow
about
$
6.1
billion
from
banks
.

The
first
UAL
deal
unraveled
after
Citibank
and
Chase
could
n't
raise
$
7.2
billion
.

Citibank
and
Chase
had
agreed
to
commit
$
3
billion
,
and
said
they
were
``
highly
confident
''
of
raising
another
$
4.2
billion
.

Together
,
Citicorp
and
Chase
received
$
8
million
in
fees
to
raise
the
rest
of
the
financing
.

But
other
banks
balked
at
the
low
interest
rate
and
banking
fees
the
UAL
group
was
willing
to
pay
them
.

Officials
familiar
with
the
bank
talks
said
the
UAL
buy-out
group
--
UAL
pilots
,
management
,
and
British
Airways
PLC
--
is
now
willing
to
pay
higher
bank
fees
and
interest
,
but
is
n't
likely
to
boost
its
$
965
million
equity
contribution
.

Nor
is
the
group
likely
to
come
forward
with
a
revised
offer
within
the
next
48
hours
despite
the
hopes
of
many
traders
.

The
group
's
advisers
want
to
make
certain
they
have
firm
bank
commitments
the
second
time
around
.

Even
if
the
buy-out
group
is
able
to
obtain
financing
,
the
transaction
still
faces
obstacles
.

UAL
's
board
could
reject
the
new
price
as
too
low
,
especially
since
there
are
n't
any
competing
bids
.

Los
Angeles
investor
Marvin
Davis
,
whose
$
275-a-share
offer
was
rejected
by
UAL
's
board
,
has
n't
shown
signs
of
pursuing
a
$
300-a-share
back-up
bid
he
made
last
month
.

In
addition
,
the
coalition
of
labor
and
management
,
longtime
enemies
who
joined
forces
only
under
the
threat
of
Mr.
Davis
's
bid
,
could
break
apart
now
.

The
group
's
resilience
gets
its
first
test
today
when
30
top
pilot
union
leaders
convene
outside
Chicago
in
a
previously
scheduled
meeting
.

Union
Chairman
F.C
.

(
Rick
)
Dubinsky
faces
the
tough
task
of
explaining
why
banks
refused
to
finance
a
buy-out
the
members
approved
overwhelmingly
last
week
.

The
pilot
union
is
vowing
to
pursue
an
acquisition
whatever
the
board
decides
.

But
if
the
board
rejects
a
reduced
bid
and
decides
to
explore
other
alternatives
,
it
could
transform
what
has
been
a
harmonious
process
into
an
adversarial
one
.

The
pilots
could
play
hardball
by
noting
they
are
crucial
to
any
sale
or
restructuring
because
they
can
refuse
to
fly
the
airplanes
.

If
they
were
to
insist
on
a
low
bid
of
,
say
$
200
a
share
,
the
board
might
n't
be
able
to
obtain
a
higher
offer
from
other
bidders
because
banks
might
hesitate
to
finance
a
transaction
the
pilots
oppose
.

Also
,
because
UAL
Chairman
Stephen
Wolf
and
other
UAL
executives
have
joined
the
pilots
'
bid
,
the
board
might
be
forced
to
exclude
him
from
its
deliberations
in
order
to
be
fair
to
other
bidders
.

That
could
cost
him
the
chance
to
influence
the
outcome
and
perhaps
join
the
winning
bidder
.

The
White
House
budget
director
,
prodding
Congress
to
finish
work
quickly
on
1990
budget
bills
,
is
trying
to
put
some
sting
into
the
little-feared
spending
cuts
that
were
triggered
yesterday
under
the
Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction
law
.

To
impose
``
a
little
bit
more
discipline
''
on
the
budget
process
,
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
said
he
wo
n't
give
agencies
much
flexibility
to
shift
funds
among
different
programs
as
a
means
of
coping
with
the
law
's
requirements
.

Some
government
budget
experts
suggested
that
Mr.
Darman
's
maneuver
does
n't
amount
to
much
more
than
tough
talk
.

Nevertheless
,
it
may
add
to
pressure
on
the
House
to
follow
the
Senate
's
lead
and
strip
from
pending
budget
legislation
scores
of
costly
,
extraneous
provisions
.

House
Speaker
Thomas
Foley
met
with
committee
chairmen
yesterday
to
try
to
move
in
that
direction
.

``
We
are
going
to
try
to
make
an
agreement
with
the
Senate
that
the
president
would
sign
,
''
the
Washington
state
Democrat
told
reporters
.

The
talks
are
to
continue
today
.

House
Republicans
also
are
reluctant
to
pare
down
the
1,878-page
measure
--
at
least
until
they
are
guaranteed
that
the
provisions
they
care
about
will
get
another
vote
.

``
A
lot
of
the
guys
...
do
n't
want
it
all
to
just
die
,
''
said
House
GOP
leader
Robert
Michel
(
R.
,
Ill
.

)
.

The
House
did
n't
move
quickly
enough
to
meet
the
Gramm-Rudman
deadline
for
passing
legislation
to
bring
the
projected
fiscal
1990
deficit
below
the
$
110
billion
target
.

As
the
law
requires
,
President
Bush
yesterday
signed
an
order
cutting
federal
spending
across
the
board
by
$
16.1
billion
.

If
removed
from
the
budget
legislation
,
the
extraneous
provisions
in
the
House
bill
--
including
ones
to
cut
capital-gains
taxes
,
provide
new
aid
for
child
care
and
repeal
the
catastrophic-illness
insurance
program
--
could
be
reintroduced
as
separate
bills
.

``
What
we
're
trying
to
explore
now
is
how
to
protect
these
other
issues
,
''
said
House
Budget
Committee
Chairman
Leon
Panetta
(
D.
,
Calif
.

)
.

``
We
're
not
going
to
suddenly
abandon
them
.

''
Reps.
Foley
and
Michel
had
agreed
to
streamline
the
deficit-reduction
bill
before
the
House
even
took
it
up
,
but
Mr.
Darman
and
White
House
Chief
of
Staff
John
Sununu
had
torpedoed
that
plan
in
order
to
press
their
fight
for
a
cut
in
capital-gains
taxes
.

Congressional
leaders
rejected
suggestions
that
their
attempts
to
speed
the
deficit-reduction
bill
had
anything
to
do
with
Friday
's
stock
market
decline
.

``
We
are
responding
to
our
responsibility
under
the
budget
act
,
''
Rep.
Foley
said
.

Even
before
the
size
of
yesterday
's
rebound
in
stock
prices
was
known
,
Mr.
Darman
said
that
Friday
's
plunge
``
would
have
no
significant
effect
on
the
budget
process
.

''
When
the
fiscal
year
began
on
Oct.
1
,
the
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
began
withholding
4.3
%
of
the
Pentagon
's
money
and
5.3
%
of
other
agencies
'
money
,
as
the
Gramm-Rudman
law
requires
.

Those
cuts
,
known
as
a
``
sequester
''
in
budget
jargon
,
became
permanent
yesterday
,
although
Congress
could
cancel
or
rescind
them
whenever
it
wants
to
.

Under
a
special
provision
of
the
law
,
the
government
yesterday
began
slicing
2
%
from
Medicare
payments
made
to
doctors
and
hospitals
.

Nearly
two-thirds
of
all
federal
spending
--
including
Social
Security
payments
and
salaries
of
current
federal
employees
--
is
exempt
from
the
Gramm-Rudman
cuts
.

The
rest
of
the
government
will
be
pinched
,
perhaps
within
a
month
,
if
the
cut
funds
are
n't
restored
.

Taking
a
tough
bargaining
position
,
Mr.
Darman
said
he
opposes
restoring
the
funds
when
Congress
finally
wraps
up
its
work
on
1990
spending
.

The
Gramm-Rudman
penalty
wo
n't
be
taken
seriously
if
agencies
merely
``
figure
out
how
to
juggle
the
accounts
,
trusting
that
Congress
is
going
to
restore
all
the
money
a
little
bit
later
,
''
he
said
.

Congressional
Democrats
were
quick
to
disagree
.

Senate
Budget
Chairman
James
Sasser
(
D.
,
Tenn
.

)
insisted
,
``
We
do
n't
do
the
American
people
any
good
whatsoever
by
standing
by
and
letting
these
automatic
cuts
go
into
effect
.

''
To
quicken
the
pain
that
the
spending
cuts
are
intended
to
inflict
,
Mr.
Darman
said
the
OMB
is
making
the
cuts
from
each
individual
program
,
project
or
activity
in
the
budget
.

Until
yesterday
,
OMB
had
indicated
it
would
cut
at
the
``
account
''
level
;
each
account
is
comprised
of
many
programs
,
projects
or
activities
.

Mr.
Darman
said
the
new
approach
will
give
agencies
``
less
ability
to
shift
from
one
area
to
another
...
to
fudge
over
things
.

''
But
at
least
for
some
major
spending
programs
,
government
budget
experts
said
,
OMB
has
n't
any
significant
control
of
individual
programs
,
projects
or
activities
.

First
to
suffer
from
the
spending
cuts
will
be
programs
that
spend
most
of
their
money
on
personnel
,
Mr.
Darman
said
.

He
would
n't
predict
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
first
layoffs
,
if
any
,
occur
.

Under
the
law
,
President
Bush
may
exempt
military
personnel
accounts
from
the
spending
cuts
.

He
has
n't
yet
done
so
.

Mr.
Darman
also
said
yesterday
that
although
the
administration
is
n't
any
longer
pushing
to
include
a
cut
in
capital-gains
taxes
as
part
of
the
1990
budget
legislation
,
the
odds
are
8-to-5
in
favor
of
winning
approval
for
capital
gains
taxes
this
year
.

E.
Robert
Wallach
,
former
personal
legal
adviser
to
ex-Attorney
General
Edwin
Meese
,
was
sentenced
to
six
years
in
prison
and
fined
$
250,000
for
his
role
in
the
Wedtech
Corp.
scandal
.

Mr.
Wallach
,
55
years
old
,
was
convicted
in
August
of
racketeering
and
conspiring
to
commit
fraud
.

The
charges
involved
$
425,000
in
payments
he
got
from
Wedtech
in
return
for
promising
to
use
his
influence
with
Mr.
Meese
and
other
federal
officials
on
behalf
of
the
now-defunct
defense
contractor
.

Though
Mr.
Wallach
's
attorney
,
Gary
Naftalis
,
described
the
defendant
as
``
a
relatively
minor
player
''
in
the
Wedtech
political-corruption
case
,
U.S.
District
Judge
Richard
Owen
strongly
disagreed
.

At
the
sentencing
in
federal
court
in
New
York
,
Judge
Owen
told
Mr.
Wallach
:
``
You
sold
your
federal
office
and
the
integrity
of
your
federal
office
for
$
300,000
before
you
even
got
the
office
.

''
The
money
was
allegedly
paid
to
Mr.
Wallach
in
anticipation
of
his
being
appointed
to
a
top
position
in
the
Justice
Department
,
but
that
appointment
was
never
made
.

Wedtech
,
a
minority-owned
company
in
New
York
City
's
South
Bronx
,
accounted
for
the
payments
as
consulting
fees
,
though
no
services
were
actually
provided
,
the
government
charged
.

Mr.
Wallach
's
co-defendants
,
W.
Franklyn
Chinn
and
R.
Kent
London
,
were
also
sentenced
.

Mr.
Chinn
,
formerly
a
financial
adviser
to
Mr.
Meese
,
was
sentenced
to
three
years
and
fined
$
100,000
.

Mr.
London
,
who
along
with
Mr.
Chinn
worked
as
a
financial
consultant
to
Wedtech
,
was
sentenced
to
five
years
and
fined
$
250,000
.

The
defendants
,
who
remain
free
on
bail
pending
their
appeals
,
would
have
to
serve
a
third
of
their
sentences
before
being
eligible
for
parole
.

Lawyers
for
the
three
defendants
have
said
they
plan
to
appeal
.

Before
issuing
the
sentences
,
Judge
Owen
criticized
Mr.
Wallach
for
a
host
of
alleged
ethical
and
legal
improprieties
,
some
of
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
Wedtech
case
and
most
of
which
involved
Mr.
Meese
.

The
judge
also
suggested
that
Mr.
Wallach
tried
to
influence
the
jury
in
August
when
the
verdict
was
being
read
.

About
halfway
through
the
verdict
,
Mr.
London
's
mother
had
a
seizure
and
collapsed
in
the
front
row
of
the
courtroom
.

As
court
officers
sought
to
get
help
for
the
woman
,
the
judge
said
,
Mr.
Wallach
``
charged
at
the
jury
and
screamed
,
`
You
see
what
you
have
done
.

'
''
The
judge
said
he
did
n't
understand
why
Mr.
Wallach
,
an
experienced
trial
lawyer
,
would
commit
such
an
outburst
,
but
he
said
Mr.
Wallach
may
have
hoped
the
jury
would
be
unable
to
continue
with
its
verdict
.

After
the
sentencing
,
Mr.
Wallach
blamed
his
Wedtech
woes
on
his
longtime
friendship
with
Mr.
Meese
.

He
said
prosecutors
``
were
looking
for
a
man
between
Ed
Meese
and
Wedtech
...
.

If
they
could
have
gotten
Ed
Meese
that
would
have
been
the
fulfillment
of
the
dreams
.

''
The
defendants
also
face
stiff
forfeiture
penalties
because
they
were
convicted
under
the
Racketeer
Influenced
and
Corrupt
Organizations
law
.

The
judge
ordered
that
the
defendants
turn
over
all
the
money
earned
through
the
racketeering
enterprise
.

For
Mr.
Wallach
,
the
amount
is
$
425,000
.

Mr.
London
must
forfeit
$
99,000
,
and
Mr.
Chinn
must
forfeit
$
20,000
;
together
,
Mr.
Chinn
and
Mr.
London
must
jointly
forfeit
an
additional
$
1.14
million
.

Mr.
Naftalis
said
Mr.
Wallach
had
been
``
financially
devastated
''
by
the
Wedtech
scandal
.

According
to
a
corrected
pre-sentencing
report
,
Mr.
Wallach
currently
has
a
negative
net
worth
of
$
273,000
.

TEAMSTERS
ELECTIONS
will
be
supervised
by
court-appointed
officer
.

U.S.
District
Judge
David
Edelstein
of
New
York
ruled
that
the
elections
officer
will
play
an
extensive
role
in
all
phases
of
the
International
Brotherhood
of
Teamsters
'
1991
election
of
top
union
officials
.

The
government
hailed
the
ruling
as
a
major
victory
in
its
quest
to
achieve
broad
reforms
in
the
union
,
particularly
the
election
of
top
officials
by
the
rank
and
file
.

But
Teamsters
counsel
James
Grady
claimed
that
the
power
bestowed
upon
the
court-appointed
officer
was
a
departure
from
the
terms
of
the
union
's
agreement
with
the
government
earlier
this
year
.

Mr.
Grady
added
that
to
fund
the
type
of
supervision
Judge
Edelstein
described
would
cost
the
union
at
least
$
3.5
million
.

In
March
,
the
Teamsters
agreed
to
a
settlement
of
civil
racketeering
charges
brought
by
the
U.S.
attorney
's
office
in
Manhattan
.

In
its
suit
,
the
government
claimed
organized
crime
figures
had
routinely
picked
top
union
officials
.

Under
the
settlement
terms
,
union
leaders
agreed
that
a
court-appointed
administrator
,
investigator
and
elections
official
would
oversee
union
activities
for
three
years
.

Also
,
the
union
agreed
to
pay
all
expenses
related
to
the
officers
'
oversight
.

But
in
his
first
progress
report
,
filed
two
weeks
ago
,
Administrator
Frederick
B.
Lacey
revealed
some
disagreements
over
the
scope
of
such
oversight
,
the
interpretation
of
the
settlement
,
and
financial
support
.

After
the
judge
's
ruling
,
Mr.
Grady
said
,
``
We
gave
up
our
right
to
a
trial
for
the
terms
of
the
{
agreement
}
,
and
we
believe
that
anything
that
modifies
those
terms
is
completely
inappropriate
.

JUDGE'S
COMMENTS
on
homosexual
murder
victims
are
scrutinized
.

A
special
master
,
appointed
by
the
Texas
Supreme
Court
,
received
evidence
yesterday
about
comments
made
by
Dallas
District
Judge
Jack
Hampton
in
the
wake
of
a
murder
trial
in
December
.

Judge
Hampton
sentenced
the
18-year-old
defendant
to
30
years
in
state
prison
for
killing
two
homosexual
men
in
a
city
park
.

The
judge
was
then
quoted
in
the
Dallas
Times
Herald
as
referring
to
the
victims
as
``
queers
''
and
saying
``
these
guys
would
n't
have
been
killed
if
they
had
n't
been
cruising
the
streets
picking
up
teen-age
boys
.

''
The
comments
touched
off
a
furor
in
the
Dallas
gay
community
and
prompted
several
complaints
about
Judge
Hampton
to
the
State
Commission
on
Judicial
Conduct
.

The
commission
,
which
could
remove
Judge
Hampton
from
the
bench
,
will
act
after
reviewing
findings
to
be
submitted
within
two
weeks
by
special
master
Robert
R.
Murray
of
San
Antonio
.

At
a
hearing
yesterday
,
Judge
Hampton
's
defense
team
,
which
included
former
Dallas
County
District
Attorney
Henry
Wade
and
former
U.S.
Attorney
Jim
Rolfe
,
accused
the
Times
Herald
reporter
of
misquoting
the
judge
.

The
defense
lawyers
also
argued
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
judge
to
consider
whether
the
murder
victims
were
committing
a
crime
at
the
time
they
were
killed
.

But
Bill
Hornung
,
general
counsel
for
the
judicial-conduct
commission
,
said
the
defense
team
was
sidestepping
the
focus
of
the
inquiry
--
whether
Judge
Hampton
violated
judicial
ethics
by
commenting
to
the
public
while
a
motion
for
new
trial
was
pending
.

``
The
place
where
a
judge
can
comment
and
explain
his
rationale
{
for
sentencing
}
is
from
the
bench
...
not
in
the
privacy
of
a
little
impromptu
press
conference
,
''
Mr.
Hornung
said
.

SENATE
JUDICIARY
COMMITTEE
gets
legislation
to
limit
death-penalty
appeals
.

Sen.
Joseph
Biden
(
D.
,
Del.
)
,
committee
chairman
,
proposed
legislation
that
would
carry
out
the
streamlining
of
death-penalty
appeals
in
federal
court
that
was
proposed
last
month
by
a
special
task
force
appointed
by
Chief
Justice
of
the
U.S.
William
Rehnquist
.

Sen.
Biden
proposed
the
legislation
to
comply
with
a
law
passed
last
year
requiring
the
Senate
to
expedite
consideration
of
proposals
made
by
the
task
force
,
led
by
retired
Supreme
Court
Justice
Lewis
Powell
.

The
task
force
proposed
that
states
provide
lawyers
to
death-row
inmates
for
civil
,
post-conviction
lawsuits
,
called
habeas
corpus
cases
,
in
which
they
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
their
convictions
.

In
exchange
,
the
number
of
such
lawsuits
each
inmate
may
file
would
be
sharply
curtailed
,
allowing
states
greater
certainty
of
being
able
to
execute
those
on
death
row
.

When
Chief
Justice
Rehnquist
sent
the
report
to
Congress
,
a
majority
of
federal
judges
on
the
policy-making
Judicial
Conference
complained
they
had
n't
been
given
a
chance
to
consider
the
recommendations
.

The
legislation
introduced
by
Sen.
Biden
adopts
the
same
approach
as
the
Powell
report
:
state-provided
lawyers
,
in
exchange
for
limiting
appeals
.

But
the
senator
's
bill
eases
a
number
of
the
restrictions
.

Leslie
Harris
,
an
American
Civil
Liberties
Union
spokeswoman
criticized
the
Powell
proposals
,
but
said
the
Biden
legislation
is
``
a
more
moderate
,
thoughtful
approach
,
''
although
the
group
will
likely
oppose
it
.

APPLE

Inc.
's
former
general
counsel
John
P.
Karalis
joined
the
Phoenix

&

Mr.

A
surge
in
sales
in
August
helped
trim
inventory
levels
of
U.S.
businesses
,
Commerce
Department
figures
show
.

Sales
at
factories
,
retailers
and
wholesalers
jumped
3.1
%
in
August
,
the
department
reported
,
far
outstripping
a
0.3
%
climb
in
inventories
.

As
a
result
,
inventories
fell
back
to
the
equivalent
of
1.5
months
of
sales
.

Inventories
had
been
running
at
about
this
level
--
one
that
economists
regard
as
manageable
--
for
much
of
the
year
before
they
jumped
to
1.54
months
in
July
.

The
numbers
are
reassuring
news
for
the
economy
.

If
goods
on
shelves
and
backlots
pile
up
too
high
,
retailers
often
cut
back
on
orders
and
factories
on
production
.

The
chain
reaction
can
lead
to
layoffs
and
ultimately
a
recession
.

In
July
,
business
inventories
had
climbed
0.9
%
,
a
number
the
department
revised
from
its
initial
report
of
0.6
%
.

Sales
,
meanwhile
,
dropped
0.9
%
.

In
August
,
business
inventories
totaled
$
789.87
billion
,
while
sales
grew
to
$
526.79
billion
,
the
department
said
.

Manufacturers
showed
the
biggest
sales
gains
;
their
sales
rose
5.6
%
,
while
factory
inventories
only
grew
0.3
%
.

Retailers
'
sales
increased
0.7
%
,
as
did
their
inventories
.

Wholesalers
'
sales
climbed
1.5
%
,
while
their
inventories
dropped
0.1
%
.

Here
is
a
summary
of
the
Commerce
Department
's
report
on
business
inventories
and
sales
in
in
August
.

The
figures
are
in
billions
of
dollars
,
seasonally
adjusted
:
Pall
Corp.
said
it
expects
a
reduction
in
net
income
for
the
first
quarter
ended
Oct.
28
of
about
$
2
million
,
or
five
cents
a
share
,
as
a
result
of
Hurricane
Hugo
.

The
maker
of
disposable
filters
said
revenue
will
be
reduced
about
$
3
million
because
of
damage
done
by
the
hurricane
to
the
company
's
three
plants
in
Puerto
Rico
.

In
the
year-earlier
quarter
,
Pall
had
net
of
$
8.3
million
,
or
22
cents
a
share
,
on
revenue
of
$
100.5
million
.

The
bulls
are
back
in
the
art-auction
china
shops
,
predicting
higher
prices
and
higher
volume
than
ever
before
.

Christie
's
and
Sotheby
's
,
the
two
major
New
York
houses
,
are
about
to
offer
a
large
number
of
impressionist
and
modern
paintings
at
estimates
unheard
of
even
five
years
ago
.

They
are
betting
that
demand
for
these
pictures
will
be
so
strong
that
the
market
will
swallow
everything
that
is
thrown
at
it
and
prices
still
will
rise
--
a
lot
.

As
art
dealer
Richard
Feigen
sees
it
,
``
There
is
unlimited
money
trying
to
absorb
itself
in
art
.

''
Step
right
this
way
.

More
than
$
600
million
of
impressionist
and
modern
paintings
are
about
to
hit
the
New
York
auction
block
--
far
outstripping
May
's
four-day
$
400
million
bonanza
.

This
season
Lorinda
de
Roulet
(
sister
of
John
Whitney
Payson
,
for
whom
``
Irises
''
by
Vincent
van
Gogh
was
sold
for
$
53.9
million
in
November
of
1987
,
to
the
Australian
Alan
Bond
,
who
still
has
n't
taken
possession
because
he
has
n't
yet
paid
off
the
loan
Sotheby
's
offered
him
at
the
sale
)
has
consigned
another
biggie
to
Sotheby
's
.

``
Au
Lapin
Agile
''
is
a
1905
Rose
Period
Picasso
being
billed
as
``
the
most
important
20th-century
picture
ever
to
come
up
for
auction
.

''
It
may
sell
for
more
than
any
previous
Picasso
--
the
record
is
$
47.85
million
set
in
May
for
``
Self
Portrait
:
Yo
Picasso
.

''
Sotheby
's
also
weighs
in
with
the
John
T.
Dorrance
Jr.
collection
of
impressionists
at
an
estimated
$
100
million-plus
(
to
be
offered
tomorrow
)
and
a
juicy
assortment
of
paintings
from
other
sources
,
more
than
35
of
which
are
expected
to
sell
in
November
for
at
least
$
1
million
each
.

Christie
's
has
snagged
the
15
impressionist
and
modern
paintings
being
pruned
from
Paul
Mellon
's
vast
collection
,
including
the
probable
$
30
million-plus
``
Rue
Mosnier
,
Paris
,
Decorated
With
Flags
on
June
30
,
1878
''
by
Edouard
Manet
(
purchased
by
Mellon
at
the
Jacob
Goldschmidt
sale
in
London
in
1958
for
$
316,400
)
and
a
van
Gogh
,
``
Trunk
of
an
Old
Yew
Tree
,
Arles
,
''
estimated
at
$
25
million-plus
.

Other
one-owner
collections
include
Billy
Wilder
's
more
modest
but
choice
offerings
,
and
the
George
N.
Richard
collection
--
piled
on
top
of
Christie
's
estimated
$
150
million
--
$
200
million
of
other
impressionist
goodies
.

All
these
will
go
under
the
hammer
on
Nov.
13
and
14
.

``
A
strong
art
market
is
bringing
out
paintings
I
never
expected
to
see
on
the
market
,
''
says
David
Nash
,
director
of
Sotheby
's
Fine
Arts
Division
.

Some
museum
directors
never
expected
to
see
them
there
either
.

But
since
the
1986
tax
laws
drastically
reduced
deductions
for
the
donation
of
appreciated
property
and
reduced
overall
tax
rates
(
thereby
making
deductions
less
significant
)
,
charitable
donations
to
museums
,
when
anyone
makes
them
,
are
very
charitable
indeed
.

And
given
the
seductive
prices
held
out
by
the
auction
houses
,
the
urge
to
sell
can
--
and
apparently
has
--
become
irresistible
.

Of
the
current
group
of
paintings
,
it
's
hard
to
say
which
,
in
the
days
before
tax
reform
,
might
have
been
donated
instead
of
sold
.

No
museum
director
will
risk
offending
potential
patrons
by
publicly
airing
disappointed
hopes
.

Philadelphia
Museum
head
Anne
d'Harnoncourt
insists
that
even
though
John
Dorrance
may
have
been
the
chairman
of
her
Board
of
Trustees
,
``
We
were
n't
expecting
the
pictures
we
did
n't
get
.

''
Although
Sotheby
's
points
out
that
it
is
``
an
international
organization
''
not
specifically
concerned
with
potential
losses
to
American
museums
,
others
are
up
in
arms
:
``
Donations
have
always
been
the
main
source
of
increased
museum
collections
,
''
says
Edward
H.
Able
Jr.
,
executive
director
of
the
American
Association
of
Museums
.

``
Now
there
is
a
hemorrhaging
of
this
country
's
patrimony
.

''
According
to
a
study
conducted
by
the
Association
of
Art
Museum
Directors
,
the
drop
in
the
dollar
value
of
donated
works
of
art
since
1986
is
more
than
50
%
.

``
This
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
,
because
no
major
collector
has
died
recently
,
''
says
Christopher
Burge
,
president
of
Christie
's
America
.

``
The
next
10
years
are
going
to
be
a
wasteland
for
American
museums
.

''
But
not
for
auction
houses
.

Their
sales
have
turned
into
theater
for
a
world
audience
.

Even
before
the
sales
,
the
hoopla
is
well
under
way
.

Major
attractions
have
out-of-town
tryouts
.

``
Au
Lapin
Agile
,
''
some
of
the
Mellon
paintings
,
and
others
went
around
the
world
on
a
series
of
whistle-stop
exhibition
tours
;
Billy
Wilder
's
pictures
went
to
a
party
at
the
Beverly
Hills
Hotel
;
and
the
Dorrance
paintings
hung
for
five
days
in
the
Philadelphia
Museum
of
Art
.

(
Even
Sotheby
's
PR
department
could
n't
have
pulled
that
one
off
;
Dorrance
's
executors
``
requested
''
it
.

)
At
last
,
however
,
the
warmup
is
done
and
the
action
is
about
to
begin
.

And
it
will
soon
be
clear
whether
enough
people
will
be
raising
those
little
bidding
paddles
,
no
matter
what
the
cost
.

The
weak
dollar
makes
our
market
a
playground
for
foreign
bidders
,
and
our
sorry
balance
of
trade
has
given
them
plenty
of
dollars
to
play
with
.

``
In
many
ways
the
Japanese
--
particularly
Japanese
corporations
--
dictate
art
price
levels
,
''
says
Susan
Seidel
of
William
Beadleston
,
a
New
York
private
dealing
concern
.

``
They
are
willing
to
pay
almost
anything
.

''
But
why
art
?
Are
we
talking
pure
aesthetic
appreciation
here
?
For
many
buyers
,
that
still
is
major
motivation
.

But
the
stakes
are
now
very
high
and
for
your
$
40
million
you
can
buy
only
the
best
of
what
is
available
--
which
may
not
be
the
best
there
is
.

But
at
least
the
auction
process
illustrates
so
beautifully
that
everybody
else
wanted
to
have
it
too
.

For
some
,
the
social
status
that
can
be
acquired
in
this
way
is
the
point
of
the
game
.

``
They
buy
the
co-op
,
they
buy
the
cars
,
''
says
Ms.
Seidel
.

``
Then
they
buy
`
brand
names
'
like
Picasso
to
put
on
the
wall
.

''
But
at
these
price
levels
,
confidence
in
the
``
investment
''
potential
of
major
paintings
must
be
playing
a
part
in
fueling
the
collecting
frenzy
.

Big-bucks
buyers
trust
that
the
market
will
continue
its
strong
surge
.

``
In
October
of
'87
people
saw
that
everything
else
went
down
but
art
went
up
,
''
Desmond
Corcoran
of
London
's
Alex
Reid
&
Lefevre
Ltd.
gallery
points
out
.

Since
then
,
the
market
has
continued
to
rise
,
but
now
the
size
of
the
estimates
seems
to
be
making
some
people
nervous
.

``
Zey
are
crazee
!
''
shrieked
one
French
dealer
,
reeling
from
auction
estimate
sticker
shock
.

In
a
lower
key
,
Mr.
Corcoran
finds
the
world
``
full
of
strange
speculators
''
and
the
auction
estimates
``
incredible
,
''
and
suggests
the
Dorrance
sale
as
a
sort
of
early
warning
system
:
``
These
pictures
are
not
absolutely
top
quality
,
''
he
says
.

``
So
if
the
market
absorbs
those
,
what
comes
three
weeks
later
will
do
just
fine
.

''
If
all
goes
well
,
if
the
Picasso
hits
$
75
million
,
and
Mellon
,
Dorrance
,
Wilder
and
the
rest
get
what
they
bargained
for
,
the
uncomfortable
,
questioning
buzz
in
the
art
marketplace
will
trail
off
into
sighs
of
relief
,
only
to
begin
anew
slightly
louder
than
before
,
as
the
cycle
starts
over
in
the
spring
.

Because
for
some
,
the
art
market
has
become
a
sort
of
magic
beanstalk
rising
into
the
clouds
at
a
cartoon
rate
of
speed
.

Nobody
knows
what
is
at
the
top
,
but
they
are
hoping
it
is
very
far
away
.

Ms.
Berman
covers
the
auction
scene
.

Motorola
Inc.
said
it
will
sell
its
Tegal
Corp.
unit
to
a
Tegal
management
group
for
a
sum
that
was
n't
disclosed
.

A
spokesman
for
the
maker
of
electronic
equipment
and
semiconductors
said
Motorola
does
n't
expect
the
transaction
to
have
a
material
impact
on
earnings
.

Tegal
,
a
Petaluma
,
Calif.
,
supplier
to
the
semiconductor
industry
,
has
annual
sales
of
about
$
55
million
.

While
investors
were
keeping
a
close
eye
on
stock-market
indicators
yesterday
,
securities
regulators
focused
on
Wall
Street
's
back
offices
to
ensure
that
customer
funds
were
safe
.

Securities
and
Exchange
Commission
officials
said
they
called
heads
of
firms
,
traders
and
other
brokerage
staffers
to
make
sure
the
houses
had
enough
capital
and
back-office
resources
to
handle
the
crush
of
sell
orders
during
the
first
few
hours
of
trading
yesterday
.

``
We
're
very
concerned
about
the
financial
well-being
of
the
firms
,
''
said
Martin
Kuperberg
,
who
runs
the
SEC
's
New
York
broker-dealer
unit
.

``
We
've
spoken
to
a
number
of
people
both
at
the
{
exchanges
}
and
at
the
firms
.

''
Meanwhile
,
SEC
officials
in
Washington
held
a
series
of
discussions
with
officials
from
the
Treasury
,
the
Federal
Reserve
,
the
exchanges
,
the
Commodity
Futures
Trading
Commission
and
the
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
to
see
whether
market
mechanisms
were
working
properly
.

In
his
first
statement
since
the
recent
market
gyrations
began
,
Richard
Breeden
,
who
was
sworn
in
as
SEC
chairman
last
week
,
said
the
``
markets
'
trading
and
order
routing
systems
generally
operated
quite
smoothly
.

Today
's
developments
demonstrate
the
value
of
the
significant
improvements
that
have
been
made
in
trading
systems
over
the
past
two
years
.

''
Back
offices
are
the
huge
,
behind-the-scenes
operations
that
support
the
brokerages
'
sales
and
trading
departments
.

Key
back-office
functions
are
to
organize
and
maintain
securities
owned
by
a
firm
and
its
customers
and
to
monitor
the
firm
's
capital
position
.

The
default
of
several
Wall
Street
houses
that
ran
short
of
liquidity
during
the
1987
crash
is
a
fresh
memory
for
regulators
and
the
exchanges
.

So
the
SEC
recently
renewed
its
attacks
on
firms
that
violate
back-office
regulations
.

Two
weeks
ago
,
for
example
,
the
agency
censured
Prudential
Insurance
Co.
of
America
's
Prudential-Bache
Securities
Inc.
for
failing
to
adequately
keep
track
of
customers
'
funds
.

The
move
was
in
part
a
warning
to
firms
that
the
SEC
will
try
to
crack
down
on
firms
if
their
back
offices
are
n't
in
order
and
become
a
danger
in
the
event
of
a
major
market
move
.

``
It
notifies
the
broker-dealer
community
that
we
wo
n't
tolerate
this
kind
of
action
,
''
Mr.
Kuperberg
said
.

Separately
,
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
dispatched
25
examiners
into
brokerages
'
trading
rooms
to
make
sure
brokers
were
answering
phones
and
handling
customer
orders
properly
.

Two
years
ago
,
many
market
makers
refused
to
answer
their
phones
,
creating
frustration
and
losses
among
investors
looking
to
sell
stocks
.

``
The
market-making
firms
responded
pretty
well
,
''
said
Joseph
Hardiman
,
Nasdaq
president
.

``
We
've
had
little
to
no
complaints
.

''
Storage
Technology
Corp.
said
it
signed
a
letter
of
intent
to
acquire
M4
Data
Inc.
of
Britain
.

Terms
were
n't
disclosed
.

Storage
Technology
said
M4
's
magnetic
tape
storage
equipment
will
complement
its
tape
cartridge
products
.

M4
sells
to
the
original
equipment
manufacturer
market
world-wide
and
has
about
$
20
million
in
annual
sales
.

A
Storage
Technology
spokesman
said
the
transaction
should
be
completed
in
one
to
two
months
.

Being
the
No.
2
newspaper
in
town
just
got
tougher
.

The
Dallas
Morning
News
,
the
No.
1
paper
in
town
,
has
secured
exclusive
rights
here
to
Universal
Press
Syndicate
's
features
,
including
26
previously
carried
by
its
struggling
rival
,
the
Dallas
Times
Herald
.

The
News
agreed
to
pay
a
minimum
of
$
100,000
annually
for
five
years
for
the
features
,
and
an
unusual
$
500,000
fee
,
mostly
up
front
,
to
keep
all
current
and
future
Universal
offerings
for
itself
in
the
Dallas
area
.

The
move
was
a
stunning
coup
,
nabbing
some
of
the
Times
Herald
's
biggest
draws
,
including
``
Dear
Abby
,
''
``
Doonesbury
,
''
Erma
Bombeck
's
column
and
``
The
Far
Side
.

''
It
also
reignited
a
long-running
newspaper
war
that
had
cooled
last
year
after
closely
held
DTH
Media
Inc.
bought
the
Times
Herald
.

Universal
argues
that
special
circumstances
led
to
the
agreement
.

But
if
the
syndicate
's
contract
with
the
Morning
News
survives
the
Times
Herald
's
court
challenge
,
other
second-place
newspapers
worry
that
they
,
too
,
may
see
their
best
features
snatched
away
by
bigger
,
wealthier
rivals
.

``
We
're
very
concerned
,
''
says
Tom
King
,
the
editor
and
president
of
the
El
Paso
Herald-Post
,
a
Scripps
Howard
newspaper
that
competes
with
a
Gannett
Corp.
paper
.

``
It
certainly
looks
like
it
could
lead
to
bidding
wars
.

''
One
effect
,
syndicate
executives
say
,
is
that
some
newspapers
in
competing
markets
are
considering
seeking
long-term
contracts
for
their
favorite
features
instead
of
the
usual
pacts
that
let
the
syndicate
cancel
with
30
to
90
days
'
notice
.

For
smaller
newspapers
,
syndicated
features
can
be
crucial
.

Industry
executives
say
the
columns
and
cartoons
give
newspapers
consistency
and
build
fierce
reader
loyalty
.

``
I
have
people
tell
me
that
Garfield
is
the
only
reason
they
read
the
{
Arkansas
}
Gazette
,
''
says
Walter
E.
Hussman
,
the
publisher
of
the
competing
Arkansas
Democrat
.

Syndicates
have
traditionally
turned
down
fatter
fees
from
competitors
,
switching
only
when
a
newspaper
dropped
a
feature
or
some
unusual
ownership
change
occurred
.

In
1984
,
the
Boston
Herald
stole
about
10
features
from
the
bigger
Boston
Globe
,
but
only
after
the
Herald
's
owner
,
Rupert
Murdoch
,
bought
the
features
'
syndicator
.

In
1977
,
Universal
pulled
its
features
from
the
now-defunct
Philadelphia
Bulletin
because
of
a
contract
dispute
and
because
``
there
was
no
growth
{
there
}
for
Universal
,
''
says
John
McMeel
,
president
and
co-owner
of
Universal
.

Growth
was
also
a
consideration
in
Dallas
.

The
Times
Herald
's
circulation
had
been
slipping
for
several
years
,
and
its
audited
daily
circulation
now
stands
at
222,000
,
compared
with
the
Morning
News
's
370,000
.

But
the
main
reason
for
the
move
,
Mr.
McMeel
says
,
is
a
joint
venture
between
Universal
and
A.H.
Belo
Corp.
,
the
Morning
News
's
parent
and
the
owner
of
five
television
stations
.

Plans
call
for
the
two
to
explore
TV
programming
drawn
from
the
syndicate
's
and
others
'
characters
,
as
well
as
to
develop
TV
ads
for
newspapers
using
Universal
's
characters
.

Universal
says
that
it
wanted
all
its
creators
to
share
in
the
television
venture
and
Belo
would
n't
promote
features
appearing
in
its
competition
.

Belo
declined
comment
,
citing
the
litigation
.

The
Times
Herald
charges
that
the
venture
is
a
smokescreen
,
created
to
hide
the
News
's
plan
to
buy
the
features
away
.

``
We
're
very
skeptical
of
a
venture
in
which
no
one
has
invested
a
dollar
,
in
which
no
one
has
any
experience
in
syndicating
animated
features
and
game
shows
and
for
which
there
was
not
prior
{
market
}
research
,
''
says
Roy
E.
Bode
,
the
Times
Herald
's
editor
.

Some
syndicate
executives
apparently
prefer
not
to
discuss
the
episode
in
public
.

Willard
Colston
,
chairman
of
the
Los
Angeles
Times
Syndicate
and
program
director
of
the
National
Features
Council
,
wanted
the
group
to
sponsor
a
panel
discussion
on
the
pact
at
its
annual
meeting
in
Dallas
last
week
.

Initially
a
majority
of
the
directors
,
made
up
of
syndicate
executives
,
editors
,
cartoonists
and
columnists
,
supported
the
idea
.

But
Universal
's
Mr.
McMeel
,
the
council
's
president
,
asked
directors
to
reconsider
,
and
they
voted
down
the
discussion
13-12
,
Mr.
Colston
says
.

Meanwhile
,
the
Times
Herald
is
just
hoping
to
survive
this
latest
blow
.

A
Houston
state
district
judge
refused
to
enjoin
the
syndicate
from
moving
the
features
,
and
the
Morning
News
began
running
most
of
them
a
few
weeks
ago
.

A
trial
on
breach
of
contract
and
antitrust
charges
is
n't
expected
for
a
few
months
.

Mr.
Bode
acknowledges
that
some
subscriptions
have
been
canceled
.

The
Universal-Morning
News
deal
also
troubles
syndicated
writers
and
artists
,
who
fear
that
they
wo
n't
get
their
cut
from
this
new
type
of
exclusivity
payment
.

(
Creators
of
syndicated
features
generally
receive
about
half
the
fee
a
newspaper
pays
for
their
work
.

)
Mr.
McMeel
says
some
of
the
exclusivity
payment
fee
will
be
used
for
future
development
of
features
and
promises
that
those
whose
work
appears
in
the
Morning
News
will
see
``
substantial
immediate
increases
''
in
pay
.

But
he
concedes
that
they
have
n't
been
notified
yet
.

The
uncertainty
already
has
some
in
the
business
plotting
new
strategy
.

Arnold
Schwartzman
,
a
Dayton
,
Ohio
,
lawyer
who
has
represented
about
50
writers
and
artists
,
says
that
any
new
contract
or
renewal
he
negotiates
will
require
that
special
payments
be
shared
with
his
clients
.

``
It
's
not
something
I
'm
considering
;
it
'll
become
part
of
my
boilerplate
,
''
he

Insurance-industry
consultant
Benjamin
Zycher
's
attack
on
Proposition
103
,
the
landmark
insurance-reform
initiative
approved
by
Californians
last
November
(
``
Insurance
Fraud
,
California
Style
,
''
Oct.
9
)
is
much
like
the
industry
's
unsuccessful
$
80
million
campaign
against
the
measure
:
distorted
and
often
dishonest
.

Prop
103
eliminates
many
barriers
to
competition
in
the
industry
,
including
the
insurers
'
unjustified
exemption
from
the
antitrust
laws
.

Insurers
are
permitted
to
share
some
historical-claims
data
in
order
to
enhance
the
competitiveness
of
small
companies
.

Mr.
Zycher
says
the
industry
does
n't
need
the
exemption
;
if
that
's
so
,
why
do
its
lobbyists
so
bitterly
oppose
state
and
federal
efforts
to
eliminate
it
?
Mr.
Zycher
also
criticizes
103
's
requirement
that
auto-insurance
rates
be
based
primarily
on
a
motorist
's
safety
record
and
driving
habits
rather
than
upon
zip
code
.

Proposition
103
does
not
prohibit
any
use
of
territorial
rating
,
but
requires
insurers
to
justify
it
scientifically
.

So
far
,
they
've
been
unable
to
do
so
.

The
most
controversial
provision
of
103
requires
a
20
%
rollback
in
all
auto
,
home
and
business
liability
premiums
to
offset
excessive
rates
--
the
product
of
years
of
lax
regulation
and
insulation
from
competition
.

Mr.
Zycher
quotes
me
as
saying
something
I
never
said
--
that
the
20
%
figure
was
arbitrary
and
hence
the
rollback
unjustified
.

In
fact
,
simply
using
the
insurers
own
self-serving
profitability
standards
,
the
California
Insurance
Commissioner
--
an
opponent
of
103
--
has
already
called
for
more
than
$
800
million
in
rollbacks
.

Hearings
to
begin
this
month
will
allow
us
to
introduce
evidence
of
the
industry
's
inflated
reserves
,
excess
surplus
,
gross
waste
and
inefficiency
that
will
justify
more
than
a
20
%
rollback
.

Insurance-reform
efforts
are
under
way
in
35
states
.

Like
Mr.
Zycher
,
the
industry
's
response
is
to
make
war
against
the
reformers
.

But
until
the
industry
acknowledges
the
reality
that
reform
is
necessary
,
it
will
remain
its
own
worst
enemy
.

Harvey

The
nine
major
domestic
auto
makers
plan
to
build
10.4
%
fewer
cars
in
this
year
's
fourth
quarter
than
they
built
a
year
ago
,
with
the
Big
Three
accounting
for
nearly
all
of
the
decline
.

Continuing
a
trend
that
is
putting
intense
pressure
on
General
Motors
Corp.
,
Ford
Motor
Co.
and
Chrysler
Corp.
,
output
at
Japanese-owned
and
managed
plants
will
rise
42
%
from
year-earlier
levels
to
an
estimated
296,187
cars
.

Production
at
Big
Three
plants
is
forecast
to
fall
17
%
to
1,402,000
cars
.

Some
of
the
decline
at
the
Big
Three
is
production
shifted
to
the
``
transplants
''
:
Diamond-Star
Motors
Corp.
builds
cars
sold
by
Chrysler
as
well
as
Mitsubishi
Motors
Corp
.

Mazda
Motor
Corp.
's
U.S.
plant
builds
cars
for
its
own
and
Ford
dealers
.

New
United
Motor
Manufacturing
Inc.
supplies
GM
's
Chevrolet
and
Toyota
Motor
Corp.
's
U.S.
dealer
networks
.

The
only
transplants
to
drop
below
1988
levels
are
owned
by
Mazda
and
Honda
Motor
Co
.

Part
of
the
Mazda
decline
reflects
``
trying
to
anticipate
what
sales
''
are
going
to
be
,
said
a
spokesman
.

Mazda
also
is
adding
the
Mazda
626
car
at
its
Flat
Rock
,
Mich.
,
plant
,
slowing
output
.

Honda
is
accelerating
production
after
retooling
its
Marysville
,
Ohio
,
plant
to
build
the
redesigned
Accord
.

The
overall
decline
in
car
production
is
matched
by
an
almost
equal
drop
of
10.6
%
in
expected
truck
output
at
GM
,
Ford
,
Chrysler
and
Nissan
Motor
Corp
.

Car
and
truck
sales
are
expected
to
soften
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
from
unusually
high
,
incentive-buoyed
levels
in
August
and
September
.

``
None
of
it
is
a
surprise
,
''
said
Edward
Sullivan
,
vice
president
of
automotive
consulting
at
the
WEFA
Group
,
a
market
analysis
firm
in
Bala
Cynwyd
,
Pa
.

``
Strong
third-quarter
sales
stole
from
fourth-quarter
sales
.

''
He
said
schedules
at
GM
,
in
particular
,
are
still
too
high
given
market
expectations
,
which
will
likely
mean
some
trimming
.

But
``
if
the
cuts
are
going
to
come
,
they
'll
have
to
come
pretty
soon
,
''
he
added
.

``
Once
you
get
into
November
there
's
not
a
whole
lot
of
flexibility
.

''
The
recent
gyrations
in
the
stock
market
did
n't
have
any
immediate
impact
on
the
auto
makers
'
schedules
.

``
Based
on
the
minimal
impact
that
the
1987
event
had
on
car
sales
,
this
little
hiccup
is
unlikely
to
have
any
influence
,
''
said
a
Ford
spokesman
.

Here
are
industry
forecasts
for
the
fourth
quarter
:
Much
of
the
difference
in
Chrysler
's
car
output
compared
with
a
year
ago
comes
from
having
two
fewer
plants
;
Chrysler
's
now-shuttered
facilities
in
Kenosha
,
Wis.
,
turned
out
51,000
subcompacts
and
mid-size
cars
in
the
1988
fourth-quarter
before
it
closed
in
December
.

More
than
half
the
decline
in
Ford
's
expected
car
output
comes
from
closing
its
Escort
plant
in
Wayne
,
Mich.
,
as
of
Nov.
22
to
prepare
for
production
of
the
next
generation
of
the
popular
subcompact
.

The
plant
wo
n't
reopen
until
late
February
or
early
March
,
the
company
spokesman
said
.

The
lower
output
will
likely
mean
the
subcompacts
will
lose
for
the
first
time
since
the
1985
model
year
their
distinction
as
the
best-selling
car
in
the
U.S
.

Honda
's
Accord
,
made
in
the
U.S.
and
Japan
,
was
a
close
second
to
Escort
in
the
just-ended
1989
model
year
.

If
Accord
were
to
top
the
list
in
1990
,
it
would
be
the
first
vehicle
from
a
foreign
auto
maker
ever
to
hold
that
spot
.

BRIDGEPORT

Christopher
Kimball
,
founder
,
president
and
publisher
of
Cook
's
magazine
,
said
he
is
leaving
the
magazine
by
year
end
to
launch
a
new
men
's
consumer
magazine
.

The
new
magazine
,
whose
name
Mr.
Kimball
wo
n't
reveal
,
will
be
a
service
magazine
``
at
its
core
,
''
covering
subjects
such
as
health
,
clothing
,
food
,
travel
and
gifts
for
women
.

Mr.
Kimball
said
he
will
launch
the
magazine
as
a
bi-monthly
in
September
1990
with
250,000
circulation
.

Mr.
Kimball
said
he
will
be
a
partner
in
the
magazine
with
an
``
experienced
''
editor
,
whose
name
will
be
revealed
later
.

Mr.
Kimball
started
Cook
's
,
a
glossy
epicurean
magazine
,
in
1979
and
it
was
purchased
in
1983
by
the
New
Yorker
Magazine
.

The
New
Yorker
's
parent
,
Advance
Publications
Inc.
,
sold
it
to
Sweden
's
Bonnier
Magazine
Group
in
1986
.

The
magazine
is
now
published
by
Pennington
Publishing
,
a
subsidiary
of
Bonnier
based
in
Bridgeport
,
Conn
.

It
has
200,000
circulation
.

As
stocks
recovered
,
the
U.S.
dollar
rebounded
,
but
bond
prices
plunged
and
Treasury
bill
rates
soared
.

The
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
's
88.12-point
bounce
back
from
Friday
's
190-point
dive
helped
calm
investor
fears
of
a
financial
Armageddon
.

However
,
gold
prices
rose
despite
the
dollar
's
resilience
,
reflecting
continued
nervousness
about
the
markets
'
manic
behavior
.

Early
yesterday
,
strategists
at
several
investment
firms
,
including
Merrill
Lynch
and
Dean
Witter
Reynolds
,
urged
customers
to
buy
stocks
and
cut
back
on
bonds
.

Treasury
bond
prices
dropped
the
most
for
any
single
day
in
more
than
two
months
.

The
30-year
bond
lost
1
points
,
or
$
17.50
for
each
$
1,000
face
amount
.

Treasury
bill
rates
,
which
fell
nearly
three-quarters
of
a
percentage
point
Friday
as
investors
sought
a
safe
haven
from
plunging
stocks
,
jumped
more
than
half
a
percentage
point
yesterday
.

``
Investors
had
expected
the
worst
from
the
stock
market
,
and
so
they
piled
into
government
bonds
last
Friday
,
''
said
Steven
Einhorn
,
chairman
of
the
investment
policy
committee
at
Goldman
,
Sachs
&
Co
.

``
But
when
we
did
n't
get
the
worst
,
there
was
some
movement
out
of
bonds
and
back
into
stocks
''
yesterday
.

Mr.
Einhorn
early
yesterday
told
Goldman
traders
and
salesmen
that
he
recommends
investors
increase
their
stock
holdings
.

Speculation
that
the
Federal
Reserve
stands
ready
to
act
as
a
safety
net
for
the
financial
system
helped
restore
investor
confidence
yesterday
,
said
Mitchell
Shivers
,
president
of
Kleinwort
Benson
Government
Securities
Inc
.

Many
investment
managers
expect
the
Fed
to
ease
credit
further
in
coming
weeks
to
bolster
the
economy
.

In
major
market
activity
:
Bond
prices
plummeted
,
reversing
Friday
's
big
gains
.

The
yield
on
the
Treasury
's
benchmark
30-year
issue
rose
to
7.97
%
.

The
dollar
bounced
back
in
the
currency
markets
.

In
New
York
very
late
yesterday
,
it
was
quoted
at
141.80
Japanese
yen
and
1.8685
West
German
marks
,
up
from
141.50
yen
and
1.8655
marks
late
Friday
.

Despite
turmoil
created
by
a
costly
S&L
bailout
and
the
growing
realization
that
a
government
guarantee
may
become
a
taxpayer
liability
,
some
members
of
Congress
are
insistent
on
using
tax
dollars
as
collateral
for
risky
and
unnecessary
government-backed
deals
.

This
appears
to
be
the
case
with
the
Federal
Housing
Administration
's
mortgage
guarantee
program
.

A
program
created
to
assist
low
-
to
moderate-income
people
,
it
may
soon
be
expanded
to
accommodate
much
higher
loan
amounts
for
well-to-do
home
purchasers
.

The
FHA
now
holds
a
50
%
share
of
the
mortgage
insurance
market
,
while
mismanagement
prevails
throughout
the
agency
.

The
General
Accounting
Office
has
just
completed
an
FHA
financial
audit
showing
a
loss
of
$
4.2
billion
for
fiscal
1988
.

Significant
losses
are
also
expected
for
the
fiscal
year
just
ended
.

Congress
should
not
consider
any
expansion
of
FHA
until
a
comprehensive
,
proven
plan
for
FHA
solvency
and
reform
is
established
.

Ignoring
the
FHA
losses
,
a
few
of
my
colleagues
have
pushed
for
expansion
of
FHA
mortgage
guarantees
by
including
wealthier
home
purchasers
in
the
program
.

The
National
Affordable
Housing
Act
(
Cranston-D'Amato
)
,
introduced
earlier
this
year
,
erases
the
current
mortgage
guarantee
ceiling
of
$
101,250
and
places
a
``
floating
cap
''
at
95
%
of
the
median
home
price
in
higher-cost
areas
.

While
it
increases
FHA
loan-guarantee
amounts
,
this
bill
also
calls
for
the
reduction
of
down-payment
requirements
.

Legislation
of
this
nature
can
be
likened
to
fueling
a
runaway
locomotive
headed
in
the
wrong
direction
.

Studies
consistently
show
,
and
the
GAO
has
admitted
,
that
increasing
loan-to-value
ratios
--
making
higher
loans
without
higher
down-payment
requirements
--
increases
the
risk
of
default
.

Taxpayers
will
be
saddled
with
a
tremendous
financial
burden
if
these
fundamental
data
are
not
heeded
.

Recently
,
a
Senate
Appropriations
bill
similarly
removed
the
current
FHA
mortgage
guarantee
ceiling
and
increased
it
to
95
%
of
the
median
home
price
in
higher-cost
areas
.

This
provision
would
have
nearly
doubled
FHA
loan
exposure
in
skyrocketing
markets
where
median
home
prices
can
range
to
$
200,000
or
more
.

Out
of
concern
for
the
potentially
damaging
effects
of
this
proposal
,
and
still
awaiting
the
GAO
report
on
FHA
losses
,
I
suggested
the
Senate
instead
work
on
ways
to
eliminate
or
substantially
curtail
this
vast
loan-guarantee
expansion
.

After
several
hours
of
floor
debate
and
three
roll-call
votes
,
we
reached
a
compromise
,
placing
the
FHA
loan-guarantee
ceiling
at
$
124,875
.

Although
my
desire
to
retain
the
present
ceiling
was
exceeded
by
$
23,625
,
a
firm
limit
on
loan
guarantees
did
provide
some
consolation
in
the
face
of
allowing
a
haphazard
floating
cap
to
remain
in
the
bill
.

Not
only
is
such
an
FHA
expansion
risky
,
it
is
also
a
direct
government
intrusion
into
a
market
already
served
by
private
mortgage
insurers
.

Private
mortgage
insurers
also
happen
to
be
solvent
.

Yes
,
they
have
higher
down-payment
requirements
.

But
people
who
can
afford
payments
on
a
$
200,000
home
should
be
expected
to
put
more
money
down
.

It
would
be
difficult
to
explain
to
average
American
workers
that
their
tax
dollars
were
being
used
to
guarantee
mortgages
on
$
200,000
homes
.

If
an
FHA
expansion
is
such
a
great
idea
,
why
not
have
the
federal
government
guarantee
all
home
mortgages
?
Congress
can
not
expect
taxpayers
to
continue
bearing
the
burden
of
well-intended
government
guarantees
.

When
Congress
increased
federal
deposit
insurance
to
$
100,000
from
$
40,000
,
it
seemed
like
a
good
idea
.

It
gave
the
appearance
of
a
more
stable
financial
industry
.

It
was
easy
to
extend
a
government
guarantee
to
cover
apparent
problems
.

But
postponing
problems
soon
gave
way
to
a
nightmarish
taxpayer
bailout
to
the
tune
of
over
$
200
billion
.

The
problems
surrounding
the
FHA
must
be
addressed
.

Significant
reforms
must
be
made
.

The
high-risk
venture
of
unnecessarily
expanding
FHA
mortgage
guarantees
without
reform
is
ludicrous
.

The
dollar
rose
yesterday
but
careened
like
a
roller-coaster
in
a
market
that
traders
described
as
volatile
,
confused
and
at
times
frightening
.

And
while
the
U.S.
currency
recovered
much
of
the
lost
ground
from
its
collapse
on
Friday
,
several
dealers
contend
that
its
potential
to
climb
further
could
be
limited
.

In
late
New
York
trading
,
the
dollar
stood
at
1.8685
West
German
marks
and
141.80
yen
,
compared
with
1.8655
marks
and
141.50
yen
late
Friday
.

The
British
pound
declined
to
$
1.5755
from
$
1.5840
before
the
weekend
.

In
early
trading
in
Tokyo
Tuesday
,
the
U.S.
currency
was
changing
hands
at
about
142.15
yen
,
up
from
Tokyo
's
Monday
close
of
140.74
yen
,
and
at
about
1.8665
marks
,
down
a
bit
from
late
trading
Monday
in
New

.

At
times
on

the

followed

like

leash
,
but
only
so
far
.

``
Trading
in
looked
like
the
Dow
's
shadow
,
to
a
point
,
''
said
Jeffrey
M.
Mondschein
,
managing
director
in
charge
of
foreign-exchange
operations
at
Continental
Bank
in
Chicago
.

He
said
the
U.S.
currency
was
having
difficulty
rising
above
the
1.87-mark
level
.

``
If
you
take
away
the
stock-market
brouhaha
of
the
last
few
days
,
you
still
have
lower
{
U.S
.

}
interest
rates
,
lower
{
U.S
.

}
capacity
utilization
,
and
concern
about
quarterly
earnings
and
general
economic
strength
--
or
lack
thereof
,
''
said
Mr.
Mondschein
,
``
so
you
wonder
what
the
level
of
the
dollar
should
be
.

''
Moreover
,
forecasters
predict
that
the
trade
deficit
for
August
,
to
be
released
today
,
will
worsen
to
more
than
$
9
billion
from
$
7.6
billion
the
previous
month
.

The
dollar
's
bumpy
journey
began
late
Sunday
night
in
Far
Eastern
trading
where
panic
selling
in
a
thin
market
initially
pushed
it
as
low
as
1.8305
marks
and
139.10
yen
.

By
the
end
of
trading
in
Tokyo
,
the
dollar
was
quoted
at
1.8470
and
140.73
yen
.

But
the
real
fireworks
began
in
European
and
early
New
York
activity
where
traders
were
whipsawed
by
an
inaccurate
report
of
the
stock
market
's
opening
and
a
statement
by
Federal
Reserve
Board
Chairman
Alan
Greenspan
.

Initially
,
Reuters
reported
that
the
Dow
Jones
Industrial
Average
opened
down
4
%
,
instead
of
the
actual
0.7
%
decline
.

The
mistake
was
quickly
corrected
.

But
the
news
prompted
traders
to
dump
dollars
and
then
almost
immediately
buy
them
back
.

On
its
rebound
,
the
dollar
soared
from
about
1.8480
marks
to
1.8735
,
or
1.4
%
,
within
two-and-a-half
minutes
.

A
spokesman
for
Reuters
in
New
York
confirmed
there
was
an
error
and
that
it
was
quickly
corrected
.

Nonetheless
,
Peter
Stein
,
a
trader
at
Commerzbank
in
Frankfurt
,
said
:
``
It
's
crazy
;
it
's
absolute
madness
.

''
Later
,
news
wires
reported
that
Mr.
Greenspan
said
a
speech
he
delivered
last
week
in
Moscow
had
been
misinterpreted
.

At
the
time
,
many
traders
took
it
to
be
a
signal
that
the
Fed
would
n't
lower
interest
rates
to
weaken
the
dollar
,
and
that
the
U.S.
was
at
odds
with
its
major
trading
partners
in
seeking
to
stabilize
a
high-flying
U.S.
currency
at
a
lower
level
.

The
dollar
promptly
fell
nearly
two
pfennig
to
1.8560
.

``
It
was
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
,
up
and
down
,
''
said
Marcus
Croonen
,
a
trader
at
DG
Bank
in
Frankfurt
.

``
It
was
a
bad
day
.

''
Indeed
,
the
dollar
dropped
4.4
%
against
the
mark
from
its
highs
on
Friday
to
its
Sunday
night
lows
only
to
shoot
back
up
2.4
%
to
its
high
point
yesterday
.

During
the
hectic
activity
,
traders
said
the
Danish
and
Italian
central
banks
intervened
to
defend
their
respective
currencies
against
the
strengthening
mark
.

Roberto
Bianchi
,
a
vice
president
at
Union
Bank
of
Switzerland
,
described
the
market
's
mood
as
confused
.

``
Everybody
keeps
repeating
that
it
's
OK
,
it
's
not
the
same
as
1987
,
the
central
banks
stand
ready
to
stabilize
the
market
,
and
yet
there
is
a
lot
of
uncertainty
.

''
Mr.
Bianchi
said
some
big
European
institutional
investors
were
selling
dollars
in
lots
of
$
100
million
to
$
200
million
.

``
Investors
who
had
been
in
dollars
for
a
long
time
got
out
.

That
led
to
nervousness
in
the
trading
room
,
''
said
Mr.
Bianchi
.

Yet
Heiko
Thieme
,
an
investment
strategist
for
Deutsche
Bank
in
New
York
,
contended
that
Europeans
had
n't
purchased
many
American
shares
this
year
.

Even
so
,
he
's
bullish
.

``
In
my
view
,
the
dollar
is
n't
vulnerable
at
all
.

On
a
fundamental
basis
,
I
'm
not
afraid
about
the
dollar
,
which
runs
more
of
a
risk
of
being
too
strong
than
too
weak
,
''
said
Mr.
Thieme
.

He
expects
the
U.S.
trade
deficit
to
keep
improving
and
the
U.S.
economy
to
expand
at
2
%
to
2.5
%
next
year
.

``
The
recession
fears
are
overdone
and
inflation
hysteria
totally
unfounded
,
''
Mr.
Thieme
argued
.

He
also
said
that
at
about
3
%
of
the
total
output
of
goods
and
services
,
the
U.S.
budget
deficit
is
manageable
.

Thus
,
with
little
risk
of
losing
profits
through
a
deteriorating
currency
,
``
what
you
have
here
is
a
unique
buying
opportunity
,
''
said
Mr.
Thieme
of
the
U.S.
stock
market
.

George
Kuster
,
a
manager
at
Gulf
&
Occidental
Investment
S.A.
in
Geneva
,
agrees
but
only
to
a
point
.

Unlike
October
1987
,
``
this
time
I
was
laughing
.

I
'm
convinced
that
this
{
stock
market
}
is
going
to
go
up
,
''
he
said
.

Nonetheless
,
Mr.
Kuster
added
:
``
I
do
n't
trust
the
U.S.
market
that
much
''
because
of
the
dollar
's
volatility
.

``
My
clients
lost
a
lot
of
money
in
the
1970s
because
of
the
dollar
,
so
I
can
afford
not
to
gain
''
from
U.S.
equities
.

Instead
,
the
Swiss
money
manager
sees
better
opportunities
in
the
Japanese
,
West
German
and
French
markets
.

On
the
Commodity
Exchange
in
New
York
,
gold
for
current
delivery
rose
$
4
to
$
367.30
an
ounce
in
moderate
trading
.

Estimated
volume
was
4.5
million
ounces
.

In
early
trading
in
Hong
Kong
Tuesday
,
gold
was
quoted
at
about
$
366.27
an
ounce
,
down
$
2
an
ounce
from
Monday
.

In
all
the
finger-pointing
in
the
wake
of
Friday
's
stock-market
plunge
,
you
'd
think
the
Transportation
Department
,
of
all
agencies
,
would
be
safe
.

Look
again
.

Some
people
on
Wall
Street
--
and
even
some
in
the
Bush
administration
--
think
that
Transportation
Secretary
Samuel
Skinner
may
have
played
a
second-hand
role
in
the
stock
slide
.

His
drumbeat
of
warnings
on
the
perils
of
airline
leveraged
buy-outs
,
this
theory
goes
,
spooked
major
banks
out
of
bankrolling
the
buy-out
of
UAL
Inc
.

And
that
,
in
turn
,
sent
the
market
into
Friday
's
tailspin
.

Mr.
Skinner
's
LBO
comments
``
probably
helped
discourage
some
of
the
banks
from
participating
''
in
the
UAL
deal
,
says
Louis
Marckesano
,
airline
analyst
for
Janney
Montgomery
Scott
Inc.
,
a
Philadelphia
brokerage
house
.

``
The
government
is
putting
its
nose
where
it
does
n't
belong
,
and
Skinner
is
at
the
head
of
the
pack
.

''
Many
others
--
indeed
,
most
industry
officials
and
members
of
Congress
--
absolve
Mr.
Skinner
,
saying
that
the
UAL
deal
was
flawed
from
the
start
.

But
whether
he
single-handedly
sparked
the
crash
or
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
one
thing
is
clear
in
the
aftermath
of
the
price
slide
:
Sam
Skinner
,
by
his
repeated
jawboning
on
the
buy-out
issue
,
has
irritated
some
in
the
Bush
administration
,
so
much
so
that
some
White
House
officials
want
to
rein
him
in
.

Yesterday
,
for
example
,
the
administration
came
out
in
opposition
to
legislation
to
strengthen
the
Transportation
Department
's
hand
in
blocking
leveraged
buy-outs
--
despite
statements
by
Mr.
Skinner
to
Congress
that
suggested
he
looked
favorably
on
it
,
without
explicitly
endorsing
it
.

Moreover
,
administration
officials
say
that
Office
of
Management
and
Budget
Director
Richard
Darman
,
Treasury
Secretary
Nicholas
Brady
,
Council
of
Economic
Advisers
Michael
Boskin
and
U.S.
Trade
Representative
Carla
Hills
all
have
had
problems
with
Mr.
Skinner
's
jawboning
.

Secretary
Skinner
,
for
his
part
,
says
``
it
's
silly
''
to
blame
him
for
the
market
crash
.

``
The
banks
in
this
country
and
in
Japan
could
n't
put
the
financing
together
on
the
terms
offered
,
''
he
said
in
a
telephone
interview
from
Detroit
,
where
he
was
speaking
to
the
Economic
Club
of
Detroit
.

``
They
have
the
same
kind
of
questions
that
I
raised
about
the
financial
aspects
of
the
transaction
.

''
At
the
very
least
,
the
administration
has
been
sending
mixed
signals
about
leveraged
buy-outs
and
foreign
ownership
of
U.S.
airlines
.

Last
month
,
Mr.
Skinner
forced
Northwest
Airlines
to
reduce
a
stake
held
by
KLM
Royal
Dutch
Airlines
to
ensure
,
he
said
,
that
the
foreign
airline
would
n't
illegally
control
Northwest
.

But
it
is
n't
clear
how
he
would
treat
other
leveraged
buy-outs
.

Each
deal
,
he
insists
,
must
be
handled
separately
,
on
a
``
case-by-case
''
basis
.

That
gives
Mr.
Skinner
lots
of
wiggle
room
,
but
critics
say
it
does
n't
provide
a
clear
picture
to
the
business
community
of
what
would
pass
government
muster
.

``
It
's
a
regulatory
scandal
,
''
says
Timothy
Pettee
,
a
Merrill
Lynch
&
Co.
airline
analyst
,
who
contends
that
the
lack
of
clear
standards
raises
the
specter
of
inconsistent
decision-making
and
unfair
treatment
.

Mr.
Skinner
says
he
has
n't
spelled
out
a
policy
for
leveraged
buy-outs
because
Wall
Street
bankers
and
lawyers
would
simply
find
ways
to
circumvent
it
.

But
others
say
Mr.
Skinner
is
gagged
until
the
Economic
Policy
Council
,
a
cabinet-level
group
that
makes
decisions
on
national
economic
issues
,
finishes
its
ruminations
on
the
issue
.

The
group
is
scheduled
to
discuss
airline
buy-outs
again
today
.

But
although
the
administration
has
yet
to
reach
a
decision
on
airline
buy-outs
,
President
Bush
and
Treasury
Secretary
Brady
in
general
do
n't
have
philosophical
problems
with
leveraged
buy-outs
or
foreign
investment
involving
non-airline
companies
,
and
do
n't
appear
inclined
to
block
them
.

Mr.
Bush
has
n't
yet
focused
on
the
airline
buy-out
question
.

The
buy-out
issue
is
politically
and
financially
complex
because
of
two
separate
but
intertwining
questions
--
foreign
ownership
and
debt
levels
.

Foreign
companies
are
barred
by
law
from
holding
more
than
25
%
voting
stock
,
or
exerting
actual
control
,
over
U.S.
airlines
.

Under
the
original
Northwest
Airlines
bid
,
KLM
would
have
contributed
57
%
of
the
equity
but
received
only
5
%
of
the
voting
stock
.

The
Transportation
Department
concluded
that
was
a
violation
of
the
spirit
,
if
not
the
letter
,
of
the
law
,
and
persuaded
Northwest
to
restructure
the
deal
.

Among
other
things
,
the
Economic
Policy
Council
is
discussing
the
department
's
interpretation
of
the
law
.

It
appears
that
some
leading
administration
officials
believe
the
Northwest
decision
leaves
the
U.S.
open
to
charges
of
protectionism
and
could
undermine
the
U.S.
position
in
international
trade
talks
.

Mr.
Skinner
,
they
complain
,
went
too
far
in
defining
``
control
''
by
American
citizens
and
should
be
discouraged
from
applying
the
same
reasoning
to
future
buy-outs
.

Mr.
Skinner
plays
down
any
rift
in
the
administration
on
the
foreign-ownership
question
.

``
I
think
that
Darman
,
Brady
,
Boskin
and
I
all
have
the
same
basic
understanding
of
the
importance
of
foreign
investment
in
this
country
,
''
he
said
yesterday
.

``
And
they
all
understand
I
have
a
statutory
duty
to
enforce
safety
and
existing
law
regarding
foreign
ownership
.

''
He
and
other
department
officials
argue
that
it
would
be
foolish
to
open
U.S.
markets
to
foreign
carriers
through
investments
,
when
other
countries
are
blocking
expanded
service
by
American
carriers
overseas
.

The
debt
issue
also
is
contentious
.

Mr.
Skinner
says
he
is
concerned
that
heavily
leveraged
airlines
may
be
so
stretched
for
funds
that
safety
will
suffer
.

``
I
have
to
make
sure
that
every
company
spends
the
right
amount
on
maintenance
,
''
he
says
.

But
some
experts
say
that
there
is
n't
a
correlation
between
an
airline
's
debt
load
and
its
safety
record
.

``
No
systematic
link
between
finances
and
safety
has
ever
been
demonstrated
,
''
says
Michael
Levine
,
dean
of
the
Yale
University
School
of
Organization
and
Management
and
formerly
a
top
official
with
the
Civil
Aeronautics
Board
.

Mr.
Skinner
satisfied
his
safety
concerns
on
the
Northwest
deal
by
requiring
the
airline
to
file
certain
financial
information
that
could
affect
safety
,
including
maintenance
expenditures
.

But
now
he
is
under
pressure
by
some
in
Congress
to
extend
those
reporting
requirements
to
other
debt-laden
airlines
that
have
n't
been
involved
in
recent
buy-outs
.

A
final
dispute
involved
in
the
leveraged
buy-out
issue
is
how
much
authority
the
Transportation
Department
should
have
in
dealing
with
LBOs
.

Several
members
of
Congress
,
generally
delighted
with
Mr.
Skinner
's
activist
approach
to
buy-outs
,
want
the
department
to
be
able
to
block
the
deals
before
they
become
final
.

But
the
administration
told
lawmakers
yesterday
that
it
opposed
the
legislation
,
saying
the
government
already
has
enough
authority
.

Currently
,
however
,
the
Transportation
Department
's
authority
over
leveraged
buy-outs
appears
to
some
to
be
a
case
of
too
much
,
too
late
.

The
department
does
n't
have
prior-review
authority
.

In
addition
,
if
it
ca
n't
persuade
a
company
to
restructure
an
unacceptable
buy-out
plan
,
its
only
recourse
is
to
revoke
the
airline
's
certificate
--
in
effect
grounding
the
carrier
.

That
,
says
House
Aviation
Subcommittee
Chairman
James
Oberstar
,
a
Minnesota
Democrat
,
is
like
``
using
a
howitzer
to
go
deer
hunting
.

''
In
a
sign
of
its
continuing
problems
in
the
U.S.
auto
market
,
General
Motors
Corp.
acknowledged
that
a
key
midsized-car
plant
will
shut
down
for
two
weeks
to
cut
bulging
inventories
of
Pontiac
Grand
Prix
models
.

Meanwhile
,
GM
Chairman
Roger
B.
Smith
said
it
should
be
``
no
surprise
''
the
auto
maker
is
moving
to
close
permanently
more
North
American
assembly
plants
.

At
an
Economic
Club
of
Detroit
luncheon
,
Mr.
Smith
said
announcements
last
week
that
indicated
at
least
three
and
perhaps
five
more
GM
plants
in
the
U.S.
and
Canada
may
close
by
the
early
1990s
reflect
``
a
carefully
conceived
,
calculated
and
executed
strategic
plan
.

''
Mr.
Smith
said
GM
is
looking
for
ways
to
save
some
of
the
five
older
plants
targeted
last
week
.

``
I
'm
hoping
we
'll
need
another
plant
for
the
APV
,
''
a
new
plastic-bodied
minivan
now
being
assembled
at
a
single
plant
in
Tarrytown
,
N.Y.
,
he
said
.

However
,
Mr.
Smith
said
that
as
a
result
of
a
$
70
billion
factory-modernization
program
undertaken
over
the
last
decade
,
``
we
can
produce
more
in
the
new
plants
than
we
could
in
the
old
plants
.

''
But
GM
is
also
struggling
with
a
steep
decline
in
U.S.
car-market
share
that
was
n't
part
of
the
company
's
strategic
plans
when
it
began
the
modernization
program
.

The
latest
evidence
of
that
is
the
decision
to
idle
the
Fairfax
,
Kan.
,
plant
that
makes
the
Grand
Prix
less
than
three
weeks
into
the
new
model
year
.

The
Grand
Prix
is
one
of
GM
's
newest
lines
of
cars
,
the
so-called
GM-10
midsized
cars
.

This
fall
,
GM
introduced
the
first
four-door
versions
of
the
cars
--
a
move
that
was
supposed
to
spur
sales
of
the
models
,
which
have
been
disappointing
so
far
.

But
GM
officials
confirmed
they
will
close
the
Fairfax
plant
for
two
weeks
beginning
Oct.
30
because
of
slow
sales
,
bringing
to
10
the
number
of
weeks
it
will
have
been
closed
since
early
June
.

U.S.
car
dealers
had
a
92-day
supply
of
the
cars
at
the
end
of
September
,
according
to
industry
trade
publication
Wards
Automotive
Reports
.

That
's
about
50
%
higher
than
the
60-to-65-day
supply
considered
normal
in
the
industry
.

Union
officials
at
the
Fairfax
plant
said
the
company
is
studying
the
feasibility
of
giving
the
plant
another
product
to
build
,
contrary
to
GM
's
original
plan
.

Company
officials
declined
to
comment
on
this
issue
,
calling
the
talk
``
speculation
.

''
Louisiana-Pacific
Corp.
and
Pope
&
Talbot
Inc.
posted
strong
third-quarter
profit
gains
,
citing
continued
strong
demand
and
firm
prices
in
the
forest-products
business
.

Louisiana-Pacific
reported
a
40
%
increase
in
net
income
to
$
51.5
million
,
or
$
1.34
a
share
,
from
$
36.8
million
,
or
97
cents
a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

Sales
in
the
period
increased
about
10
%
to
$
510.1
million
from
$
462.9
million
.

Harry
A.
Merlo
,
chairman
and
president
,
credited
strong
demand
for
plywood
and
other
building
products
.

The
record
results
came
despite
a
decline
in
operating
results
for
the
company
's
pulp
business
,
he
added
.

This
was
due
in
large
measure
to
a
drought-related
production
curtailment
at
its
Ketchikan
,
Alaska
,
pulp
mill
.

For
the
nine
months
,
the
company
posted
a
34
%
gain
in
net
to
$
139.8
million
,
or
$
3.66
a
share
,
from
$
104.1
million
,
or
$
2.73
a
share
.

The
company
said
it
had
an
11
%
sales
increase
to
$
1.50
billion
from
$
1.35
billion
the
year
earlier
.

(
The
company
's
1988
results
do
n't
include
a
non-recurring
gain
on
the
final
settlement
of
the
Redwood
National
Park
condemnation
in
1988
's
first
quarter
.

)
Pope
&
Talbot
said
healthy
demand
and
prices
,
especially
for
consumer
products
,
led
to
a
55
%
increase
in
third-quarter
net
to
$
13.2
million
,
or
$
1.11
a
share
,
from
$
8.5
million
,
or
71
cents
a
share
.

The
1989
results
include
a
gain
of
$
3.5
million
,
or
29
cents
a
share
,
on
the
sale
of
a
sawmill
.

Sales
in
the
quarter
rose
20
%
to
$
162.1
million
from
$
135.3
million
.

For
the
nine
months
,
the
company
posted
profit
of
$
33.8
million
,
or
$
2.86
a
share
,
including
the
gain
on
the
sawmill
's
sale
.

That
was
up
45
%
from
$
23.3
million
,
or
$
1.95
a
share
,
the
year
earlier
.

Nine-month
sales
grew
26
%
to
$
471.1
million
from
$
373
million
.

Looking
ahead
,
Pope
&
Talbot
said
it
expects
all
of
1989
to
be
a
record
year
.

Louisiana-Pacific
said
fourth-quarter
performance
is
usually
hampered
by
weather-related
construction
slowdowns
,
but
that
``
many
positive
factors
''
should
help
the
period
's
results
.

Some
nervous
market
makers
in
Nasdaq
over-the-counter
stocks
lowered
prices
severely
at
the
start
of
trading
in
response
to
Friday
's
sell-off
.

The
markdowns
were
excessive
,
some
traders
groused
,
and
indeed
the
market
closed
lower
despite
heavy
buying
of
its
leading
technology
stocks
.

After
plummeting
nearly
19
points
almost
immediately
after
trading
began
,
the
Nasdaq
Composite
Index
staged
a
comeback
,
but
still
closed
off
6.31
,
or
1.4
%
,
at
460.98
.

Volume
was
an
astonishing
242.8
million
shares
,
33
%
more
than
the
turnover
on
May
19
,
which
had
been
this
year
's
busiest
day
.

Many
observers
said
yesterday
afternoon
that
the
price-slashing
by
some
market
makers
during
the
last
hour
of
trading
Friday
and
before
the
market
opened
yesterday
was
overdone
.

It
was
,
they
said
,
a
factor
in
why
the
market
did
n't
rally
as
strongly
as
the
biggest
New
York
Stock
Exchange
issues
.

The
Dow
Jones
industrials
rose
3.4
%
.

``
Bids
were
lowered
too
much
,
''
said
Gary
Rosenbach
,
a
market
maker
and
manager
of
equity
trading
at
Needham
&
Co
.

On
Friday
,
the
market
makers
,
who
must
be
prepared
to
buy
stock
when
no
one
else
will
,
were
frantically
cutting
the
prices
at
which
they
would
take
stocks
off
sellers
'
hands
,
in
reaction
to
plunging
prices
on
the
New
York
Stock
Exchange
,
according
to
Mr.
Rosenbach
.

Yesterday
,
they
again
lowered
their
bids
before
trading
began
,
in
anticipation
of
another
wave
of
selling
.

Joseph
Hardiman
,
president
of
the
National
Association
of
Securities
Dealers
,
which
oversees
trading
on
Nasdaq
,
said
that
between
9
a.m.
and
9:30
a.m.
,
the
market
's
Small
Order
Execution
System
was
deluged
with
six
times
the
normal
volume
of
quotation
updates
from
market
makers
and
had
to
be
shut
down
for
nearly
25
minutes
after
trading
began
so
computers
could
digest
the
data
.

Mr.
Hardiman
said
the
system
received
about
102,000
updated
quotes
by
10
a.m.
,
compared
with
20,000
normally
.

He
said
total
volume
on
the
system
,
used
for
trades
of
1,000
shares
or
less
by
non-professional
investors
,
was
2.5
times
busier
than
usual
.

But
,
Mr.
Hardiman
was
n't
complaining
.

``
It
meant
that
market
makers
were
dynamically
updating
their
quotes
,
rather
than
sitting
there
frozen
.

''
Market
makers
defended
their
actions
.

They
said
it
was
reasonable
to
expect
a
rash
of
selling
and
to
lower
prices
in
anticipation
of
it
.

``
Market
makers
saw
sell
orders
first
and
that
's
why
they
(
lowered
bids
)
,
''
said
Brian
Finnerty
,
a
Shearson
Lehman
Hutton
market
maker
.

``
The
buyers
sat
back
and
did
n't
come
in
until
a
half
hour
or
45
minutes
later
.

11:30

''
Some
of
the
biggest
stocks
were
snapped
up
by
bargain
hunters
and
fared
much
better
.

Intel
rose
1
to
33
on
3.7
million
shares
.

Tele-Communications
gained
1
to
19
on
3.7
million
shares
.

MCI
Communications
added
1
to

on
5.6

Apple

advanced
1
to

on
3.8
million
shares
.

Microsoft
jumped
2
to
75
on
1.8
million

.

But
Sun
Microsystems
eased
to
17
on
3.6
million
shares
and
Lotus
Development
was
unchanged
at
29
.

The
result
was
that
the
Nasdaq
100
Index
of
the
big
non-financial
issues
rose
0.56
,
to
449.89
.

The

tracked
by
the
Nasdaq
Financial
Index
,
were
n't
as
popular
,
falling
6.90
,
to
456.08
.

There
was
some
favorable
takeover
news
,
in
stark
contrast
to
Friday
,
when
nervousness
about
the
future
of
leveraged
buy-outs
hurt
takeover-related
issues
.

National
Pizza
said
it
signed
a
definitive
agreement
to
acquire
Skipper
's
for
$
11.50
a
share
.

The
company
said
the
acquisition
,
valued
at
about
$
31.3
million
,
is
subject
to
the
condition
that
at
least
two-thirds
of
the
Skipper
's
shares
outstanding
are
tendered
.

National
Pizza
also
said
it
settled
its
dispute
with
PepsiCo
's
Pizza
Hut
unit
that
had
threatened
to
scuttle
the
proposed
acquisition
.

Skipper
's
rose
to
11
and
National
Pizza
was
unchanged
at
17
.

Among
other
takeover-related
issues
,
LIN
Broadcasting
fell
2
to
104
.

McCaw
Cellular
Communications
,
a
LIN
suitor
,
rose
1
to
41
.

The
biggest
percentage
advancer
was
Grayhound
Electronics
,
which
jumped
73
%
,
or
7
,
to
17
.

The
stock
rose
after
Grayhound
said
it

enter
into

five-year
joint

with
Lermer

Soviet
leader
Mikhail
Gorbachev
wants
to
bring
the
nation
's
reformist
press
back
into
line
,
blaming
it
for
contributing
to
the
many
problems
he
faces
and
even
suggesting
that
one
liberal
editor
resign
.

Mr.
Gorbachev
's
comments
,
made
at
a
meeting
with
Soviet
national
editors
and
media
executives
Friday
,
indicate
his
growing
frustration
with
the
nation
's
mounting
problems
.

According
to
people
who
attended
,
he
did
n't
advocate
an
end
to
glasnost
,
his
policy
of
openness
.

But
he
made
clear
that
the
press
should
show
greater
responsibility
in
its
reporting
and
cut
back
on
criticism
of
his
reforms
.

The
text
of
his
remarks
has
n't
been
published
,
and
editors
say
they
have
no
instructions
as
to
whether
it
will
be
.

Accounts
of
previous
such
meetings
with
media
and
other
groups
have
been
printed
,
sometimes
after
a
delay
of
several
days
.

Although
glasnost
has
given
the
government-controlled
media
here
much
greater
freedom
to
report
and
criticize
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
and
other
Soviet
leaders
still
regard
newspapers
and
TV
as
important
propaganda
tools
they
can
use
at
will
.

According
to
participants
at
the
meeting
and
Soviet
journalists
who
were
later
briefed
by
their
editors
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
blamed
the
press
for
fueling
a
nationwide
mood
of
despondency
.

In
particular
,
he
complained
about
some
articles
this
summer
that
openly
discussed
the
possibility
of
a
coup
or
civil
war
in
the
Soviet
Union
,
and
accused
the
media
of
fueling
panic
buying
of
goods
by
printing
stories
about
impending
shortages
.

He
singled
out
the
daily
Izvestia
and
the
weekly
Argumenty
i
Fakty
,
and
also
gave
stinging
criticism
of
Yuri
Afanasyev
,
a
leading
reformist
historian
who
has
written
articles
attacking
the
Communist
Party
.

Among
other
things
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
questioned
whether
Mr.
Afanasyev
should
remain
in
the
party
.

The
meeting
lasted
a
little
under
two
hours
and
was
attended
by
most
members
of
the
ruling
Politburo
.

There
was
no
other
speaker
apart
from
the
Soviet
leader
,
and
those
attacked
were
n't
given
the
opportunity
to
defend
themselves
.

Mr.
Afanasyev
,
who
is
n't
an
editor
,
did
n't
attend
.

According
to
participants
,
Mr.
Gorbachev
was
particularly
incensed
by
an
article
on
the
front
page
of
Argumenty
i
Fakty
this
month
that
examined
the
popularity
of
members
of
the
Soviet
Parliament
.

The
piece
was
based
on
a
survey
of
1,500
readers
'
letters
and
contained
some
criticism
of
Mr.
Gorbachev
himself
.

The
newspaper
wrote
that
readers
assessed
his
role
both
positively
and
negatively
.

It
said
many
thanked
the
Soviet
leader
for
his
``
self-control
,
modesty
,
culture
and
ability
to
hear
a
speaker
out
.

''
But
others
criticized
him
,
``
for
imposing
his
opinion
on
other
deputies
,
giving
commentaries
to
many
speeches
,
holding
elections
with
no
choice
of
candidate
,
putting
pressure
on
the
voting
process
and
maneuvering
between
the
right
and
left
wings
''
of
the
Parliament
.

All
this
,
the
paper
quoted
readers
as
saying
,
``
has
seriously
weakened
his
authority
.

''
The
Soviet
leader
apparently
suggested
to
Argumenty
i
Fakty
's
editor
,
Vyacheslav
Starkov
,
that
he
should
resign
.

The
comment
,
which
Mr.
Starkov
relayed
to
his
staff
,
has
sparked
anger
and
bitterness
at
the
paper
.

Mr.
Starkov
has
been
summoned
to
see
the
Kremlin
's
ideology
chief
,
Vadim
Medvedev
,
in
the
near
future
,
and
may
discover
then
if
he
is
to
be
fired
.

Izvestia
was
criticized
for
a
front-page
article
last
Wednesday
that
took
a
sharp
look
at
the
Parliament
's
activities
.

It
attacked
the
level
of
a
debate
on
the
private-sector
cooperative
movement
,
saying
``
the
discussion
was
more
like
a
riot
than
a
civilized
exchange
of
points
of
view
.

''
And
it
questioned
the
speed
with
which
the
Parliament
was
adopting
new
legislation
,
often
with
a
minimum
of
debate
.

Speaking
to
foreign
reporters
,
Ivan
Laptev
,
Izvestia
's
editor
,
sought
to
play
down
Mr.
Gorbachev
's
criticism
,
but
he
acknowledged
that
his
paper
had
been
singled
out
.

The
Parliament
yesterday
approved
legislation
that
imposes
new
restrictions
on
the
cooperative
movement
,
enabling
local
authorities
to
set
ceilings
for
prices
and
preventing
the
``
speculative
''
sale
of
goods
in
short
supply
for
prices
higher
than
that
charged
by
the
state
.

that
the

have
forged
,
particularly
in

commercial
hype

the
``

gift-giving
season
is
an
immense
compliment
to
American
assistance
to
Korea

who
were
personal

participants
in
the
days
when
the
U.S.
was
able
to
supply
needed
material
and
morale
boosts
to
a
destitute
nation
,
now
rejoice
that
the
better
life
we
thought
possible
for

has
come
to

takeover-stock
speculators
yesterday
suffered
their
worst
bloodbath
since
the
Black
Monday
crash
of
October
1987
.

Even
as
the
stock
market
rebounded
from
Friday
's
190.58-point
rout
,
takeover
traders
were
hammered
by
setbacks
in
two
big
airline
takeover
deals
.

Some
analysts
estimated
that
paper
losses
could
total
$
500
million
for
the
takeover
traders
,
known
as
risk
arbitragers
,
or
``
arbs
.

''
Nearly
all
of
the
big
paper
losses
were
caused
by
declines
of
more
than
20
%
in
two
airline
stocks
,
UAL
Corp.
and
AMR
Corp
.

Wall
Street
's
arbitrage
desks
had
loaded
up
on
stocks
of
both
companies
after
each
had
received
takeover
proposals
from
investors
.

The
bid
for
UAL
came
from
Marvis
Davis
of
Beverly
Hills
,
Calif.
,
and
the
bid
for
AMR
came
from
Donald
Trump
of
New
York
.

But
in
the
wake
of
Friday
's
announcement
that
a
UAL
management-union
group
could
n't
obtain
bank
financing
for
its
agreement
to
buy
UAL
at
$
300
a
share
,
UAL
stock
plunged
$
56.875
yesterday
to
close
at
$
222.875
a
share
in
New
York
Stock
Exchange
composite
trading
of
nearly
2.3
million
shares
.

On
Friday
,
the
stock
did
n't
trade
after
the
buy-out
group
announced
its
financing
troubles
.

That
was
bad
enough
for
the
arbs
.

``
On
balance
,
the
Street
's
biggest
position
has
been
UAL
,
mostly
{
bought
}
in
the
$
280
range
,
''
said
Frank
Gallagher
,
director
of
Phoenix
Capital
Markets
,
who
follows
arbitrage
activity
.

But
the
arbs
were
quickly
hit
with
another
dose
of
bad
news
when
Mr.
Trump
announced
that
he
was
withdrawing
his
proposal
to
buy
AMR
at
$
120
a
share
.

After
trading
in
AMR
resumed
,
the
stock
fell
sharply
to
close
at
$
76.50
a
share
,
down
$
22.125
on
the
day
in
Big
Board
composite
trading
of
more
than
4.7
million
shares
.

Mr.
Gallagher
estimates
that
arbitragers
owned
the
equivalent
of
nearly
30
%
of
UAL
's
stock
,
or
about
six
million
shares
,
indicating
losses
of
about
$
350
million
.

He
estimates
that
arbs
own
the
equivalent
of
about
10
%
of
AMR
's
stock
,
also
about
six
million
shares
,
indicating
an
additional
$
130
million
in
losses
.

Several
other
stocks
owned
by
takeover
traders
continued
to
fall
.

Many
takeover
stocks
rebounded
somewhat
yeterday
,
but
none
made
up
all
of
their
sharp
declines
on
Friday
.

Despite
the
losses
,
there
have
n't
been
any
reports
of
arbitrage
or
brokerage
firms
that
have
encountered
serious
financial
difficulties
.

For
most
takeover-stock
traders
,
huge
profits
from
booming
takeover
activity
last
year
would
provide
a
cushion
against
current
losses
.

Arbitragers
at
several
major
Wall
Street
securities
firms
said
that
UAL
was
by
far
the
biggest
stock
position
that
they
owned
.

They
also
believe
that
UAL
was
the
biggest
position
for
most
other
arbs
.

``
In
the
arbitrage
community
,
UAL
was
viewed
as
being
a
very
safe
deal
,
''
said
one
trader
.

Arbs
believed
that
major
banks
would
easily
finance
the
UAL
buy-out
group
's
$
6.79
billion
bid
,
and
were
stunned
on
Friday
when
the
group
could
n't
obtain
the
necessary
loans
.

Several
traders
said
they
were
n't
selling
UAL
shares
because
they
believe
the
buy-out
group
will
be
able
to
obtain
financing
to
complete
the
acquisition
eventually
,
although
perhaps
at
a
price
of
less
than
$
300
a
share
.

Mr.
Gallagher
thinks
that
much
of
the
heavy
trading
in
UAL
shares
was
``
one
arb
passing
it
on
to
another
.

I
do
n't
think
you
have
institutional
investors
buying
the
stock
.

''
Gainers
among
the
arb
's
favorite
stocks
included
Hilton
Hotels
Corp.
,
which
rose
$
9.50
a
share
to
close
at
$
94.50
in
Big
Board
composite
trading
,
and
Warner
Communications
Inc.
,
which
rose
$
1.875
to
close
at
$
63.375
.

Hilton
is
soliciting
bids
for
some
or
all
of
its
hotel
and
casino
operations
;
Warner
is
being
acquired
by
Time
Warner
Inc.
,
which
already
owns
about
58
%
of
Warner
.

The
past
two
trading
days
,
while
painful
,
have
n't
been
as
disastrous
for
the
arbs
as
the
October
1987
market
crash
because
takeover-related
stocks
have
n't
dropped
as
sharply
as
they
did
two
years
ago
,
and
traders
are
n't
as
deeply
in
debt
as
they
were
then
.

On
Friday
and
yesterday
,
the
worst
price
declines
among
takeover-related
stocks
were
about
20
%
,
with
most
takeover
stocks
falling
between
5
%
and
15
%
.

In
October
1987
,
however
,
stocks
of
some
potential
takeover
targets
,
such
as
Dayton
Hudson
Corp.
,
fell
about
50
%
,
Mr.
Gallagher
said
.

A
trader
at
one
major
Wall
Street
firm
said
his
arbitrage
desk
had
about
30
%
of
its
capital
currently
invested
in
cash
.

Two
years
ago
,
he
said
,
his
firm
had
borrowed
an
amount
equal
to
about
30
%
of
its
capital
so
that
it
could
buy
more
stocks
.

Mr.
Gallagher
said
he
believes
that
situation
is
typical
of
the
more
conservative
strategies
that
many
arbitragers
adopted
after
the
crash
.

When
traders
borrow
money
to
buy
additional
amounts
of
stock
,
they
run
the
risk
of
having
to
sell
stocks
after
a
sharp
price
decline
such
as
yesterday
's
to
meet
margin
calls
.

Margin
calls
are
demands
by
lenders
that
traders
put
up
more
cash
to
make
up
for
declines
in
the
value
of
stocks
that
serve
as
collateral
for
loans
.

One
trader
,
however
,
said
he
believes
that
most
of
the
selling
in
takeover-related
stocks
in
the
past
two
trading
days
has
been
the
result
of
judgments
by
traders
that
takeover
bids
are
less
likely
to
be
completed
,
rather
than
selling
prompted
by
margin
calls
.

Stocks
in

speculators
have
large
positions
In
response
to
your
extracts
from
David
Fenton
's
memo
(
``
How
a
PR
Firm
Executed
the
Alar
Scare
,
''
editorial
page
,
Oct.
3
)
:
For
the
past
10
years
,
the
Environmental
Protection
Agency
has
known
about
the
carcinogenic
hazards
of
Alar
,
and
has
carried
on
proceedings
to
remove
the
chemical
from
the
market
.

Yet
until
recently
,
no
significant
progress
had
occurred
because
the
pesticide
manufacturers
and
other
special
interests
have
blocked
necessary
congressional
reform
,
stymied
EPA
actions
to
cancel
Alar
and
other
hazardous
pesticides
,
and
kept
the
public
in
the
dark
about
the
threat
of
pesticides
.

In
this
country
,
major
reforms
occur
only
when
substantial
public
pressure
is
applied
to
the
government
and
Congress
in
order
to
counteract
the
lockhold
of
special
interests
.

Therefore
,
the
Natural
Resources
Defense
Council
specifically
chose
to
inform
the
public
about
the
risks
posed
by
pesticides
in
foods
.

To
move
the
pesticide-reform
agenda
,
NRDC
--
like
any
major
corporation
or
the
government
--
used
the
professional
communication
skills
of
a
public-relations
firm
to
educate
the
public
about
the
results
of
our
two-year-long
scientific
study
on
pesticides
residues
in
children
's
food
.

NRDC
offers
no
apologies
for
making
public
the
results
of
our
report
on
pesticides
in
the
diet
of
preschoolers
.

We
will
continue
to
present
the
facts
about
pesticides
in
food
to
the
broadest
possible
segment
of
society
.

Americans
have
a
right
to
know
what
is
in
their
food
and
to
do
something
about
it
if
they
choose
.

Until
the
food
supply
is
safe
,
especially
for
children
,
NRDC
will
keep
doing
everything
we
can
to
educate
the
public
about
the
unnecessary
and
intolerable
risk
of
pesticides
.

John

New

Mr.
Fenton
's
PR
firm
has
abused
the
trust
of
the
media
and
done
the
public
no
favor
.

Just
as
you
can
yell
``
wolf
''
only
so
many
times
before
people
cease
to
heed
you
,
a
PR
firm
can
manipulate
the
press
only
once
,
and
then
it
loses
all
credibility
.

Such
firms
go
quickly
bankrupt
.

C.
Brian
Maddox
New
York
I
was
fascinated
to
read
political
publicist
David
Fenton
's
self-serving
celebration
of
his
own
work
in
creating
the
illusion
that
Alar
was
``
an
intolerable
risk
''
to
Americans
--
particularly
American
children
--
when
used
on
apples
.

(
The
one
``
fact
''
that
caught
my
eye
--
the
alleged
$
700,000
paid
by
the
apple
growers
to
Hill
&
Knowlton
--
was
overstated
by
more
than
a
factor
of
two
.

)
While
I
doubt
the
media
were
as
gullible
and
malleable
as
Mr.
Fenton
's
memo
suggests
,
the
Alar
scare
was
created
,
mostly
out
of
thin
air
,
just
as
Mr.
Fenton
claims
,
and
the
media
that
were
taken
in
can
learn
something
from
this
episode
.

So
,
for
that
matter
,
can
other
industries
subject
to
this
kind
of
guerrilla
PR
attack
.

Mr.
Fenton
says
it
was
not
the
intent
of
the
NRDC
to
have
school
systems
ban
apples
.

Am
I
also
to
believe
that
Meryl
Streep
did
not
intend
to
harm
apple
growers
by
condemning
the
use
of
Alar
?
Well
,
apple
growers
were
hurt
and
many
others
were
needlessly
frightened
by
this
news
story
.

Scientific
fact
was
replaced
with
media
hype
produced
by
genuinely
concerned
but
irrational
people
who
created
a
dangerous
phenomenon
when
,
by
using
bad
information
and
bad
logic
,
they
skillfully
frightened
people
about
agricultural
chemicals
.

My
family
and
I
will
continue
to
believe
the
FDA
,
USDA
,
EPA
and
the
surgeon
general
and
follow
their
nutritional
guidelines
to
eat
a
balanced
diet
that
includes
many
fresh
fruits
and
vegetables
